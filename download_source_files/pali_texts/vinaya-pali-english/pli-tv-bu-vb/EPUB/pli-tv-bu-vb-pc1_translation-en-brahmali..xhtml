<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Namo tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammāsambuddhassa.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Ime kho panāyasmanto dvenavuti pācittiyā dhammā uddesaṁ āgacchanti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Venerables, these ninety-two rules on confession come up for recitation. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tena samayena buddho bhagavā sāvatthiyaṁ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme.</span></p>
<p class="p3">At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tena kho pana samayena hatthako sakyaputto vādakkhitto hoti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Hatthaka the Sakyan had been beaten in debate. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">So titthiyehi saddhiṁ sallapanto avajānitvā paṭijānāti, paṭijānitvā avajānāti, aññenaññaṁ paṭicarati, sampajānamusā bhāsati, saṅketaṁ katvā visaṁvādeti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">While talking with the monastics of other religions, he would assert things after denying them, and he would deny things after asserting them. He evaded the issues, lied, and made sham appointments. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Titthiyā ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti—“kathañhi nāma hatthako sakyaputto amhehi saddhiṁ sallapanto avajānitvā paṭijānissati, paṭijānitvā avajānissati, aññenaññaṁ paṭicarissati, sampajānamusā bhāsissati, saṅketaṁ katvā visaṁvādessatī”ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">The monastics of other religions complained and criticized him, “When Hatthaka talks with us, how can he assert things after denying them, deny things after asserting them, evade the issues, lie, and make sham appointments?” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Assosuṁ kho bhikkhū tesaṁ titthiyānaṁ ujjhāyantānaṁ khiyyantānaṁ vipācentānaṁ.</span></p>
<p class="p3">The monks heard the complaints of those monastics of other religions. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho te bhikkhū yena hatthako sakyaputto tenupasaṅkamiṁsu; upasaṅkamitvā hatthakaṁ sakyaputtaṁ etadavocuṁ—</span></p>
<p class="p3">They then went to Hatthaka and said, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“saccaṁ kira tvaṁ, āvuso hatthaka, titthiyehi saddhiṁ sallapanto avajānitvā paṭijānāsi, paṭijānitvā avajānāsi, aññenaññaṁ paṭicarasi, sampajānamusā bhāsasi, saṅketaṁ katvā visaṁvādesī”ti?</span></p>
<p class="p3">“Is it true, Hatthaka, that you’re doing this?” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Ete kho, āvuso, titthiyā nāma yena kenaci jetabbā;</span></p>
<p class="p3">“These monastics of other religions should be beaten, whatever it takes! </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">neva tesaṁ jayo dātabbo”ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">They shouldn’t be allowed to win.” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Ye te bhikkhū appicchā …pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti—</span></p>
<p class="p3">The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“kathañhi nāma hatthako sakyaputto titthiyehi saddhiṁ sallapanto avajānitvā paṭijānissati, paṭijānitvā avajānissati, aññenaññaṁ paṭicarissati, sampajānamusā bhāsissati, saṅketaṁ katvā visaṁvādessatī”ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">“When Hatthaka talks with the monastics of other religions, how can he assert things after denying them, deny things after asserting them, evade the issues, lie, and make sham appointments?” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho te bhikkhū hatthakaṁ sakyaputtaṁ anekapariyāyena vigarahitvā bhagavato etamatthaṁ ārocesuṁ.</span></p>
<p class="p3">After rebuking Hatthaka in many ways, they told the Buddha. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho bhagavā etasmiṁ nidāne etasmiṁ pakaraṇe bhikkhusaṅghaṁ sannipātāpetvā hatthakaṁ sakyaputtaṁ paṭipucchi—</span></p>
<p class="p3">Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Hatthaka: </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“saccaṁ kira tvaṁ, hatthaka, titthiyehi saddhiṁ sallapanto avajānitvā paṭijānāsi, paṭijānitvā avajānāsi, aññenaññaṁ paṭicarasi, sampajānamusā bhāsasi, saṅketaṁ katvā visaṁvādesī”ti?</span></p>
<p class="p3">“Is it true, Hatthaka, that you’re doing this?” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Saccaṁ, bhagavā”ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">“It’s true, Sir.” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Vigarahi buddho bhagavā …pe…</span></p>
<p class="p3">The Buddha rebuked him … </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">kathañhi nāma tvaṁ, moghapurisa, titthiyehi saddhiṁ sallapanto avajānitvā paṭijānissasi, paṭijānitvā avajānissasi, aññenaññaṁ paṭicarissasi, sampajānamusā bhāsissasi, saṅketaṁ katvā visaṁvādessasi.</span></p>
<p class="p3">“Foolish man, how can you do this? </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Netaṁ, moghapurisa, appasannānaṁ vā pasādāya …pe…</span></p>
<p class="p3">This will affect people’s confidence …” … </p>

<p class="p3"><span class="t5">evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṁ sikkhāpadaṁ uddiseyyātha—</span></p>
<p class="p3">“And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Sampajānamusāvāde pācittiyan”ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">‘If a monk lies in full awareness, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” </p>
