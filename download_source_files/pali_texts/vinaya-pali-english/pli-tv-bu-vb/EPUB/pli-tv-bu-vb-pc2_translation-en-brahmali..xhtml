<p class="p3">At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tena kho pana samayena chabbaggiyā bhikkhū pesalehi bhikkhūhi saddhiṁ bhaṇḍantā pesale bhikkhū omasanti—</span></p>
<p class="p3">the monks from the group of six were arguing with and speaking abusively to the good monks. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">They reviled and insulted them about their caste, name, family, occupation, profession, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offenses, and by calling them names. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Ye te bhikkhū appicchā …pe… te ujjhāyanti khiyyanti vipācenti—</span></p>
<p class="p3">The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“kathañhi nāma chabbaggiyā bhikkhū pesalehi bhikkhūhi saddhiṁ bhaṇḍantā pesale bhikkhū omasissanti—</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho te bhikkhū chabbaggiye bhikkhū anekapariyāyena vigarahitvā bhagavato etamatthaṁ ārocesuṁ …pe…</span></p>
<p class="p3">After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“saccaṁ kira tumhe, bhikkhave, pesalehi bhikkhūhi saddhiṁ bhaṇḍantā pesale bhikkhū omasatha—jātiyāpi …pe… hīnenapi akkosena khuṁsetha vambhethā”ti?</span></p>
<p class="p3">“Is it true, monks, that you’re doing this?” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Saccaṁ, bhagavā”ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">“It’s true, Sir.” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Vigarahi buddho bhagavā …pe…</span></p>
<p class="p3">The Buddha rebuked them … </p>

<p class="p3">… and after rebuking them … </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">dhammiṁ kathaṁ katvā bhikkhū āmantesi—</span></p>
<p class="p3">he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Bhūtapubbaṁ, bhikkhave, takkasilāyaṁ aññatarassa brāhmaṇassa nandivisālo nāma balībaddo ahosi.</span></p>
<p class="p3">“Once upon a time, monks, there was a brahmin in Takkasilā who had an ox called Nandivisāla. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho, bhikkhave, nandivisālo balībaddo taṁ brāhmaṇaṁ etadavoca—</span></p>
<p class="p3">On one occasion the ox said to that brahmin, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘gaccha tvaṁ, brāhmaṇa, seṭṭhinā saddhiṁ sahassena abbhutaṁ karohi—</span></p>
<p class="p3">‘Go, brahmin, and bet a thousand coins with the wealthy merchant that your ox will pull one hundred carts tied together.’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">mayhaṁ balībaddo sakaṭasataṁ atibaddhaṁ pavaṭṭessatī’ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3"/>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho, bhikkhave, so brāhmaṇo seṭṭhinā saddhiṁ sahassena abbhutaṁ akāsi—</span></p>
<p class="p3">And that brahmin did just that. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">mayhaṁ balībaddo sakaṭasataṁ atibaddhaṁ pavaṭṭessatīti.</span></p>
<p class="p3"/>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho, bhikkhave, so brāhmaṇo sakaṭasataṁ atibandhitvā nandivisālaṁ balībaddaṁ yuñjitvā etadavoca—</span></p>
<p class="p3">Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘gaccha, kūṭa, vahassu, kūṭā’ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">‘Go, you fraud! Pull, you liar!’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho, bhikkhave, nandivisālo balībaddo tattheva aṭṭhāsi.</span></p>
<p class="p3">But Nandivisāla didn’t budge. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho, bhikkhave, so brāhmaṇo sahassena parājito pajjhāyi.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Then that brahmin became depressed because he had lost a thousand coins. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho, bhikkhave, nandivisālo balībaddo taṁ brāhmaṇaṁ etadavoca—</span></p>
<p class="p3">Nandivisāla said to him, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘kissa tvaṁ, brāhmaṇa, pajjhāyasī’ti?</span></p>
<p class="p3">‘Why are you depressed?’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘Tathā hi panāhaṁ, bho, tayā sahassena parājito’ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">‘Because I lost one thousand coins because of you.’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘Kissa pana maṁ tvaṁ, brāhmaṇa, akūṭaṁ kūṭavādena pāpesi?</span></p>
<p class="p3">‘But why did you disgrace me by calling me a fraud when I’m not? </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Gaccha tvaṁ, brāhmaṇa, seṭṭhinā saddhiṁ dvīhi sahassehi abbhutaṁ karohi—</span></p>
<p class="p3">Now go, brahmin, and make the same bet with that merchant, but increase the stakes to two thousand coins. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“mayhaṁ balībaddo sakaṭasataṁ atibaddhaṁ pavaṭṭessatī”’ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3"/>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘Mā ca maṁ akūṭaṁ kūṭavādena pāpesī’ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Just don’t disgrace me by calling me a fraud.’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho, bhikkhave, so brāhmaṇo seṭṭhinā saddhiṁ dvīhi sahassehi abbhutaṁ akāsi—</span></p>
<p class="p3">Once again that brahmin did just that. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘mayhaṁ balībaddo sakaṭasataṁ atibaddhaṁ pavaṭṭessatī’ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3"/>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho, bhikkhave, so brāhmaṇo sakaṭasataṁ atibandhitvā nandivisālaṁ balībaddaṁ yuñjitvā etadavoca—</span></p>
<p class="p3">Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘gaccha, bhadra, vahassu, bhadrā’ti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">‘Go, good ox! Pull, good ox!’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho, bhikkhave, nandivisālo balībaddo sakaṭasataṁ atibaddhaṁ pavaṭṭesi.</span></p>
<p class="p3">And Nandivisāla pulled those one hundred carts. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Manāpameva bhāseyya,</span></p>
<p class="p3">‘One should say what’s pleasant, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">nāmanāpaṁ kudācanaṁ;</span></p>
<p class="p3">Never what’s unpleasant. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Manāpaṁ bhāsamānassa,</span></p>
<p class="p3">Because of his pleasant speech, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">garuṁ bhāraṁ udabbahi;</span></p>
<p class="p3">Heavy loads were pulled, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Dhanañca naṁ alābhesi,</span></p>
<p class="p3">And he obtained wealth; </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">tena cattamano ahūti.</span></p>
<p class="p3">And he was delighted with that.’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tadāpi me, bhikkhave, amanāpā khuṁsanā vambhanā.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Even at that time, monks, reviling and insulting was unpleasant to me. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Kimaṅgaṁ pana etarahi manāpā bhavissati khuṁsanā vambhanā?</span></p>
<p class="p3">How then could reviling and insulting be pleasant now? </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Netaṁ, bhikkhave, appasannānaṁ vā pasādāya …pe…</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">evañca pana, bhikkhave, imaṁ sikkhāpadaṁ uddiseyyātha—</span></p>
<p class="p3">“And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Omasavāde pācittiyan”ti.</span></p>
