<p class="p3"><span class="t4">13. Bhayavagga  - 13. Fears </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Cattārome, bhikkhave, puggalā santo saṃvijjamānā lokasmiṃ. </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Mendicants, these four people are found in the world. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Katame cattāro? </span></p>
<p class="p3">What four? </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. </span></p>
<p class="p3">Firstly, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">So tadassādeti, taṃ nikāmeti, tena ca vittiṃ āpajjati. </span></p>
<p class="p3">They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tattha ṭhito tadadhimutto tabbahulavihārī aparihīno kālaṃ kurumāno brahmakāyikānaṃ devānaṃ sahabyataṃ upapajjati. </span></p>
<p class="p3">If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of Brahmā’s Host. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Brahmakāyikānaṃ, bhikkhave, devānaṃ kappo āyuppamāṇaṃ. </span></p>
<p class="p3">The lifespan of the gods of Brahma’s Host is one eon. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tattha puthujjano yāvatāyukaṃ ṭhatvā yāvatakaṃ tesaṃ devānaṃ āyuppamāṇaṃ taṃ sabbaṃ khepetvā nirayampi gacchati tiracchānayonimpi gacchati pettivisayampi gacchati. </span></p>
<p class="p3">An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Bhagavato pana sāvako tattha yāvatāyukaṃ ṭhatvā yāvatakaṃ tesaṃ devānaṃ āyuppamāṇaṃ taṃ sabbaṃ khepetvā tasmiṃyeva bhave parinibbāyati. </span></p>
<p class="p3">But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they’re extinguished in that very life. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Ayaṃ kho, bhikkhave, viseso ayaṃ adhippayāso idaṃ nānākaraṇaṃ sutavato ariyasāvakassa assutavatā puthujjanena, yadidaṃ gatiyā upapattiyā sati. </span></p>
<p class="p3">This is the difference between an educated noble disciple and an uneducated ordinary person, that is, when there is a place of rebirth. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Puna caparaṃ, bhikkhave, idhekacco puggalo vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā ajjhattaṃ sampasādanaṃ cetaso ekodibhāvaṃ avitakkaṃ avicāraṃ samādhijaṃ pītisukhaṃ dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. </span></p>
<p class="p3">As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">So tadassādeti, taṃ nikāmeti, tena ca vittiṃ āpajjati. </span></p>
<p class="p3">They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tattha ṭhito tadadhimutto tabbahulavihārī aparihīno kālaṃ kurumāno ābhassarānaṃ devānaṃ sahabyataṃ upapajjati. </span></p>
<p class="p3">If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of streaming radiance. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Ābhassarānaṃ, bhikkhave, devānaṃ dve kappā āyuppamāṇaṃ. </span></p>
<p class="p3">The lifespan of the gods of streaming radiance is two eons. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tattha puthujjano yāvatāyukaṃ ṭhatvā yāvatakaṃ tesaṃ devānaṃ āyuppamāṇaṃ taṃ sabbaṃ khepetvā nirayampi gacchati tiracchānayonimpi gacchati pettivisayampi gacchati. </span></p>
<p class="p3">An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Bhagavato pana sāvako tattha yāvatāyukaṃ ṭhatvā yāvatakaṃ tesaṃ devānaṃ āyuppamāṇaṃ taṃ sabbaṃ khepetvā tasmiṃyeva bhave parinibbāyati. </span></p>
<p class="p3">But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they’re extinguished in that very life. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">So tadassādeti, taṃ nikāmeti, tena ca vittiṃ āpajjati. </span></p>

<p class="p3">If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods replete with glory. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Subhakiṇhānaṃ, bhikkhave, devānaṃ cattāro kappā āyuppamāṇaṃ. </span></p>
<p class="p3">The lifespan of the gods replete with glory is four eons. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tattha puthujjano yāvatāyukaṃ ṭhatvā yāvatakaṃ tesaṃ devānaṃ āyuppamāṇaṃ taṃ sabbaṃ khepetvā nirayampi gacchati tiracchānayonimpi gacchati pettivisayampi gacchati. </span></p>

<p class="p3">Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">So tadassādeti, taṃ nikāmeti, tena ca vittiṃ āpajjati. </span></p>

<p class="p3">If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of abundant fruit. </p>
