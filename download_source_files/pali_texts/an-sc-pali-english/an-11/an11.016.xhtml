<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Ekaṃ samayaṃ āyasmā ānando vesāliyaṃ viharati beluvagāmake. </span></p>
<p class="p3">At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tena kho pana samayena dasamo gahapati aṭṭhakanāgaro pāṭaliputtaṃ anuppatto hoti kenacideva karaṇīyena. </span></p>
<p class="p3">Now at that time the householder Dasama from the city of Aṭṭhaka had arrived at Pāṭaliputta on some business. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho dasamo gahapati aṭṭhakanāgaro yena kukkuṭārāmo yena aññataro bhikkhu tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā taṃ bhikkhuṃ etadavoca: </span></p>
<p class="p3">He went to the Chicken Monastery, approached a certain mendicant, and said to him, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“kahaṃ nu kho, bhante, āyasmā ānando etarahi viharati? </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Sir, where is Venerable Ānanda now staying? </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Dassanakāmā hi mayaṃ, bhante, āyasmantaṃ ānandan”ti. </span></p>
<p class="p3">For I want to see him.” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Eso, gahapati, āyasmā ānando vesāliyaṃ viharati beluvagāmake”ti. </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Householder, Venerable Ānanda is staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho dasamo gahapati aṭṭhakanāgaro pāṭaliputte taṃ karaṇīyaṃ tīretvā yena vesālī beluvagāmako yenāyasmā ānando tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho dasamo gahapati aṭṭhakanāgaro āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ etadavoca: </span></p>
<p class="p3">Then the householder Dasama, having concluded his business there, went to the little village of Beluva in Vesālī to see Ānanda. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda: </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“atthi nu kho, bhante ānanda, tena bhagavatā jānatā passatā arahatā sammāsambuddhena ekadhammo sammadakkhāto, yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati, aparikkhīṇā vā āsavā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, ananuppattaṃ vā anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇātī”ti? </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Sir, Ānanda, is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary?” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Atthi kho, gahapati, tena bhagavatā jānatā passatā arahatā sammāsambuddhena ekadhammo sammadakkhāto, yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati, aparikkhīṇā vā āsavā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, ananuppattaṃ vā anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇātī”ti. </span></p>
<p class="p3">“There is, householder.” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Katamo pana, bhante ānanda, tena bhagavatā jānatā passatā arahatā sammāsambuddhena ekadhammo sammadakkhāto, yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati, aparikkhīṇā vā āsavā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti, ananuppattaṃ vā anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇātī”ti? </span></p>
<p class="p3">“And what is that one thing?” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Idha, gahapati, bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Householder, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">So iti paṭisañcikkhati: </span></p>

<p class="p3">They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">So tattha ṭhito āsavānaṃ khayaṃ pāpuṇāti; </span></p>

<p class="p3">If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>

<p class="p3">Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. </p>
