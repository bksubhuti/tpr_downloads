<p class="p3"><span class="t4">4. Mahāvagga  - 4. The Great Chapter </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā mallesu viharati uruvelakappaṃ nāma mallānaṃ nigamo. </span></p>
<p class="p3">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town named Uruvelakappa. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho bhagavā pubbaṇhasamayaṃ nivāsetvā pattacīvaramādāya uruvelakappaṃ piṇḍāya pāvisi. </span></p>
<p class="p3">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Uruvelakappa for alms. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Uruvelakappe piṇḍāya caritvā pacchābhattaṃ piṇḍapātapaṭikkanto āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ āmantesi: </span></p>
<p class="p3">Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“idheva tāva tvaṃ, ānanda, hohi, yāvāhaṃ mahāvanaṃ ajjhogāhāmi divāvihārāyā”ti. </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Ānanda, you stay right here, while I plunge deep into the Great Wood for the day’s meditation.” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Evaṃ, bhante”ti kho āyasmā ānando bhagavato paccassosi. </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho bhagavā mahāvanaṃ ajjhogāhetvā aññatarasmiṃ rukkhamūle divāvihāraṃ nisīdi. </span></p>
<p class="p3">Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Great Wood and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho tapusso gahapati yenāyasmā ānando tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho tapusso gahapati āyasmantaṃ ānandaṃ etadavoca: </span></p>
<p class="p3">The householder Tapussa went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Mayaṃ, bhante ānanda, gihī kāmabhogino kāmārāmā kāmaratā kāmasammuditā. </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Sir, Ānanda, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures. We like sensual pleasures, we love them and take joy in them. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tesaṃ no, bhante, amhākaṃ gihīnaṃ kāmabhogīnaṃ kāmārāmānaṃ kāmaratānaṃ kāmasammuditānaṃ papāto viya khāyati, yadidaṃ nekkhammaṃ. </span></p>
<p class="p3">But renunciation seems like an abyss. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Sutaṃ metaṃ, bhante, ‘imasmiṃ dhammavinaye daharānaṃ daharānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ nekkhamme cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato’. </span></p>
<p class="p3">I have heard that in this teaching and training there are very young mendicants whose minds are eager for renunciation; they’re confident, settled, and decided about it. They see it as peaceful. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tayidaṃ, bhante, imasmiṃ dhammavinaye bhikkhūnaṃ bahunā janena visabhāgo, yadidaṃ nekkhamman”ti. </span></p>
<p class="p3">Renunciation is the dividing line between the multitude and the mendicants in this teaching and training.” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Atthi kho etaṃ, gahapati, kathāpābhataṃ bhagavantaṃ dassanāya. </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Householder, we should see the Buddha about this matter. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Āyāma, gahapati, yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamissāma; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocessāma. </span></p>
<p class="p3">Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Yathā no bhagavā byākarissati tathā naṃ dhāressāmā”ti. </span></p>
<p class="p3">As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Evaṃ, bhante”ti kho tapusso gahapati āyasmato ānandassa paccassosi. </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Yes, sir,” replied Tapussa. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Atha kho āyasmā ānando tapussena gahapatinā saddhiṃ yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā bhagavantaṃ abhivādetvā ekamantaṃ nisīdi. Ekamantaṃ nisinno kho āyasmā ānando bhagavantaṃ etadavoca: </span></p>
<p class="p3">Then Ānanda together with Tapussa went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Ānanda told him what had happened. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Ayaṃ, bhante, tapusso gahapati evamāha: </span></p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘mayaṃ, bhante ānanda, gihī kāmabhogino kāmārāmā kāmaratā kāmasammuditā, tesaṃ no, bhante, amhākaṃ gihīnaṃ kāmabhogīnaṃ kāmārāmānaṃ kāmaratānaṃ kāmasammuditānaṃ papāto viya khāyati, yadidaṃ nekkhammaṃ’. </span></p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Sutaṃ metaṃ, bhante, ‘imasmiṃ dhammavinaye daharānaṃ daharānaṃ bhikkhūnaṃ nekkhamme cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato. </span></p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tayidaṃ, bhante, imasmiṃ dhammavinaye bhikkhūnaṃ bahunā janena visabhāgo yadidaṃ nekkhamman’”ti. </span></p>
<p class="p3"> </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">“Evametaṃ, ānanda, evametaṃ, ānanda. </span></p>
<p class="p3">“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true! </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Mayhampi kho, ānanda, pubbeva sambodhā anabhisambuddhassa bodhisattasseva sato etadahosi: </span></p>
<p class="p3">Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘sādhu nekkhammaṃ, sādhu paviveko’ti. </span></p>
<p class="p3">‘Renunciation is good! Seclusion is good!’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, nekkhamme cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati na vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato. </span></p>
<p class="p3">But my mind wasn’t eager for renunciation; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi: </span></p>
<p class="p3">Then I thought, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘ko nu kho hetu ko paccayo, yena me nekkhamme cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati na vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato’? </span></p>
<p class="p3">‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t eager for renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi: </span></p>
<p class="p3">Then I thought, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘kāmesu kho me ādīnavo adiṭṭho, so ca me abahulīkato, nekkhamme ca ānisaṃso anadhigato, so ca me anāsevito. </span></p>
<p class="p3">‘I haven’t seen the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, and so I haven’t cultivated that. I haven’t realized the benefits of renunciation, and so I haven’t developed that. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tasmā me nekkhamme cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati na vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato’. </span></p>
<p class="p3">That’s why my mind isn’t eager for renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it. And it’s why I don’t see it as peaceful.’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi: </span></p>
<p class="p3">Then I thought, </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">‘sace kho ahaṃ kāmesu ādīnavaṃ disvā taṃ bahulaṃ kareyyaṃ, nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ adhigamma tamāseveyyaṃ, </span></p>
<p class="p3">‘Suppose that, seeing the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, realizing the benefits of renunciation, I were to develop that. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">ṭhānaṃ kho panetaṃ vijjati yaṃ me nekkhamme cittaṃ pakkhandeyya pasīdeyya santiṭṭheyya vimucceyya etaṃ santanti passato’. </span></p>
<p class="p3">It’s possible that my mind would be eager for renunciation; it would be confident, settled, and decided about it. And I would see it as peaceful.’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">So kho ahaṃ, ānanda, aparena samayena kāmesu ādīnavaṃ disvā taṃ bahulamakāsiṃ, nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ adhigamma tamāseviṃ. </span></p>
<p class="p3">And so, after some time, I saw the drawbacks of sensual pleasures and cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of renunciation and developed that. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, nekkhamme cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato. </span></p>
<p class="p3">Then my mind was eager for renunciation; it was confident, settled, and decided about it. I saw it as peaceful. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">So kho ahaṃ, ānanda, vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharāmi. </span></p>
<p class="p3">And so, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, iminā vihārena viharato kāmasahagatā saññāmanasikārā samudācaranti. Svassa me hoti ābādho. </span></p>
<p class="p3">While I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset me, and that was an affliction for me. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Seyyathāpi, ānanda, sukhino dukkhaṃ uppajjeyya yāvadeva ābādhāya; </span></p>
<p class="p3">Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">evamevassa me kāmasahagatā saññāmanasikārā samudācaranti. Svassa me hoti ābādho. </span></p>
<p class="p3">In the same way, when perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset me, that was an affliction for me. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, etadahosi: </span></p>
<p class="p3">Then I thought, </p>

<p class="p3">‘Why don’t I, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … enter and remain in the second absorption?’ </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t5">Tassa mayhaṃ, ānanda, avitakke cittaṃ na pakkhandati nappasīdati na santiṭṭhati na vimuccati etaṃ santanti passato. </span></p>
<p class="p3">But my mind wasn’t eager to stop placing the mind; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="t1"> </span></p>
