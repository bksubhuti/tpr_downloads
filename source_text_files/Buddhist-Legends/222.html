<p class="p8"><span class="t17">288-289. Sons are no refuge...</span></p>
<p class="p0"><span class="t12">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Paṭācārā.</p>
<p class="p0"><span class="t12">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p0">The story of Paṭācārā is contained in the Sahassa Vagga and is related in detail in the Commentary on Stanza</p>
<p class="p0"><span class="t12">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8">113. Though one should live a hundred years and never see the rise and set of beings, </p>
<p class="p8">Yet were it better far to live but a single day and see the rise and set of beings.<a id="a937"></a><a href="notes.html#a2144"><span class="t9">{449}</span></a></p>
<p class="p0"><span class="t12">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p0">Now at that time the Teacher, perceiving that the sorrow of Paṭācārā was assuaged, said to her, &ldquo;Paṭācārā, to one that goeth to the world beyond, nor sons nor father nor kinsfolk can ever be a refuge or a shelter or a retreat. Therefore, even though they live, they exist not. But he that is wise should clarify his virtue; so should he make clear the path that leads to Nibbāna.&rdquo; So saying, he preached the Law by pronouncing the following Stanzas,</p>
<p class="p0"><span class="t12">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">288. Sons are no refuge, nor a father, nor kinsfolk;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">There is no refuge in kinsfolk, for one who has been overtaken by Death. </span><span class="t16">[30.167]</span><span class="t17"> </span></p>
<p class="p0"><span class="t12">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">289. The man who is wise, who lives under the restraint of the moral law, understanding this power of circumstances,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Should quickly clear the path to Nibbāna. </span><span class="t16">{3.435}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">At the conclusion of the lesson Paṭācārā was established in the Fruit of Conversion; many others likewise obtained the Fruit of Conversion and the Fruits of the Second and Third Paths.</p>
