<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the ministers of justice. <span class="t10">{3.380}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">For on a certain day the monks made their rounds for alms in a settlement at the north gate of Sāvatthi, and returning from their pilgrimage to the monastery, passed through the center of the city. At that moment a cloud came up, and the rain began to fall. Entering a hall of justice opposite, they saw lords of justice taking bribes and depriving lawful owners of their property. Seeing this, they thought, &ldquo;Ah, these men are unrighteous! Until now we supposed they rendered righteous judgments.&rdquo; When the rain was over, they went to the monastery, saluted the Teacher, and sitting respectfully on one side, informed him of the incident. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Monks, they that yield to evil desires and decide a cause by violence, are not properly called justices; <span class="t10">{3.381}</span> they only that penetrate within a wrong and without violence render judgment according to the wrong committed, are properly called justices.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">256. Not therefore is a man called a justice because he decides a cause arbitrarily;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Nay rather is it he that inquires into both right and wrong, he that is wise.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">257. He that leads others without violence, justly and righteously,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">He that is protected of the Law, he that is intelligent, he alone is properly called a justice. </span></p>
