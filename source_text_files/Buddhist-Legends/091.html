<p class="p0"><span class="t23">Sāriputtattherassa mātulabrāhmaṇavatthu</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="t17">106. Though a man, month after month...</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to Elder Sāriputta&rsquo;s uncle. <span class="t10">{2.230}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The story goes that Elder Sāriputta once went to his uncle and said, &ldquo;Brahman, do you ever do a single good deed?&rdquo; &ldquo;I do, Reverend Sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Month after month, I give alms to the value of a thousand pieces of money.&rdquo; &ldquo;To whom do you give this money?&rdquo; &ldquo;To the Naked Ascetics, Reverend Sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what do you hope to gain thereby?&rdquo; &ldquo;I hope to gain the World of Brahmā.&rdquo; &ldquo;But is this the way to reach the World of Brahmā?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Reverend Sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who told you so?&rdquo; &ldquo;My teachers told me so, Reverend Sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Brahman, neither you nor your teachers know the way to the World of Brahmā. The Teacher alone knows the way thereto. Come with me, and I will ask him to tell you the way to the World of Brahmā.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">So Elder Sāriputta took his uncle with him, went to the Teacher, and told him all about it, saying, &ldquo;Reverend Sir, this Brahman said <span class="t10">[29.234]</span> so and so. Be so good as to tell him the way to the World of Brahmā.&rdquo; The Teacher asked, &ldquo;Brahman, are you correctly reported?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Sir Gotama.&rdquo; &ldquo;Brahman, though you should give alms in this way for a hundred years, <span class="t10">{2.231}</span> yet were it far more fruitful for a man, with believing heart, for but a single instant to look upon my disciple or to bestow upon him a mere spoonful of boiled rice.&rdquo; So saying, he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">106. Though a man, month after month, for a hundred years, should sacrifice a thousand pieces of money,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Yet, should he honor for even a single instant a man who has trained himself,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">It were better for him so to render honor than to offer sacrifice for a hundred years. </span></p>
