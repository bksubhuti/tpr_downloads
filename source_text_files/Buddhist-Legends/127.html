<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a company of over-confident monks. <span class="t10">{3.111}</span></p>
<p class="p0"><span class="t12">&nbsp;</span></p>

At that moment they realized that the Depravities still existed within them. Thereupon the Teacher, still remaining seated in the Perfumed Chamber, sent forth a luminous image of himself, and as it were spoke face to face with those monks, saying, &ldquo;Monks, is it fitting that upon beholding such an assemblage of bones you should take pleasure in the evil passions?&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Are these gray bones; what pleasure can there be in looking at them? </span></p>
