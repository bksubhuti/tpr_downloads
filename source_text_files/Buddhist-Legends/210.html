<p class="p8"><span class="t17">271-272. Not merely because of religious practices...</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to several virtuous monks. <span class="t10">{3.398}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The story goes that some of these monks considered thus within themselves, &ldquo;We have acquired virtue; we have taken upon ourselves the Pure Practices; we are exceedingly learned; we dwell in places of abode that are solitary and remote; we have developed the Supernatural Powers by Ecstatic Meditation. For us it would be no hard matter to attain Arahatship; indeed we can attain Arahatship any day we wish.&rdquo; Likewise those of the monks who had attained the Fruit of the Third Path, considered thus within themselves, &ldquo;For us it would be no hard matter now to attain Arahatship.&rdquo; One day all of them <span class="t10">{3.399}</span> approached the Teacher, saluted him, and seated themselves respectfully on one side.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The Teacher asked them, &ldquo;But, monks, have you brought your religious duties to consummation?&rdquo; The monks replied, &ldquo;Reverend Sir, we have attained such and such degrees of sanctity. Therefore, whenever we wish, we are able to attain Arahatship. With this thought in our minds, we keep residence.&rdquo; When the Teacher heard <span class="t10">[30.148]</span> their reply, he said, &ldquo;Monks, it is never proper for a monk, merely because he has kept the precepts whole and undefiled, or because he has attained the bliss of the Third Path, to think, &lsquo;But little suffering is involved in our present existence.&rsquo; On the contrary, not until he has attained Destruction of the Depravities, should he allow himself to think, &lsquo;I have attained true bliss&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">271. Not merely because of religious practices, nor yet because of much learning,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Neither because of attainment of Tranquillity, nor because of living solitary and remote,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">272. Win I the Bliss of Release, incapable of attainment by worldlings.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Monk, rest not content until thou hast attained Destruction of the Depravities.</span></p>
