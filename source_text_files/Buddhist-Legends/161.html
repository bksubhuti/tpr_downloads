<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a question asked by the Elder Ānanda.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">One day as the Elder sat in his day-quarters, he thought to himself, <span class="t10">{3.248}</span> &ldquo;The Teacher has told us whence come well-bred elephants, horses, and bullocks. &lsquo;Noble elephants,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;are bred from the stock of Chaddanta or of Uposatha;<a id="a721"></a><a href="notes.html#a1980"><span class="t9">{367}</span></a> noble chargers from the stock of Valāhaka, king of horses; and noble bullocks are raised in the Dekkan.&rsquo; But <span class="t8">men</span> of noble birth, &ndash; now whence pray come they?&rdquo; He went to the Teacher, saluted him, and asked him about the matter. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Ānanda, your &lsquo;men of noble birth&rsquo;, &ndash; it is not everywhere that they are born. But in the Middle Country, three hundred leagues long in a straight line and nine hundred in a circuit, &ndash; there they are born. But when they are born, it is not in any family soever that they are born, but only in a family here and there of some Khattiya or Brahman noble.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">193. It is not easy to find a man of noble birth; it is not everywhere that such a man is born;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Wherever is born a man that is steadfast, the family prospers wherein he is born. </span></p>
