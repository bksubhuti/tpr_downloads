<p class="p8"><span class="t17">104. Victory over self is better...</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a Brahman who asked about gain and loss. <span class="t10">{2.227}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The story goes that this Brahman considered within himself, &ldquo;Does the Supremely Enlightened know gain alone or does he know loss also? I will ask him.&rdquo; Accordingly he approached the Teacher and asked him, &ldquo;Reverend Sir, tell me, I pray you, do you know gain alone, and not loss?&rdquo; &ldquo;Brahman, I know both gain and loss.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then, tell me about loss.&rdquo; At once the Teacher pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8">Unprofitable is sleeping after sunrise, idleness, the moonlight, long-continued prosperity,</p>
<p class="p8">Going on journeys, seeking after other men&rsquo;s wives.</p>
<p class="p8">Seek after these things, Brahman, and you will gain that which will be of no advantage to you. <span class="t10">[29.233]</span> </p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">When the Brahman heard this, he applauded the Teacher, saying, &ldquo;Well said, well said, teacher of the multitude, leader of the multitude! You know indeed both gain and loss.&rdquo; <span class="t10">{2.228}</span> &ldquo;Indeed, Brahman, there is none other that knows loss so well as I.&rdquo; Then the Teacher considered within himself what motive actuated the Brahman, and asked him, &ldquo;Brahman, how do you make your living?&rdquo; &ldquo;By gambling, Sir Gotama.&rdquo; &ldquo;But which wins, you or the other man?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sometimes I win and sometimes the other man wins.&rdquo; Then said the Teacher, &ldquo;Brahman, a trifling matter is the victory of him who defeats another; there is no superior advantage in such a victory. But he who overcomes his Depravities and so conquers self, wins a better victory, for such a victory no one can turn into defeat.&rdquo; So saying, he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, pronounced the following Stanzas,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">104. Victory over self is better than victory over all other folk besides;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">If a man conquer self, and live always under restraint,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">105. Neither god nor gandhabba nor Māra with Brahmā united,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Can turn into defeat the victory of such a man. </span></p>
