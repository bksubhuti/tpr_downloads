<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to an Elder named Fault-finder, Ujjhānasaññī. <span class="t10">{3.376}</span></p>

<p class="p0">The story goes that this Elder used to go about finding fault with the monks, saying, &ldquo;Thus does this monk put on his undergarment, thus does he put on his upper garment.&rdquo; The monks reported the matter to the Teacher, saying, &ldquo;Reverend Sir, Elder So-and-so is doing thus and so.&rdquo; The Teacher replied, &ldquo;Monks, he who attends strictly to whatever comes under the head of duty and admonishes others to do likewise, the same is not a faultfinder. But he who is minded to find fault, who seeks to find flaws in others, and who goes about talking accordingly, such a man will never attain a single one of the Specific Attainments such as Trance; only the Impurities increase within him.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="t17">The Impurities increase within him; such a man is far from Destruction of the Impurities. </span></p>
