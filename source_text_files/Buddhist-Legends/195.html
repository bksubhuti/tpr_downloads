<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to five hundred lay disciples. <span class="t10">{3.355}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">For of these five hundred lay disciples, one kept only the precept of abstinence from the taking of life; another, another precept, and so on. One day they fell into a dispute, each of them saying, &ldquo;It is a hard thing I have to do; it is a hard precept I have to keep.&rdquo; And going to the Teacher, they saluted him and referred the whole matter to him. The Teacher listened to what they had to say, and then, without naming a single precept as of lesser importance, said, &ldquo;All of the precepts are hard to keep.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">246. He that destroys life, he that utters falsehood,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">He that takes what is not given to him in this world, he that goes in unto another man&rsquo;s wife, </span><span class="t16">{3.356}</span><span class="t17"> </span><span class="t16">[30.126]</span></p>

<p class="p8"><span class="t17">247. And the man that is addicted to the drinking of liquor and spirits,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Such a man, even in this present world, digs up his own root.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">248. Know this, O man, that the unrestrained are fallen upon evil ways; </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Let not greed and wrongdoing subject thee to suffering for long. </span></p>
