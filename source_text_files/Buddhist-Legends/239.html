<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Naked Ascetics of the Jain Order, Nigaṇṭhas. <span class="t10">{3.489}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">For one day the monks, seeing Naked Ascetics of the Jain Order, began the following discussion: &ldquo;Brethren, these Nigaṇṭhas are to be preferred to the Acelakas, who go entirely naked, for these ascetics at least wear a covering in front. These ascetics evidently possess some sense of modesty.&rdquo; Overhearing the discussion, the Nigaṇṭhas said, &ldquo;It is not for this reason at all that we wear a covering. <span class="t10">{3.490}</span> On the contrary, even dust and dirt are actual individuals, endowed with the principle of life; and so, &ndash; for fear they may fall into our alms-dishes, &ndash; for this reason we wear a covering.&rdquo; Arguments and counter-arguments followed between both parties of monks, and there was a long discussion. Afterwards the monks approached the Teacher, and having sat down, told him of the incident. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Monks, they that feel shame when they ought not to feel shame, and they that do not feel shame when they ought to feel shame, go to an evil future state.&rdquo; So saying, he preached the Law by pronouncing the following Stanzas, <span class="t10">[30.197]</span> </p>
