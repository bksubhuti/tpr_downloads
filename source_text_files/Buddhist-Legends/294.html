<p class="p8"><span class="t17">405. He that has laid aside the rod...</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain monk. <span class="t10">{4.174}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">It appears that this monk, upon receiving a Subject of Meditation from the Teacher, retired to the forest, applied himself diligently to the practice of meditation, and attained Arahatship. Thereupon he said to himself, &ldquo;I will inform the Teacher of the great blessing which I have received,&rdquo; and set out from the forest. Now a woman living in a certain village through which he passed, had just had a quarrel with her husband, and as soon as her husband was out of the house, said to <span class="t10">[30.296]</span> herself, &ldquo;I will return to the house of my family.&rdquo; So saying, she set out on the road. As she went along the road, she saw the Elder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep not far from this Elder,&rdquo; thought she, and followed close behind him. The Elder never looked at her at all.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">When her husband returned home and saw his wife nowhere about the house, he concluded to himself, &ldquo;She must have gone to the village where her family lives,&rdquo; and followed after her. When he saw her, he thought to himself, &ldquo;It cannot be that this woman would enter this forest all by herself; in whose company is she going?&rdquo; All of a sudden he saw the Elder. <span class="t10">{4.175}</span> Thought he, &ldquo;This monk must have taken her away with him,&rdquo; and went up to the monk and threatened him. Said the woman, &ldquo;This good monk never so much as looked at me or spoke to me; do not say anything to him.&rdquo; Her husband replied, &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that you took yourself off in this fashion? I will treat him as you alone deserve to be treated.&rdquo; And in a burst of rage, out of hatred for the woman, he beat the Elder soundly, and having so done, took the woman with him and returned home.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The Elder&rsquo;s whole body was covered with weals. After his return to the monastery the monks who rubbed his body noticed the weals and asked him, &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; He told them the whole story. Then the monks asked him, &ldquo;Brother, but when this fellow struck you thus, what did you say? or did you get angry?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, brethren, I did not get angry.&rdquo; Thereupon the monks went to the Teacher and reported the matter to him, saying, &ldquo;Reverend Sir, when we asked this monk, &lsquo;Did you get angry?&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;No, brethren, I did not get angry.&rsquo; He does not speak the truth, he utters falsehood.&rdquo; The Teacher listened to what they had to say and then replied, &ldquo;Monks, they that have rid themselves of the evil passions have laid aside the rod; even for those that strike them, they cherish no anger.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">405. He that has laid aside the rod, and inflicts not punishment on living beings, whether animate or inanimate,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">He that kills not nor causes to kill, such a man I call a Brahman. </span></p>
