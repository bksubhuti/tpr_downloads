<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the nun Uppalavaṇṇā. <span class="t10">{4.166}</span> The story has been related at length in the Commentary on the Stanza beginning with the words, &ldquo;As sweet as honey thinks a fool an evil deed.&rdquo; For it is there said:</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">Some time later, the throng in the Hall of Truth began the following discussion: &ldquo;To be sure those that have rid themselves of the Depravities gratify their passions. Why should they not? For they are not kolāpa-trees or ant-hills, but are living creatures with bodies of moist flesh. Therefore they also like the pleasures of love.&rdquo; At that moment the Teacher drew near. &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;what is the subject that engages your attention now as you sit here all gathered together?&rdquo; &ldquo;Such and such,&rdquo; was the reply. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;No, <span class="t10">[30.291]</span> monks, they that have rid themselves of the Depravities neither like the pleasures of love nor gratify their passions. For even as a drop of water which has fallen upon a lotus-leaf does not cling thereto or remain thereon, but rolls over and falls off, even as a grain of mustard-seed does not cling to the point of an awl or remain thereon, but rolls over and falls off, <span class="t10">{4.167}</span> precisely so twofold love clings not to the heart of one that has rid himself of the Depravities or remain there.&rdquo; And joining the connection, he preached the Law, pronouncing the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">401. Even as water does not cling to a lotus-leaf, nor a grain of mustard-seed to the point of an awl,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Whoso in like manner clings not to the pleasures of sense, him I call a Brahman. </span></p>
