<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain Brahman. <span class="t10">{4.158}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The story goes that this Brahman one day said to himself, &ldquo;The monk Gotama calls his own disciples &lsquo;Brahmans.&rsquo; Now I was reborn in the womb of a Brahman mother; therefore he ought to apply this title to me too.&rdquo; So he approached the Teacher and asked him about the matter. Said the Teacher to the Brahman, &ldquo;I do not call a man a Brahman merely because he received a new existence in the womb of a Brahman mother. But he that is without worldly possessions, he that grasps not after the things of this world, him alone I call a Brahman.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">396. I call not a man a Brahman for that he has issued from the womb of a Brahman mother or sprung from a Brahman mother.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Such a man addresses me as &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; such a man has worldly possessions.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">But he that is without worldly possessions, he that seeks not the things of this world, him alone I call a Brahman. </span></p>
