<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Kisā Gotamī. <span class="t10">{3.432}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The Story of Kisā Gotamī is contained in the Sahassa Vagga, and is related in detail in the Commentary on Stanza</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8">114. Though one should live a hundred years, the Region of the Deathless never seeing,</p>
<p class="p8">Yet were it better far to live a single day, the Region of the Deathless seeing.&rsquo;<a id="a933"></a><a href="notes.html#a2140"><span class="t9">{447}</span></a> <span class="t10">[30.166]</span> </p>

<p class="p0">For at that time the Teacher said, &ldquo;Kisā Gotamī, didst thou get the pinch of white mustard-seed?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay, Reverend Sir, that did I not. In the entire village the dead are more in number than the living.&rdquo; Then said the Teacher, &ldquo;Vainly didst thou imagine that thou alone hadst lost a child. But this is an eternal law for all beings. For the Prince of Death, like to a raging torrent, drags along and flings into the sea of ruin all living beings; still are their longings unfulfilled.&rdquo; So saying, he preached the Law by pronouncing the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">287. If a man be passionately devoted to sons or flocks and herds, if his mind be completely absorbed therein,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">The Prince of Death will take and bear him away, even as a raging torrent sweeps away a sleeping village. </span><span class="t16">{3.433}</span></p>
<p class="p0"><span class="t12">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p0">At the conclusion of the lesson Kisā Gotamī was established in the Fruit of Conversion; the assembled company also profited by the lesson. </p>
