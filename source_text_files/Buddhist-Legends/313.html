<p class="p0">The King of Righteousness attained the Dhammapada, the Incomparable [Nibbāna]. That Mighty Sage uttered the Stanzas of the Dhammapada.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">Revealing the Four Truths, he uttered Stanzas four hundred three and twenty in number. There came into existence three hundred Stories less one.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">Residing with grateful heart in the monastery erected by the monarch, in the palace of King Sirikūṭa,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">I composed, in a series consisting of seventy-two portions for recitation, this faultless Commentary on the Stanzas,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">In accordance with the spirit and letter of the Stanzas, based on the Good Law of the Protector of the World, for the weal and welfare of mankind.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">By the merit which I earned thereby, may all the good desires of all living beings be fulfilled, producing sweet fruit.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">Prosperity! Happiness! Health!</p>
