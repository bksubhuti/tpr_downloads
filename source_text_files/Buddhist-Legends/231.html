<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a monk named Elder Solitary.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">It appears that this Elder was known to the fourfold community as one who sat alone and walked alone and stood alone. Now the <span class="t10">[30.188]</span> monks told the Tathāgata about him, saying, &ldquo;Reverend Sir, such and such is the practice of this Elder.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well done! well done!&rdquo; exclaimed the Teacher, <span class="t10">{3.472}</span> applauding him. &ldquo;He that is a monk ought to live as a solitary.&rdquo; And praising the life of solitude, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">305. He who sits alone, lodges alone, and walks alone, unwearied,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">He who, alone, subdues himself, such a man will delight in the outskirts of the forest.</span></p>
