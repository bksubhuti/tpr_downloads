<p class="p0">The story goes that this nun continued her alms-pilgrimages until she was a hundred and twenty years old. One day as she was returning from her alms-pilgrimage with food in her bowl, she met a certain monk in the street. She asked permission of him to give him the food in her bowl, and he consented to accept it. So she gave him all she had, and then she had none. On the second day and again on the third day she met the same monk in the same place, gave him all the food she had, and then had none left for herself.</p>

The Teacher came up to her and said, &ldquo;Sister, your body is worn out with old age; at a time not far distant it will suffer dissolution.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>

<p class="p8"><span class="t17">This mass of corruption dissolves; for life ends in death. </span></p>
