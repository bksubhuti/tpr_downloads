<p class="p8"><span class="t17">262-263. Not through eloquence...</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a company of monks. <span class="t10">{3.388}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">For once upon a time certain Elders saw some young monks and novices dyeing robes and performing the other duties for their preceptors. Thereupon they said to themselves, &ldquo;We ourselves are clever at putting words together, but for all that, receive no such attentions. Suppose <span class="t10">{3.389}</span> now we were to approach the Teacher and say to him, &lsquo;Reverend Sir, when it comes to the letter of the Sacred Word, we too are expert; give orders to the young monks and novices as follows, &ldquo;Even though you have learned the Law from others, do not rehearse it until you have improved your acquaintance with it under these Elders.&rdquo;&rsquo; Thus will our gain and honor increase.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">Accordingly they approached the Teacher and said to him what they had agreed upon. The Teacher listened to what they had to say and became aware of the following, &ldquo;In this Religion, according to tradition, it is entirely proper to say just this. However, these Elders seek only their own gain.&rdquo; So he said to them, &ldquo;I do not consider you &lsquo;accomplished&rsquo; merely because of your ability to talk. But that man in whom envy and other evil qualities have been <span class="t10">[30.144]</span> uprooted by the Path of Arahatship, he alone is truly accomplished.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">262. Not through eloquence or beauty of complexion</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Is a man accomplished, if at the same time he be envious, niggardly, deceitful.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">263. But he that has cut off and uprooted and removed all these faults,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">He that has rid himself of hatred, he that is intelligent, such a man is rightly called accomplished. </span></p>
