<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the householder Citta. <span class="t10">{3.464}</span></p>

<p class="p0">This story has been related in detail in the Bāla Vagga in the Commentary on the Stanza beginning, &ldquo;The fool will seek for false reputation.&rdquo;<a id="a964"></a><a href="notes.html#a2166"><span class="t9">{460}</span></a> The Stanza likewise occurs there. For it is there said:</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">&ldquo;Now, Reverend Sir, was it solely because he came to visit you, that he received all this honor? Or would he also have received it had he gone elsewhere?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ānanda, he would have received it just the same, no matter whether he had come to visit me or had gone elsewhere. For this disciple is faithful and believing and virtuous. Such a disciple as this may go to what place he will, and there, no matter where it may be, will receive gain and honor.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">303. If a man be faithful, endued with virtue, possessed of fame and wealth,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">He may go to what place he will, and there, wherever it may be, he is honored. </span></p>
