<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain Brahman who wore matted locks. <span class="t10">{4.152}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The story goes that this Brahman said one day to himself, &ldquo;I am well born on my mother&rsquo;s side and on my father&rsquo;s side, for I was <span class="t10">[30.283]</span> reborn in the family of a Brahman. Now the monk Gotama calls his own disciples &lsquo;Brahmans.&rsquo; He ought to apply the same title to me too.&rdquo; So the Brahman went to the Teacher and asked him about the matter. Said the Teacher to the Brahman, &ldquo;Brahman, I do not call a man a Brahman merely because he wears matted locks, merely because of his birth and lineage. But he that has penetrated the truth, him alone do I call a &lsquo;Brahman.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">393. It is not matted locks or lineage or birth that makes a Brahman;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">But he in whom Truth exists, and the Law, he is blessed, he is a Brahman. </span></p>
