<p class="p8"><span class="t17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p0">Sāriputta and Moggallāna went there and admonished and instructed those monks. Some of them received the admonitions of the Elders and corrected their behavior, others returned to the house-life, while still others were expelled from the Order. </p>
