<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain Brahman. <span class="t10">{3.392}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The story goes that this Brahman retired from the world and became a monk of an heretical order. As he went about on his rounds for alms, he thought to himself, &ldquo;The monk Gotama addresses as &ldquo;monks&rdquo; his own disciples who go about on rounds for alms; he ought to address me also as a monk.&rdquo; Accordingly he approached the Teacher and said to him, &ldquo;Sir Gotama, I also support life by going about on rounds for alms; address me also as a monk.&rdquo; But the Teacher said to him, &ldquo;Brahman, I do not call a man a monk merely because he receives alms. For a man who adopts and practices all the forms is not therefore a monk. But he that weighs well all the Aggregates of Being and acts accordingly, he is a monk indeed.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanzas,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">266. Not therefore is a man a monk because he receives alms from others.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">He that adopts the religion, forms and all, is not on that account a monk.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">267. Whoever in this world casts out both merit and demerit, lives a life of chastity,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Walks wisely through the world, he is a monk indeed. </span></p>
