<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the king of Kosala, learning of the low birth of his queen, rejected her, and her son. The Buddha convinces him otherwise, and tells a story of the past where he had been born of a king and claimed his rightful place at court.</span></p>

Tradition tells us that she was the daughter of Mahānāma Sakka by a slave girl named Nāgamuṇḍā, and that she afterwards became the consort of the king of Kosala. She conceived a son by the king; but the king, coming to know of her servile origin, degraded her from her rank, and also degraded her son Viḍūḍabha. Mother and son never came outside the palace.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Hearing of this, the Teacher at early dawn came to the palace attended by five hundred monks, </span><span class="t18">{1.134}</span><span class="t30"> and, sitting down on the seat prepared for him, said: &ldquo;Sire, where is Vāsabhakhattiyā?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the king told him what had happened.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Sire, whose daughter is Vāsabhakhattiyā?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mahānāma&rsquo;s daughter, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;When she came away, to whom did she come as wife?&rdquo; &ldquo;To me, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, she is a king&rsquo;s daughter; to a king she is wed; and to a king she bore her </span><a id="a995"></a><span class="t18">[1.28]</span><a id="a996"></a><span class="t30"> son. Wherefore is that son not in authority over the realm which owns his father&rsquo;s sway? In bygone days, a monarch who had a son by a casual</span><a id="a997"></a><a href="notes.html#a14663"><span class="t9">{215}</span></a><span class="t30"> faggot-gatherer gave that son his sovereignty.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The king asked the Fortunate One to explain this. The Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed from him by rebirth.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past in Benares Brahmadatta the king, having gone in great state to his pleasure gardens, was roaming about looking for fruits and flowers when he came on a woman who was merrily singing away as she picked up sticks in the grove. Falling in love at first sight, the king became intimate with her, and the Bodhisatta was conceived then and there. Feeling as heavy within as though weighed down with the bolt of Sakka, the woman knew that she would become a mother, and told the king so. He gave her the signet-ring from his finger and dismissed her with these words, &ldquo;If it be a girl, spend this ring on her nurture; but if it be a boy, bring ring and child to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">When the woman&rsquo;s time was come, she bore the Bodhisatta. And when he could run about and was playing in the playground, a cry would arise, &ldquo;No-father has hit me!&rdquo; Hearing this, the Bodhisatta ran away to his mother and asked who his father was.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;You are the son of the king of Benares, my boy.&rdquo; &ldquo;What proof of this is there, mother?&rdquo; &ldquo;My son, the king on leaving me gave me this signet-ring and said, &lsquo;If it be a girl, spend this ring on her nurture; but if it be a boy, bring ring and child to me.&rsquo; &rdquo; &ldquo;Why then don&rsquo;t you take me to my father, mother?&rdquo;<span class="t18"> {1.135}</span></p>
<p class="p7">Seeing that the boy&rsquo;s mind was made up, she took him to the gate of the palace, and bade their coming be announced to the king. Being summoned in, she entered and bowing before his majesty said: &ldquo;This is your son, sire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king knew well enough that this was the truth, but shame before all his court made him reply, &ldquo;He is no son of mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;But here is your signet-ring, sire; you will recognise that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nor is this my signet-ring.&rdquo; Then said the woman, &ldquo;Sire, I have now no witness to prove my words, except to appeal to truth. Wherefore, if you be the father of my child, I pray that he may stay in mid-air; but if not, may he fall to earth and be killed.&rdquo; So saying, she seized the Bodhisatta by the foot and threw him up into the air.<a id="a998"></a><span class="t18"> [1.29]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Seated cross-legged in mid-air, the Bodhisatta in sweet tones repeated this verse to his father, declaring the truth:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Putto tyāhaṁ mahārāja, tvaṁ maṁ posa janādhipa,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Aññe pi devo poseti, kiñ-ca devo sakaṁ pajan-ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">I am your son, great king, you must support me, leader of men, the king supports others, so why not his own son?</span></p>
<p class="p23">Hearing the Bodhisatta thus teach the truth to him from mid-air, the king stretched out his hands and cried, &ldquo;Come to me, my boy! None, none but me shall rear and nurture you!&rdquo; A thousand hands were stretched out to receive the Bodhisatta; <span class="t18">{1.136}</span> but it was into the arms of the king and of no other that he descended, seating himself in the king&rsquo;s lap. The king made him viceroy, and made his mother queen-consort. At the death of the king his father, he came to the throne by the title of king Kaṭṭhavāhana &ndash; the faggot-bearer &ndash; and after ruling his realm righteously, passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson to the king of Kosala ended, and his two stories told, the Teacher made the connection linking them both together, and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Mahāmāyā was the mother of those days, king Suddhodana was the father, and I myself king Kaṭṭhavāhana.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;By proceeding steadily.&rdquo;</span><a id="a1008"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about a monk who gave up persevering. In this Jātaka both the Story of the Present and the Story of the Past will be given in the Eleventh Book in connection with the Saṁvarajātaka [Ja 462];</span><a id="a1009"></a><a href="notes.html#a14665"><span class="t9">{216}</span></a><span class="t30"> the incidents are the same both for that Jātaka and for this, but the verses are different.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1010"></a><a id="a1011"></a><span class="t34">This, we learn, was a young man of family, who lived in Sāvatthi. Having heard the Teacher&rsquo;s discoursing, he renounced the world. Fulfilling the tasks imposed by his teachers and preceptors, he learned by heart both the Pātimokkhas.</span><a id="a1012"></a><a href="notes.html#a14667"><span class="t24">{217}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When five years were past, he said: &ldquo;When I have been instructed in the mode of attaining Absorption, I will go dwell in the forest.&rdquo; Then he took leave of his teachers and preceptors, and proceeded to a frontier village in the kingdom of Kosala. The people were pleased with his behaviour, and he made a hut of leaves and there was attended to.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Entering upon the rainy season, zealous, eager, striving in strenuous endeavour he strove after Absorption for the space of three months: but of this not a trace could he produce. Then he thought: &ldquo;Verily I am the most devoted to worldly conditions among the four classes of men taught by the Teacher! What have I to do with living in the forest?&rdquo; Then he said to himself, &ldquo;I will return to Jetavana, and there in beholding the beauty of the Tathāgata, and hearing his discourse sweet as honey, I will pass my days.&rdquo; So he relaxed his striving; and setting forth he came in course of time to Jetavana. His preceptors and teachers, his friends and acquaintances asked him the cause of his coming. He informed them, and they reproved him for it, asking him why he had done so.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then they led him into the Teacher&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Why, monks,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;do you lead here a monk against his will?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;This monk has come here because he has relaxed his striving.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is this true, as they tell me?&rdquo; asked the Teacher. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the man. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Why have you ceased to strive, monk? For a weak and slothful man there is in this dispensation no high fruition, no becoming an Arahat: they only who make strenuous effort accomplish this. In days long gone by you were full of strength, easy to teach: and in this way, though the youngest of all the hundred sons of the king of Benares, by holding fast to the admonition of wise men you obtained the white umbrella.&rdquo; So saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the youngest of his hundred sons was named prince Gāmani. The king gave his sons in charge each of a separate courtier, with directions to teach them each what they ought to learn. The courtier who instructed the prince Gāmani was the Bodhisatta, wise, learned, filling a father&rsquo;s place to the king&rsquo;s son. As each of the sons was educated, the courtiers brought them for the king to see. The king gave them each a province, and let them go.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">When the prince Gāmani had been perfected in all learning, he asked the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Dear father, if my father sends me to a province, what am I to do?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;My son, when a province is offered you, you should refuse it, and say, My lord, I am the youngest of all: if I go too, there will be no one about your feet: I will remain where I am, at your feet.&rdquo; Then one day, when prince Gāmani had saluted him, and was standing on one side, the king asked him, &ldquo;Well, my son, have you finished your learning?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Choose a province.&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, there will be emptiness about your feet: let me remain here at your feet, and in no other place!&rdquo; The king was pleased, and consented.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">After that he remained there at the king&rsquo;s feet; and again asked the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;What else am I to do, father?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ask the king,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for some old park.&rdquo; The prince complied, and asked for a park: with the fruits and flowers that there grew he made friends with the powerful men in the city. Again he asked what he was to do. &ldquo;Ask the king&rsquo;s leave, my son,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;to distribute the food-money within the city.&rdquo; So he did, and without the least neglect of any person he distributed the food-money within the city. Again he asked the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s advice, and after soliciting the king&rsquo;s consent, distributed food within the palace to the servitors and the horses and to the army, without any omission: to messengers come from foreign countries he assigned their lodging and so forth, for merchants he fixed the taxes, all that had to be arranged he did alone. Thus following the advice of the Great Being, he made friends with everybody, those in the household and those without, all in the city, the subjects of the kingdom, strangers, by his winsomeness binding them to him as it were by a band of iron: to all of them he was dear and beloved.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">When in due time the king lay on his deathbed, the courtiers asked him, &ldquo;When you are dead, my lord, to whom shall we give the white umbrella?&rdquo; &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;all my sons have a right to the white umbrella. But you may give it to him that pleases your mind.&rdquo; So after his death, and when the obsequies had been performed, on the seventh day they gathered together, and said: &ldquo;Our king bade us give the Umbrella to him that pleases our mind. He that our mind desires is prince Gāmani.&rdquo; Over him therefore they uplifted the white umbrella with its festoons of gold, escorted by his kinsmen.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The Great king Gāmani cleaving to the advice of the Bodhisatta reigned in righteousness.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The other ninety nine princes heard that their father was dead, and that the Umbrella had been uplifted over Gāmani. &ldquo;But he is the youngest of all,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;the Umbrella does not belong to him. Let us uplift the Umbrella over the eldest of us all.&rdquo; They all joined forces, and sent a letter to Gāmani, bidding him resign the Umbrella or fight; then they surrounded the city. The king told this news to the Bodhisatta, and asked what he was to do now. He answered, &ldquo;Great king, you must not fight with your brothers. Divide the treasure belonging to your father into a hundred portions, and to your brothers send ninety-nine of them, with this message, &ldquo;Accept this share of your father&rsquo;s treasure, for fight with you I will not.&rdquo; So he did.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Then the eldest of all the brothers, prince Uposatha by name, summoned the rest together, and said to them, &ldquo;Friends, there is no one able to overcome the king; and this our youngest brother, though he has been our enemy, does not remain so: but he sends us his wealth, and refuses to</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t11">fight with us. Now we cannot all uplift the Umbrella at the same moment; let us uplift it over one only, and let him alone be king; so when we see him, we will hand over the royal treasure to him, and return to our own provinces.&rdquo; Then all these princes raised the siege of the city, and entered it, foes no longer. And the king told his courtiers to welcome them, and sent them to meet the princes. The princes with a great following entered on foot, and mounting the steps of the palace, and using all humility towards the great king Gāmani, sat down in a lowly place. King Gāmani was seated under the white umbrella upon a throne: great magnificence was his, and great pomp; what place soever he looked upon, trembled and quaked. Prince Uposatha seeing the magnificence of the mighty king Gāmani, thought to himself, &ldquo;Our father, I think, knew that prince Gāmani would be king after his decease, and therefore gave us provinces and gave him none,&rdquo; then addressing him, repeated three verses:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Your nature, mighty monarch, sure the lord of men well knew:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">The other princes honoured he, but nothing gave to you.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">While the king lived was it, or when a god to heaven he went,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">That seeing their own benefit, your kinsmen gave consent?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Say by what power, O Gāmani, you stand above your kin:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Why do your brothers not unite from you the place to win?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">On hearing this, king Gāmani repeated six verses to explain his own character:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Because, O prince, I never grudge great sages what is meet:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Ready to pay them honour due, I fall before their feet.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Me envying none, and apt to learn all conduct meet and right,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Wise sages each good precept teach in which they take delight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">I listen to the bidding of these sages great and wise:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">My heart is bent to good intent, no counsel I despise.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Elephant troops and chariotmen, guard royal, infantry &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">I took no toll of daily dole, but paid them all their fee.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Great nobles and wise counsellors waiting on me are found;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">With food, wine, water (so they boast) Benares does abound.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Thus merchants prosper, and from many a realm they come and go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">And I protect them. Now the truth, Uposatha, you know.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Prince Uposatha listened to this account of his character, and then repeated two verses:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Then be above your kith and kin, and rule in righteousness,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">So wise and prudent, Gāmani, your brothers you shall bless.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Your treasure-heaps your brothers will defend, and you shall be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a1013"></a><span class="t25">Safe from your foes as Sakka&rsquo;s self from his arch enemy.</span><a id="a1014"></a><a href="notes.html#a14669"><span class="t36">{218}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a1015"></a>Abiding steadfast in the counsels of the Bodhisatta, prince Gāmani, finding himself &ndash; though the youngest of a hundred brothers &ndash; surrounded by those hundred brothers as a retinue and seated beneath the white canopy of kingship, <a id="a1016"></a><span class="t18">[1.30]</span> contemplated his glory and thought: &ldquo;All this glory I owe to my teacher.&rdquo; And, in his joy, he burst into this exalted utterance:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Api ataramānānaṁ phalāsā va samijjhati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vipakkabrahmacariyosmi, evaṁ jānāhi Gāmaṇī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">By proceeding steadily the one who desires the fruit succeeds, I have the fruit of the spiritual life, know this, Gāmaṇi. </span><span class="t18">{1.137}</span></p>
<p class="p23">Seven or eight days after he had become king, all his brothers departed to their own homes. King Gāmani, after ruling his kingdom in righteousness, passed away to fare according to his deeds. The Bodhisatta also passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Truths, at the close whereof the faint-hearted monk became an Arahat. Having told the two stories, the Teacher showed the connection linking them both together and identified the Jātaka.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a1032"></a><a id="a1033"></a><span class="t34">...the future Buddha, making light of the kingdom of the world, thus within his reach &ndash; casting it away as one would saliva &ndash; left the city with great honour on the full-moon day of Āsāḷhi, when the moon was in the Uttarāsāḷha lunar mansion (i.e. on the [last day of the lunar month in] July)..</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">For then, they say, Devas in front of him carried sixty thousand torches, and behind him too, and on his right hand, and on his left..</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Advancing in this pomp and glory, the Bodhisatta, in that one night, passed beyond three kingdoms, and arrived, at the end of thirty leagues, at the bank of the river called Anomā..</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now the Bodhisatta, stopping at the river side, asked Channa, &ldquo;What is this river called?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Its name, my lord, is Anomā.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;And so also our renunciation of the world shall be called Anomā (Illustrious),&rdquo; said he; and signalling to his horse, by pressing it with his heel, the horse sprang over the river, five or six hundred yards in breadth, and stood on the opposite bank.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Bodhisatta, getting down from the horse&rsquo;s back, stood on the sandy beach, extending there like a sheet of silver, and said to Channa, &ldquo;Good Channa, do you now go back, taking my ornaments and Kanthaka. I am going to become an ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;But I also, my lord, will become an ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;You cannot be allowed to renounce the world, you must go back,&rdquo; he said. Three times he refused this request of Channa&rsquo;s; and he delivered over to him both the ornaments and Kanthaka.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then he thought: &ldquo;These locks of mine are not suited for a mendicant. Now it is not right for any one else to cut the hair of a future Buddha, so I will cut them off myself with my sword.&rdquo; Then, taking his sword in his right hand, and holding the plaited tresses, together with the diadem on them, with his left, he cut them off. So his hair was thus reduced to two inches in length, and curling from the right, it lay close to his head. It remained that length as long as he lived, and the beard the same. There was no need at all to shave either hair or beard any more.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Bodhisatta, saying to himself, &ldquo;If I am to become a Buddha, let it stand in the air; if not, let it fall to the ground;&rdquo; threw the hair and diadem together as he held them towards the sky..</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Again the Bodhisatta thought: &ldquo;This my raiment of Benares muslin is not suitable for a mendicant.&rdquo; Now the Deva Ghaṭikāra, who had formerly been his friend in the time of Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, was led by his friendship, which had not grown old in that long interval, to think, &ldquo;Today my friend is accomplishing the Great Renunciation, I will go and provide him with the requisites of a mendicant.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">273. &ldquo;The three robes, and the alms bowl,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">Razor, needle, and girdle,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">And a water strainer &ndash; these eight</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">Are the wealth of the monk devout.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t34">Taking these eight requisites of a mendicant, he gave them to him. The Bodhisatta dressed himself in the outward signs of an Arahat, and adopted the sacred garb of Renunciation; and he enjoined upon Channa to go and, in his name, assure his parents of his safety. And Channa did homage to the Bodhisatta reverently, and departed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1034"></a><span class="t30">On this occasion the monks sat praising the Renunciation of the One with Ten Powers. Entering the Dhamma Hall and seating himself on the Buddha-seat, the Teacher thus addressed the monks, &ldquo;What is your theme, monks, as you sit here in a meeting?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is naught else, sir, than the praise of your own Renunciation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; rejoined the Teacher, &ldquo;not only in these latter days has the Tathāgata</span><a id="a1035"></a><a href="notes.html#a14678"><span class="t9">{221}</span></a><span class="t30"> made a Renunciation; in bygone days too he similarly renounced the world.&rdquo; The monks asked the Fortunate One for an explanation of this.

<p class="p7"><a id="a1037"></a>In the past in Mithilā in the realm of Videha there was a king named Makhādeva, who was righteous and ruled righteously. For successive periods of eighty-four thousand years he had respectively amused himself as prince, ruled as viceroy, and reigned as king. All these long years had he lived, when one day he said to his barber, &ldquo;Tell me, friend barber, when you see any grey hairs in my head.&rdquo; So one day, years and years after, <span class="t18">{1.138}</span> the barber did find among the raven locks of the king a single grey hair, and he told the king so. &ldquo;Pull it out, my friend,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;and lay it in my palm.&rdquo; The barber accordingly plucked the hair out with his golden tongs, and laid it in the king&rsquo;s hand. The king had at that time still eighty-four thousand years more to live; but nevertheless at the sight of that one grey hair he was filled with deep emotion. He seemed to see the king of Death standing over him, or to be cooped within a blazing hut of leaves. &ldquo;Foolish Makhādeva!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;grey hairs have come upon you before you have been able to rid yourself of depravities.&rdquo; And as he thought and thought about the appearance of his grey hair, he grew aflame within; the sweat rolled down from his body; while his raiment oppressed him and seemed intolerable. &ldquo;This very day,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;will I renounce the world for the monk&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1038"></a>To his barber he gave the grant of a village, which yielded a hundred thousand pieces of money. He sent for his eldest son and said to him, &ldquo;My son, grey hairs are come upon me, and I am become old. I have had my fill of human joys, and fain would taste the joys divine; the time for my renunciation has come. Take the sovereignty upon yourself; as for me, I will take up my abode in the pleasure gardens called Makhādeva&rsquo;s Mango-grove, and there tread the ascetic&rsquo;s path.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">As he was thus bent on leading the monk&rsquo;s life, his ministers drew near and said: &ldquo;What is the reason, sire, why you adopt the monk&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Taking the grey hair in his hand, the king repeated this verse to his ministers:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Uttamaṅgaruhā mayhaṁ ime jātā vayoharā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pātubhūtā devadūtā, pabbajjāsamayo mamā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">These greying hairs growing on my head carry off my youthful life, divine messengers manifest, it is time for me to go forth. </span><span class="t18">{1.139}</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a1039"></a>And after these words, he renounced his sovereignty that self-same day and became a recluse. Dwelling in that very Mango-grove of Makhādeva, he there during eighty-four thousand years fostered the four Divine Abidings within himself, and, dying with Absorption full and unbroken, was reborn in the Realm of Brahmā. Passing thence, he became a king again in Mithilā, under the name of Nimi, and after uniting his scattered family, once more became an ascetic in that same <a id="a1040"></a><span class="t18">[1.32]</span> Mango-grove, winning the Four Divine Abidings and passing thence once more to the Realm of Brahmā.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After repeating his statement that he had similarly renounced the world in bygone days, the Teacher at the end of his lesson preached the Four Truths. Some entered the First Path, some the Second, and some the Third. Having told the two stories, the Teacher showed the connection between them and identified the Jātaka, by saying: &ldquo;In those days Ānanda was the barber, Rāhula the son, and I myself king Makhādeva.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a1051"></a><a id="a1052"></a><span class="t30">The venerable Bhaddiya, who used in the days of his royalty to guard himself as though he were appointed his own tutelary deity, bethought him of the state of fear in which he then lived when he was being guarded by numerous guards and when he used to toss about even on his royal couch in his private apartments high up in the palace; and with this he compared the absence of fear in which, now that he was an Arahat, he roamed here and there in forests and desert places. And at the thought he burst into this exalted utterance, &ldquo;Oh, happiness! Oh, happiness!&rdquo;</span><a id="a1053"></a><span class="t18"> [1.33]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This the monks reported to the Fortunate One, saying: &ldquo;The venerable Bhaddiya is declaring the bliss he has won.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said the Fortunate One, &ldquo;this is not the first time that Bhaddiya&rsquo;s life has been happy; his life was no less happy in bygone days.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks asked the Fortunate One to explain this. The Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed from them by rebirth.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1054"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a wealthy northern brahmin. Realising the evil of sensual desire and the blessings that flow from renouncing the world, he abjured sensual desire, and retiring to the Himālayas there became an ascetic and won the eight Attainments. His following waxed great, amounting to five hundred ascetics. Once when the rains set in, he quit the Himālayas and travelling along on an alms pilgrimage with his attendant ascetics through village and town came at last to Benares, where he lived in the royal pleasure gardens supported by the king&rsquo;s bounty. After dwelling there for the four rainy months, he came to the king to take his leave. But the king said to him, &ldquo;You are old, venerable sir. Wherefore should you go back to the Himālayas? Send your pupils back there <span class="t18">{1.141}</span> and stop here yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta entrusted his five hundred ascetics to the care of his oldest disciple, saying: &ldquo;Go you with these to the Himālayas; I will stop on here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1055"></a>Now that oldest disciple had once been a king, but had given up a mighty kingdom to become a monk; by focusing on the Meditation Object he had mastered the eight Attainments. As he dwelt with the ascetics in the Himālayas, one day a longing came upon him to see the master, and he said to his fellows, &ldquo;Live on contentedly here; I will come back as soon as I have paid my respects to the master.&rdquo; So away he went to the master, paid his respects to him, and greeted him lovingly. Then he lay down by the side of his master on a mat which he spread there.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1056"></a>At this point appeared the king, who had come to the pleasure gardens to see the ascetic; and with a salutation he took his seat on one side. But though he was aware of the king&rsquo;s presence, that oldest disciple forbore to rise, but still lay there, uttering this exalted utterance, &ldquo;Oh, happiness! Oh, happiness!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Displeased that the ascetic, though he had seen him, had not risen, the king said to the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Venerable sir, this ascetic must have had his fill to eat, seeing that he continues to lie there so happily, uttering this exalted utterance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;of old this ascetic was a king as you are. He is thinking how in the old days when he was a layman and <a id="a1057"></a><span class="t18">[1.34]</span> lived in regal pomp with many a man-at-arms to guard him, he never knew such happiness as now is his. It is the happiness of the monk&rsquo;s life, and the happiness that Absorption brings, which move him to this exalted utterance.&rdquo; And the Bodhisatta further repeated this verse to teach the king the Dhamma:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Yañ-ca aññe na rakkhanti, yo ca aññe na rakkhati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sa ve rāja sukhaṁ seti, kāmesu anapekkhavā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">He who others do not guard, also he who does not guard others, lives easily, king, not having desire for sensual pleasures. </span><span class="t18">{1.142}</span></p>
<p class="p23">Appeased by the lesson thus taught him, the king made his salutation and returned to his palace. The disciple also took his leave of his master and returned to the Himālayas. But the Bodhisatta continued to dwell on there, and, dying with Absorption full and unbroken, was reborn in the Realm of Brahmā.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, and the two stories told, the Teacher showed the connection linking them both together, and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The elder Bhaddiya was the disciple of those days, and I myself the teacher of the company of ascetics.&rdquo;</span></p>

The story of Devadatta</span><a id="a1076"></a><a href="notes.html#a14682"><span class="t9">{223}</span></a><a id="a1077"></a><a id="a1078"></a><a id="a1079"></a><a id="a1080"></a><span class="t30"> will be related, up to the date of the employment of assassins, in the Khaṇḍahālajātaka [Ja 542]; up to the date of his dismissal from the office of Treasurer, in the Cullahaṁsajātaka [Ja 533]; and, up to the date of his being swallowed up by the earth, in the Sixteenth Book in the Samuddavāṇijajātaka [Ja 466].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">For, on the occasion now in question, Devadatta, through failing to carry the Five Points which he had pressed for, had made a schism in the Saṅgha and had gone off with five hundred monks to dwell at Gayāsīsa. Now, these monks came to a riper knowledge; and the Teacher, knowing this, called the </span><a id="a1081"></a><span class="t18">[1.35]</span><a id="a1082"></a><span class="t30"> two chief disciples</span><a id="a1083"></a><a href="notes.html#a14684"><span class="t9">{224}</span></a><span class="t30"> and said: &ldquo;Sāriputta, your five hundred pupils who were perverted by Devadatta&rsquo;s teaching and went off with him, have now come to a riper knowledge. Go there with a number of the monks, preach the Dhamma to them, enlighten these wanderers respecting the Paths and the Fruits, and bring them back with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">They went there, preached the Dhamma, enlightened them respecting the Paths and the Fruits, and next day </span><span class="t18">{1.143}</span><span class="t30"> at dawn came back again with those monks to the Bamboo Grove. And while Sāriputta was standing there after saluting the Fortunate One on his return, the monks spoke thus to him in praise of the elder Sāriputta, &ldquo;Sir, very bright was the glory of our elder brother, the Captain of the Dhamma, as he returned with a following of five hundred monks; whereas Devadatta has lost all his following.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;This is not the only time, monks, when glory has been Sāriputta&rsquo;s on his return with a following of his kinsfolk; like glory was his too in bygone days. So too this is not the only time when Devadatta has lost his following; he lost it also in bygone days.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks asked the Fortunate One to explain this to them. The Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed by rebirth.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1084"></a><a id="a1085"></a>In the past in the city of Rājagaha in the kingdom of Magadha there ruled a certain king of Magadha, in whose days the Bodhisatta came to life as a stag. Growing up, he dwelt in the forest as the leader of a herd of a thousand deer. He had two young ones named Lakkhaṇa [Lucky] and Kāḷa [Unlucky]. When he grew old, he handed his charge over to his two sons, placing five hundred deer under the care of each of them. And so now these two young stags were in charge of the herd.</p>
<p class="p7">Towards harvest-time in Magadha, when the crops stand thick in the fields, it is dangerous for the deer in the forests round. Anxious to kill the creatures that devour their crops, the peasants dig pitfalls, fix stakes, set stone-traps, and plant snares and other traps; so that many deer are slain.</p>
<p class="p7">Accordingly, when the Bodhisatta marked that it was crop-time, he sent for his two sons and said to them, &ldquo;My children, it is now the time when crops stand thick in the fields, and many deer meet their death at this season. We who are old will make shift to stay in one spot; but you will retire each with your herd to the mountainous tracts in the forest and come back when the crops have been carried.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said his two sons, and departed with their herds, as their father bade.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the men who live along the route, know quite well the times at which deer take to the hills and return thence. And <span class="t18">{1.144}</span> lying in wait in hiding-places here and there along the route, they shoot and kill numbers of them. The dullard Kāḷa, ignorant of the times to travel and the <a id="a1086"></a><span class="t18">[1.36]</span><a id="a1087"></a> times to halt, kept his deer on the march early and late, both at dawn and in the evening, approaching the very confines of the villages. And the peasants, in ambush or in the open, destroyed numbers of his herd. Having thus by his crass folly worked the destruction of all these, it was with a very few survivors that he reached the forest.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1088"></a>Lakkhaṇa on the other hand, being wise and astute and having skill in means, never so much as approached the confines of a village. He did not travel by day, or even in the dawn or evening. Only in the dead of night did he move; and the result was that he reached the forest without losing a single head of his deer.</p>
<p class="p7">Four months they stayed in the forest, not leaving the hills till the crops were carried. On the homeward way Kāḷa, by repeating his former folly, lost the rest of his herd and returned solitary and alone; whereas Lakkhaṇa had not lost one of his herd, but had brought back the whole five hundred deer, when he appeared before his parents. As he saw his two sons returning, the Bodhisatta framed this verse in concert with the herd of deer:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Hoti sīlavataṁ attho, paṭisanthāravuttinaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lakkhaṇaṁ passa āyantaṁ, ñātisaṅghapurakkhataṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Atha passasimaṁ Kāḷaṁ, suvihīnaṁ va ñātibhī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">The virtuous one will prosper, he whose way of life is friendly, look at Lakkhaṇa approaching, surrounded by his relatives, then look at this Kāḷa, who has completely lost his relatives. </span><span class="t18">{1.145}</span></p>
<p class="p23">Such was the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s welcome to his son; and after living to a good old age, he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At the close of his lesson, when the Teacher had repeated that Sāriputta&rsquo;s glory and Devadatta&rsquo;s loss had both had a parallel in bygone days, he showed the connection linking the two stories together and identified the Jātaka, by saying: &ldquo;Devadatta was the Kāḷa of those days; his followers were Kāḷa&rsquo;s following; Sāriputta was the Lakkhaṇa of those days, and his following the Buddha&rsquo;s followers; Rāhula&rsquo;s mother was the mother of those days; and I myself was the father.&rdquo;</span></p>

As soon as she reached knowledge of herself, she took no joy in a worldly life but yearned to renounce the world. With this aim, she said to her mother and father, &ldquo;My dear parents, my heart takes no joy in a worldly life; fain would I embrace the dispensation which leads to safety of the Buddha. Allow me to take the vows.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;What, my dear? Ours is a very wealthy family, and you are our only daughter. You cannot take the vows.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1105"></a><span class="t30">Having failed to win her parents&rsquo; consent, though she asked them again and again, she thought to herself, &ldquo;Be it so then; when I am married into another family, I will gain my husband&rsquo;s consent and take the vows.&rdquo; And when, being grown up, she entered another family, she proved a devoted wife and lived a life of goodness and virtue</span><a id="a1106"></a><a href="notes.html#a14688"><span class="t9">{226}</span></a><span class="t30"> in her new home.

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">There was a festival proclaimed in that city, </span><span class="t18">{1.146}</span><span class="t30"> and everybody kept holiday, the city being decked like a city of the gods.

<p class="p7"><a id="a1107"></a><span class="t30">&ldquo;My lord and master,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;the body is filled with two-and-thirty component parts. Wherefore should it be adorned? This bodily frame is not fashioned after a Deva or a Brahmā; it is not made of gold, jewels, or yellow sandalwood; it takes not its birth from the womb of lotus-flowers, white or red or blue; it is not filled with any immortal balsam. Nay, it is bred of corruption, and born of mortal parents; the qualities that mark it are the wearing and wasting away, the decay and destruction of the merely transient; it is fated to swell a graveyard, and is devoted to sensual desires; it is the source of sorrow, and the occasion of lamentation; it is the abode of all diseases, and the repository of the workings of Karma. Foul within &ndash; it is always excreting. Yea, as all the world can see, its end is death, passing to the charnel-house, there to be the dwelling-place of worms.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Connected by bones and sinews, smeared with skin and flesh, the body is covered with the tegument, it is not seen for what it really is.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Filled with intestines, filled with stomach, having liver, bladder, heart, lungs, kidneys, and spleen, mucus, saliva, sweat and fat, blood, sinovial fluid, bile and sweat.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Furthermore, from the nine openings flow excrements on all sides, eye-excrement from the eyes, ear-excrement from the ears, mucus from the nose, and sometimes one vomits from the mouth, one throws up bile and phlegm, from the body flow sweat and dirt.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Furthermore, the hollow of the head is filled with the brain. The fool regards this as beautiful, being surrounded by ignorance (Snp. 196-201).</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">There is endless danger in the body, it is like a poisonous tree, the abode of all illnesses, a complete heap of suffering (Tha-ap. 55).</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">If from this body the inside would be exposed, one would need to take a stick to ward off the crows and dogs.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">The impure body smells bad, like a cesspit, a toilet, the body, that fools take delight in, is condemned by those having insight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Covered with moist flesh, having nine openings, a great wound, it flows with stinking excrements on all sides (Vsm. 1.122).</span><span class="t18"> {1.147}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a1108"></a><span class="t30">What should I achieve, my bridegroom, by tricking out this body? Would not its adornment be like decorating the outside of a bed pan?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;My dear wife,&rdquo; rejoined the young merchant, &ldquo;if you regard this body as so sinful, why don&rsquo;t you become a nun?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;If I am accepted, my husband, I will take the vows this very day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will get you admitted to the Saṅgha.&rdquo; And after he had shown lavish bounty and hospitality to the Saṅgha, he escorted her with a large following to the nunnery and had her admitted a nun &ndash; but of the following of Devadatta. Great was her joy at the fulfilment of her desire to become a nun.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">As her time drew near, the nuns, noticing the change in her person, the swelling in her hands and feet and her increased size, said: &ldquo;Lady, you seem about to become a mother; what does it mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;I cannot tell, ladies; I only know I have led a virtuous life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So the nuns brought her before Devadatta, saying: &ldquo;Lord, this young gentle-woman, who was admitted a nun with the reluctant consent of her husband, has now proved to be with child; but whether this dates from before her admission to the Saṅgha or not, we cannot say. What are we to do now?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Not being a Buddha, and not having any patience, loving-kindness or sympathy, Devadatta thought thus, &ldquo;It will be a damaging report to get abroad that one of my nuns is with child, and that I condone the offence. My course is clear &ndash; I must expel this woman from the Saṅgha.&rdquo; Without any enquiry, starting forward as if to thrust aside a mass of stone, he said: &ldquo;Away, and expel this woman!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Receiving this answer, they arose and with reverent salutation withdrew to their own nunnery. But the girl said to those nuns, &ldquo;Ladies, Devadatta the elder is not the Buddha. My vows were taken not under Devadatta, but under </span><a id="a1109"></a><span class="t18">[1.38]</span><span class="t30"> the Buddha, the foremost in the world. Rob me not of the vocation I won so hardly; but take me before the Teacher at Jetavana.&rdquo; So they set out with her for Jetavana, and journeying over the forty-five leagues there from Rājagaha, came in due course to their destination, where with reverent salutation to the Teacher, they laid the matter before him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Thought the Teacher, &ldquo;Albeit the child was conceived while she was still of the laity, yet it will give the heretics an occasion to say that the ascetic Gotama </span><span class="t18">{1.148}</span><span class="t30"> has taken a nun expelled by Devadatta. Therefore, to cut short such talk, this case must be heard in the presence of the king and his court.&rdquo; So on the morrow he sent for Pasenadi king of Kosala, the elder and the younger Anāthapiṇḍika, the lady Visākhā the great lay-disciple, and other well-known personages; and in the evening when the four classes of the faithful were all assembled &ndash; monks, nuns, and lay-disciples, both male and female &ndash; he said to the elder Upāli, &ldquo;Go, and clear up this matter of the young nun in the presence of the four classes of my disciples.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;It shall be done, venerable sir,&rdquo; said the elder, and forth to the assembly he went and there, seating himself in his place, he called up Visākhā the lay-disciple in sight of the king, and placed the conduct of the enquiry in her hands, saying: &ldquo;First ascertain the precise day of the precise month on which this girl joined the Saṅgha, Visākhā; and thence compute whether she conceived before or since that date.&rdquo; Accordingly the lady had a curtain put up as a screen, behind which she retired with the girl. Looking at the hands, the feet, the navel, at the very belly of the damsel</span><a id="a1110"></a><a href="notes.html#a14690"><span class="t9">{227}</span></a><span class="t30"> the lady found, on comparing the days and months, that the conception had taken place before the girl had become a nun. This she reported to the elder, who proclaimed the nun innocent before all the assembly. And she, now that her innocence was established, reverently saluted the Saṅgha and the Teacher, and with the nuns returned to her own nunnery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When her time was come, she bore the son strong in spirit, for whom she had prayed at the feet of the Buddha Padumuttara ages ago. One day, when the king was passing by the nunnery, he heard the cry of an infant and asked his courtiers what it meant. They, knowing the facts, told his majesty that the cry came from the child to which the young nun had given birth. &ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;the care of children is a clog on nuns in their ascetic life; let us take charge of him.&rdquo; So the infant was handed over by the king&rsquo;s command to the ladies of his family, and brought up as a prince. When the day came for him to be named, he was called Kassapa, but was known as prince Kassapa [Kassapakumāra] because he was brought up like a prince.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1111"></a><span class="t30">At the age of seven he was admitted a novice under the Teacher, and a full monk when he was old enough. As time went on, he waxed famous among the expounders of the Dhamma. So the Teacher gave him precedence, saying: &ldquo;Monks, the first in eloquence among my disciples is prince Kassapa.&rdquo; Afterwards, by virtue of the Vammīkasutta,</span><a id="a1112"></a><a href="notes.html#a14694"><span class="t9">{228}</span></a><span class="t30"> he became an Arahat. So too his mother, the nun, grew to clear insight and won the Supreme Fruit. Prince Kassapa the elder shone in the dispensation of the Buddha </span><a id="a1113"></a><span class="t18">{1.149}</span><span class="t30"> even as the full-moon in the mid-heaven.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now one day in the afternoon when the Tathāgata on return from his alms-round had addressed the monks, he passed into his perfumed chamber. At the close of his address the monks spent the daytime either in their night-quarters or in their day-quarters till it was evening, when they assembled in the Dhamma Hall and spoke as follows, &ldquo;Monks, Devadatta, because he was not a Buddha and because he had no patience, loving-kindness or sympathy, was nigh being the ruin of the elder prince Kassapa and his venerable mother. But the Supreme Buddha, being the Lord of Dhamma and being perfect in patience, loving-kindness and sympathy, has provided their foundation.&rdquo; And as they sat there telling the praises of the Buddha, he entered the hall with all the grace of a Buddha, and asked, as he took his seat, what they were talking of as they sat together. &ldquo;Of your own virtues, sir,&rdquo; they said, and told him all.</span><a id="a1114"></a><span class="t18"> [1.39]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;This is not the first time, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that the Tathāgata has proved to be a foundation and refuge of these two: he was the same to them in the past also.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then, on the monks asking him to explain this to them, he revealed what rebirth had hidden from them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1115"></a><a id="a1116"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a deer. At his birth he was golden of hue; his eyes were like round jewels; the sheen of his horns was as of silver; his mouth was red as a bunch of scarlet cloth; his four hoofs were as though lacquered; his tail was like the yak&rsquo;s; and he was as big as a young foal. Attended by five hundred deer, he dwelt in the forest under the name of king Nigrodha [Banyan]. And nearby him dwelt another deer also with an attendant herd of five hundred deer, who was named Sākha [Branch], and was as golden of hue as the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p class="p7">In those days the king of Benares was passionately fond of hunting, and always had meat at every meal. Every day he mustered the whole of his subjects, townsfolk and countryfolk alike, to the detriment of their business, and went hunting. Thought his people, &ldquo;This king of ours stops all our work. Suppose we were <span class="t18">{1.150}</span> to sow food and supply water for the deer in his own pleasure gardens, and, having driven in a number of deer, to fence them in and deliver them over to the king!&rdquo; So they sowed in the pleasure gardens grass for the deer to eat and supplied water for them to drink, and opened the gate wide. Then they called out the townsfolk and set out into the forest armed with sticks and all manner of weapons to find the deer. They surrounded about a league of forest in order to catch the deer within their circle, and in so doing surrounded the haunt of the Nigrodha and Sākha. As soon as they perceived the deer, they proceeded to beat the trees, bushes and ground with their sticks till they drove the herds out of their lairs; then they rattled their swords and spears and bows with so great a din that they drove all the deer into the pleasure gardens, and shut the gate. Then they went to the king and said: &ldquo;Sire, you put a stop to our work by always going hunting; so we have driven deer enough from the forest to fill your pleasure gardens. Henceforth feed on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Hereupon the king betook himself to the pleasure gardens, and in looking over the herd saw among them two golden deer, to whom he granted immunity. Sometimes he would go of his own accord and shoot a deer to bring home; sometimes his cook would go and shoot one. At first sight of the bow, the deer would dash off trembling for their lives, but after receiving two or three wounds they grew weary and faint and were slain. The herd of deer told this to the Bodhisatta, who sent for Sākha and said: &ldquo;Friend, the deer are being destroyed in great numbers; and, though they <a id="a1117"></a><span class="t18">[1.40]</span><a id="a1118"></a> cannot escape death, at least let them not be needlessly wounded. Let the deer go to the block<a id="a1119"></a><a href="notes.html#a14696"><span class="t9">{229}</span></a> by turns, one day one from my herd, and next day one from yours &ndash; the deer on whom the lot falls to go to the place of execution and lie down with its head on the block. In this wise the deer will escape wounding.&rdquo; The other agreed; and thenceforth the deer whose turn it was, used to go <span class="t18">{1.151}</span> and lie down with its neck ready on the block. The cook used to go and carry off only the victim which awaited him.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day the lot fell on a pregnant doe of the herd of Sākha, and she went to Sākha and said: &ldquo;Lord, I am with young. When I have brought forth my little one, there will be two of us to take our turn. Order me to be passed over this turn.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I cannot make your turn another&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must bear the consequences of your own fortune. Begone!&rdquo; Finding no favour with him, the doe went on to the Bodhisatta and told him her story. And he answered, &ldquo;Very well; you go away, and I will see that the turn passes over you.&rdquo; And therewithal he went himself to the place of execution and lay down with his head on the block. The cook cried out on seeing him, &ldquo;Why here&rsquo;s the king of the deer who was granted immunity! What does this mean?&rdquo; And off he ran to tell the king. The moment he heard of it, the king mounted his chariot and arrived with a large following. &ldquo;My friend the king of the deer,&rdquo; he said on beholding the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;did I not promise you your life? How comes it that you are lying here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sire, there came to me a doe big with young, who prayed me to let her turn fall on another; and, as I could not pass the doom of one on to another, I, laying down my life for her and taking her doom on myself, have laid me down here. Think not that there is anything behind this, your majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1120"></a>&ldquo;My lord the golden king of the deer,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;never yet saw I, even among men, one so abounding in patience, loving-kindness and sympathy as you. Therefore am I pleased with you. Arise! I spare the lives both of you and of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Though two be spared, what shall the rest do, O king of men?&rdquo; &ldquo;I spare their lives too, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, only the deer in your pleasure gardens will thus have gained immunity; what shall all the rest do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Their lives too I spare, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, deer will thus be safe; but what will the rest of four-footed creatures do?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{1.152}</span> &ldquo;I spare their lives too, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, four-footed creatures will thus be safe; but what will the flocks of birds do?&rdquo; &ldquo;They too shall be spared, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, birds will thus be safe; but what will the fishes do, who live in the water?&rdquo; &ldquo;I spare their lives also, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">After thus interceding with the king for the lives of all creatures, the <a id="a1121"></a><span class="t18">[1.41]</span> Great Being arose, established the king in the Five Precepts, saying: &ldquo;Walk in righteousness, great king. Walk in righteousness and justice towards parents, children, townsmen, and countryfolk, so that when this earthly body is dissolved, you may enter the bliss of heaven.&rdquo; Thus, with the grace and charm that marks a Buddha, did he teach the Dhamma to the king. A few days he tarried in the pleasure gardens for the king&rsquo;s instruction, and then with his attendant herd he passed into the forest again.</p>
<p class="p7">And that doe brought forth a fawn fair as the opening bud of the lotus, who used to play about with Sākha deer. Seeing this his mother said to him, &ldquo;My child, don&rsquo;t go about with him, only go about with the herd of the Nigrodha deer.&rdquo; And by way of exhortation, she repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Nigrodham-eva seveyya, na Sākham-upasaṁvase,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nigrodhasmiṁ mataṁ seyyo, yañ-ce Sākhasmi jīvitan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Associate with Nigrodha, associate not with Sākha, better is death with Nigrodha, than is having life with Sākha.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thenceforth, the deer, now in the enjoyment of immunity, used to eat men&rsquo;s crops, and the men, remembering the immunity granted to them, did not dare to hit the deer or drive them away. So they assembled in the king&rsquo;s courtyard and laid the matter before the king. Said he, &ldquo;When the Nigrodha deer won my favour, <span class="t18">{1.153}</span> I promised him a boon. I will forego my kingdom rather than my promise. Begone! Not a man in my kingdom may harm the deer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">But when this came to the ears of the Nigrodha deer, he called his herd together and said: &ldquo;Henceforth you shall not eat the crops of others.&rdquo; And having thus forbidden them, he sent a message to the men, saying: &ldquo;From this day forward, let no farmer fence his field, but merely indicate it with leaves tied up round it.&rdquo; And so we hear began a plan of tying up leaves to indicate the fields; and never was a deer known to trespass on a field so marked. For thus they had been instructed by the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p class="p7">Thus did the Bodhisatta exhort the deer of his herd, and thus did he act all his life long, and at the close of a long life passed away with them to fare according to his deeds. The king too abode by the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s teachings, and after a life spent in good works passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At the close of this lesson, when the Teacher had repeated that, as now, so in bygone days also he had been the support of the pair, he preached the Four Truths. He then showed the connection, linking together the two stories he had told, and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Devadatta was the deer called Sākha of </span><a id="a1122"></a><span class="t18">[1.42]</span><span class="t30"> those days, and his followers were that deer&rsquo;s herd; the nun was the doe, and prince Kassapa was her offspring; Ānanda was the king; and I myself was the deer king Nigrodha.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Cursed be the dart, the barb.&rdquo;</span><a id="a1131"></a><a id="a1132"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about the temptation caused to monks by the wives of their mundane life. This will be related in the Indriyajātaka [Ja 423] in the Eighth Book.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The story is that a young man of good family at Sāvatthi heard the Teacher&rsquo;s preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymen&rsquo;s houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. He took what he had got to the wife he had left: she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. &ldquo;Salute him and bid him pass on.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, &ldquo;This is the father of my sons.&rdquo; She came out and saluted him: taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food: when he had eaten she saluted again and said: &ldquo;Sir, you are a saint now: we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householder&rsquo;s life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country: be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.&rdquo; For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: &ldquo;I cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life; send a layman&rsquo;s garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.&rdquo; She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Said the Fortunate One to the monk, &ldquo;Monk, it was because of this very woman that in bygone days you met your death and were roasted over glowing embers.&rdquo; The monks asked the Fortunate One to explain this. The Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed from them by rebirth. </span><span class="t18">{1.154}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">(Henceforth we shall omit the words respecting the monk&rsquo;s request for an explanation and the making clear what had been concealed by rebirth; and we shall only say, &ldquo;Told this story of the past.&rdquo; When only this is said, all the rest is to be supplied and repeated as above &ndash; the request, the simile of setting free the moon from the clouds, and the making clear what had been concealed by rebirth.)</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past in the kingdom of Magadha the king was reigning in Rājagaha, and when the crops were grown the deer were exposed to great perils, so that they retired to the forest. Now a certain mountain-stag of the forest, having become attached to a doe who came from near a village, was moved by his love for her to accompany her when the deer returned home from the forest. Said she, &ldquo;You, sir, are but a simple stag of the forest, and the neighbourhood of villages is beset with peril and danger. So don&rsquo;t come down with us.&rdquo; But he, because of his great love for her, would not stay, but came with her.<a id="a1133"></a><span class="t18"> [1.43]</span></p>
<p class="p7">When they knew that it was the time for the deer to come down from the hills, the Magadha folk posted themselves in ambush by the road; and a hunter was lying in wait just by the road along which the pair were travelling. Scenting a man, the young doe suspected that a hunter was in ambush, and let the stag go on first, following herself at some distance. With a single arrow the hunter laid the stag low, and the doe seeing him struck was off like the wind. Then that hunter came forth from his hiding place and skinned the stag and lighting a fire cooked the sweet flesh over the embers. Having eaten and drunk, he took home the remainder of the bleeding carcass on his carrying-pole to regale his children.</p>
<p class="p7">Now in those days the Bodhisatta was a Devatā dwelling in that very grove of trees, and he marked what had come to pass. &ldquo; &rsquo;Twas not father or mother, but passion alone that destroyed this foolish deer. <span class="t18">{1.155}</span> The dawn of passion is bliss, but its end is sorrow and suffering &ndash; the painful loss of hands, and the misery of the five forms of bonds and blows. To cause another&rsquo;s death is accounted infamy in this world; infamous too is the land which owns a woman&rsquo;s sway and rule; and infamous are the men who yield themselves to women&rsquo;s dominion.&rdquo; And therewithal, while the other fairies of the wood applauded and offered perfumes and flowers and the like in homage, the Bodhisatta wove the three infamies into a single verse, and made the wood re-echo with his sweet tones as he taught the truth in these lines:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Dhi-r-atthu kaṇḍinaṁ, sallaṁ, purisaṁ gāḷhavedhinaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dhi-r-atthu taṁ janapadaṁ yatthitthī pariṇāyikā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Te cāpi dhikkitā sattā ye itthīnaṁ vasaṁ gatā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Cursed be the dart, the barb, that strongly pierces into a person, cursed be the country where women are the advisors of the king, blameable are those beings who come under the sway of women.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus in a single verse were the three infamies comprised by the Bodhisatta, and the woods re-echoed as he taught the Dhamma with all the mastery and grace of a Buddha. <span class="t18">{1.156}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof the love-sick monk was established in the Fruit of the First Path.

Tradition says that, while the Teacher was dwelling at the Bamboo Grove near Rājagaha, the scion of a wealthy house, prince Tissa by name, coming one day to the Bamboo Grove and there hearing a discourse from the Teacher, wished to join the Saṅgha, but, being refused because his parents would not give their consent, obtained their consent by following Raṭṭhapāla&rsquo;s</span><a id="a1142"></a><a href="notes.html#a14699"><span class="t9">{230}</span></a><span class="t30"> example and refusing food for seven days, and finally took the vows with the Teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1143"></a><span class="t30">About a fortnight after admitting this young man, the Teacher went from the Bamboo Grove to Jetavana, where the young nobleman undertook the thirteen ascetic practices</span><a id="a1144"></a><a href="notes.html#a14701"><span class="t9">{231}</span></a><span class="t30"> and passed his time in going his round for alms from house to house, omitting none. Under the name of the elder Cullapiṇḍapātika Tissa, he became as bright and shining a light in the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation as the moon in the vault of heaven.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">A festival having been proclaimed at this time at Rājagaha, the elder&rsquo;s mother and father laid in a silver casket the trinkets he used to wear as a layman, and took it to heart, bewailing thus, &ldquo;At other festivals our son used to wear this or that finery as he kept the festival; and he, our only son, has been taken away by the ascetic Gotama to the town of Sāvatthi. Where is our son sitting now or standing?&rdquo; Now a slave girl who came to the house, noticed the lady of the house weeping, and asked her why she was weeping; and the lady told her all.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;What, madam, was your son fond of?&rdquo; &ldquo;Of such and such a thing,&rdquo; replied the lady. &ldquo;Well, if you will give me authority in this house, I&rsquo;ll fetch your son back.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the lady in assent, and gave the girl her expenses and dispatched her with a large following, saying: &ldquo;Go, and manage to fetch my son back.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So away the girl rode in a palanquin to Sāvatthi, where she took up her residence in the street which the elder used to frequent for alms. </span><span class="t18">{1.157}</span><span class="t30"> Surrounding herself with servants of her own, and never allowing the elder to see his father&rsquo;s people about, she watched the moment when the elder entered the street and at once bestowed on him an alms of food and drink. And when she had bound him in the bonds of the craving to taste, she got him eventually to seat himself in the house, till she knew that her gifts of food as alms had put him in her power. Then she feigned sickness and lay down in an inner chamber.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">In the due course of his round for alms at the proper time, the elder came to the door of her house; and her people took the elder&rsquo;s bowl and made him sit down in the house.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When he had seated himself, he said: &ldquo;Where is the lay-sister?&rdquo; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s ill, sir; she would be glad to see you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Bound as he was by the bonds of the craving to taste, he broke his vow and obligation, and went to where the woman was lying.</span><a id="a1145"></a><span class="t18"> [1.45]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then she told him the reason of her coming, and so wrought on him that, all because of his being hound by the bonds of the craving to taste, she made him forsake the Saṅgha; when he was in her power, she put him in the palanquin and came back with a large following to Rājagaha again. All this was noised abroad.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Sitting in the Dhamma Hall, the monks discussed the matter, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, it is reported that a slave girl has bound in the bonds of the craving of taste, and has carried off, the elder Tissa Cullapiṇḍapātika.&rdquo; Entering the Hall the Teacher sat down on his jewelled seat, and said: &ldquo;What, monks, is the subject of discussion in this conclave?&rdquo; They told him the incident.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is not the first time that, in bondage to the craving of taste, he has fallen into her power; in bygone days too he fell into her power in like manner.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1146"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares he had a gardener named Sañjaya. Now there came into the king&rsquo;s pleasure gardens a Wind-Deer, which fled away at the sight of Sañjaya, but the latter let it go without terrifying the timid creature. After several visits the antelope used to roam about in the pleasure gardens. Now the gardener was in the habit of gathering flowers and fruits and taking them day by day to the king. Said the king to him one day, &ldquo;Have you noticed anything strange, friend gardener, in the pleasure gardens?&rdquo; &ldquo;Only, sir, that a Wind-Deer has come about the grounds.&rdquo; &ldquo;Could you catch it, do you think?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes; if I had a little honey, I&rsquo;d bring it right into your majesty&rsquo;s palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king ordered the honey to be given to the man and he went off with it to the pleasure gardens, where he first anointed with the honey the grass at the spots frequented by the deer, <span class="t18">{1.158}</span><a id="a1147"></a> and then hid himself. When the deer came and tasted the honied grass it was so snared by the lust of taste that it would go nowhere else but only to the pleasure gardens. Marking the success of his snare, the gardener began gradually to show himself. The appearance of the man made the deer take to flight for the first day or two, but growing familiar with the sight of him, it gathered confidence and gradually came to eat grass from the man&rsquo;s hand. He, noting that the creature&rsquo;s confidence had been won, first strewed the path as thick as a carpet with broken boughs; then tying a gourd full of honey on his shoulder and sticking a bunch of grass in his waist-cloth, he kept dropping wisps of the honied grass in front of the deer till at last he got it right inside the palace. No sooner was the deer inside than they shut the door. At sight of men the deer, in fear and trembling for its life, dashed to and fro about the hall; and the king coming down from his chamber above, and seeing the trembling creature, said: &ldquo;So timid is the Wind-Deer that for a whole week it will not revisit a spot where it has so much as seen a man; and if it has once been frightened anywhere, it never goes back there again all its life long. Yet, <a id="a1148"></a><span class="t18">[1.46]</span> ensnared by the lust of taste, this wild thing from the jungle has actually come to a place like this. Truly, my friends, there is nothing viler in the world than this craving for taste.&rdquo; And he put his teaching into this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Na kiratthi rasehi pāpiyo,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Āvāsehi va, santhavehi vā.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vātamigaṁ gehanissitaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vasam-ānesi rasehi Sañjayo ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">It seems that there is nothing worse than tastes, amongst those in homes, or acquaintances. The wind-deer, who depended on his home, was brought under Sañjaya&rsquo;s control by taste.</span></p>
<p class="p23">And with these words he let the antelope go back to its forest again. <span class="t18">{1.159}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended his lesson, and had repeated what he had said as to that monk&rsquo;s having fallen into that woman&rsquo;s power in bygone days as well as in the present time, he showed the connection and identified the Jātaka, by saying: &ldquo;In those days this slave girl was Sañjaya, Cullapiṇḍapātika was the wind-antelope, and I myself was the king of Benares.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;It is true, Fortunate One,&rdquo; was the reply.</span></p>

<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares the Bodhisatta was born a deer and dwelt in the forest at the head of a herd of deer. His sister brought her son to him, saying: &ldquo;Brother, this is your nephew; teach him the deer&rsquo;s ruses.&rdquo; And thus she placed her son under the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s care. Said the latter to his nephew, &ldquo;Come at such and such a time and I will give you a lesson.&rdquo; But the nephew made no appearance at the time appointed. And, as on that day, so on seven days did he skip his lesson and fail to learn the ruses of deer; and at last, as he was roaming about, he was caught in a trap. His mother came and said to the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Brother, was not your nephew taught deer&rsquo;s ruses?&rdquo;<a id="a1155"></a><span class="t18"> [1.47]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Take no thought for the unteachable rascal,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta; <span class="t18">{1.160}</span> &ldquo;your son failed to learn the ruses of deer.&rdquo; And so saying, having lost all desire to advise the scapegrace even in his deadly peril, he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Aṭṭhakkhuraṁ Kharādiye, migaṁ vaṅkātivaṅkinaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;The deer in three postures.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while dwelling at the Badarika monastery in Kosambī, about the elder Rāhula whose heart was set on observing the rules of the Saṅgha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Once when the Teacher was dwelling in the Aggāḷava Temple nearby the town of Āḷavi, many female lay-disciples and nuns used to flock there to hear the Dhamma preached. The preaching was in the daytime, but as time </span><a id="a1166"></a><span class="t18">[1.48]</span><span class="t30"> wore on, the women did not attend, and there were only monks and men disciples present. Then the preaching took place in the evening; and at the close the elder monks retired each to his own chamber. But the younger ones with the lay-disciples lay down to rest in the Attendance Hall. When they fell asleep, loud was the snoring and snorting and gnashing of teeth as they lay. </span><span class="t18">{1.161}</span><span class="t30"> After a short slumber some got up, and reported to the Fortunate One the impropriety which they had witnessed. Said he, &ldquo;If a monk sleeps in the company of novices, it is a Pācittiya offence (requiring confession).&rdquo; And after delivering this precept he went away to Kosambī.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Thereon the monks said to the venerable Rāhula, &ldquo;Sir, the Fortunate One has laid down this precept, and now you will please find quarters of your own.&rdquo; Now, before this, the monks, out of respect for the father and because of the anxious desire of the son to observe the rules of the Saṅgha, had welcomed the youth as if the place were his; they had fitted up a little bed for him, and had given him a cloth to make a pillow with. But on the day of our story they would not even give him house-room, so fearful were they of transgressing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The excellent Rāhula went neither to the One with Ten Powers as being his father, nor to Sāriputta, Captain of the Dhamma, as being his preceptor, nor to the Great Moggallāna as being his teacher, nor to the elder Ānanda as being his uncle; but betook himself to the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; outhouse and took up his abode there as though in a heavenly mansion. Now in the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; outhouse the door is always closely shut: the levelled floor is of perfumed earth; flowers and garlands are festooned round the walls; and all night long a lamp burns there. But it was not this splendour which prompted Rāhula to take up his residence here. Nay, it was simply because the monks had told him to find quarters for himself, and because he reverenced instruction and yearned to observe the rules of the Saṅgha. Indeed, from time to time the monks, to test him, when they saw him coming from quite a distance, used to throw down a hand-broom or a little dust-sweepings, and then ask who had thrown it down, after Rāhula had come in. &ldquo;Well, Rāhula came that way,&rdquo; would be the remark, but never did the future elder say he knew nothing about it. On the contrary, he used to remove the litter and humbly ask pardon of the monk, nor go away till he was assured that he was pardoned; so anxious was he to observe the rules. And it was solely this anxiety which made him take up his dwelling in the outhouse.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now, though day had not yet dawned, the Teacher halted at the door of the outhouse and coughed, &ldquo;Ahem.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ahem,&rdquo; responded the venerable Rāhula. &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; said the Buddha. &ldquo;It is I, Rāhula,&rdquo; was the reply; and out came the young man and bowed low. &ldquo;Why have you been sleeping here, Rāhula?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because I had nowhere to go to. Up till now, sir, the monks have been very kind to me; but such is their present fear of erring </span><span class="t18">{1.162}</span><span class="t30"> that they won&rsquo;t give me shelter any more. Consequently, I took up my abode here, because I thought it a spot where I should not come into contact with anybody else.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then thought the Teacher to himself, &ldquo;If they treat even Rāhula like this, what will they not do to other youths whom they admit to the Saṅgha?&rdquo; And his heart was moved within him for the Dhamma. So, at an early hour he had the monks assembled, and questioned the Captain of the Dhamma thus, &ldquo;I suppose you at all events, Sāriputta, know where Rāhula is now quartered?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;No, sir, I do not.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Sāriputta, Rāhula was living this day in the outhouse. Sāriputta, if you treat Rāhula like this, what will be your treatment of other youths who go forth in this dispensation? Such treatment will not retain those who join us. In future, keep your novices in your own quarters for a day or two, and only on the third day let them lodge out, taking care to acquaint yourself with their lodging.&rdquo; With this rider, the Teacher laid down the precept.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1167"></a><span class="t30">Gathering together in the Dhamma Hall, the monks spoke of the goodness of Rāhula. &ldquo;See, sirs, how anxious was Rāhula to observe the rules. When told to find his own lodging, he did not say, &lsquo;I am the son of the One with Ten Powers; what have you to do with quarters? You turn out!&rsquo; No; not a single monk did he oust, but quartered himself in the outhouse.&rdquo;</span><a id="a1168"></a><span class="t18"> [1.49] </span><span class="t30">As they were talking thus, the Teacher came to the Hall and took his seat on his throne of state, saying: &ldquo;What is the subject of your talk, monks?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;we were talking of the anxiety of Rāhula to keep the rules, nothing else.&rdquo; Then said the Teacher, &ldquo;This anxiety Rāhula has shown not only now, but also in the past, when he had been born an animal.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past a certain king of Magadha was reigning in Rājagaha; and in those days the Bodhisatta, having been born a stag, was living in the forest at the head of a herd of deer. Now his sister brought her son to him, saying: &ldquo;Monk, teach your nephew here the ruses of deer.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;go away now, my boy, and come back at such and such a time to be taught.&rdquo; Punctually, at the time his uncle mentioned, the young stag was there and received instruction in the ruses of deer.</p>
<p class="p7">One day as he was ranging the woods he was caught in a snare and uttered the plaintive cry of a captive. Away fled the herd and told the mother of her son&rsquo;s capture. She came to her brother and asked him whether his nephew had been taught the ruses of deer. &ldquo;Fear not; <span class="t18">{1.163}</span> your son is not at fault,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;He has learned thoroughly the deer&rsquo;s ruses, and will come back straightaway to your great rejoicing.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Migaṁ tipallattham-anekamāyaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Aṭṭhakkhuraṁ, aḍḍharattāpapāyiṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ekena sotena chamāssasanto,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Chahi kalāhitibhoti bhāgineyyo ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">The deer in three postures, with many tricks, using eight hoofs, and drinking at midnight, breathing through just one nostril on the ground, my nephew beats the hunter in six ways.</span><span class="t18">{1.164}</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a1169"></a>Thus did the Bodhisatta console his sister by showing her how thoroughly her son had mastered the ruses of deer. Meantime the young stag on being caught in the snare did not struggle, but lay down at full length<a id="a1170"></a><a href="notes.html#a14705"><span class="t9">{233}</span></a> on his side, with his legs stretched out taut and rigid. He pawed up the ground round his hoofs so as to shower the grass and earth about; relieved nature; let his head fall; lolled out his tongue; beslavered his body all over; swelled himself out by drawing in the wind; turned up his eyes; breathed only with the lower nostril, holding his breath with the upper one; and made himself generally so rigid and so stiff as to look like a corpse. Even the blue-bottles swarmed round him; and here and there crows settled.<a id="a1171"></a><span class="t18"> [1.50]</span></p>
<p class="p7">The hunter came up and smacked the stag on the belly with his hand, remarking, &ldquo;He must have been caught early this morning; he&rsquo;s going bad already.&rdquo; So saying, the man loosed the stag from his bonds, saying to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut him up here where he lies, and take the flesh home with me.&rdquo; But as the man guilelessly set to work to gather sticks and leaves (to make a fire with), the young stag rose to his feet, shook himself, stretched out his neck, and, like a little cloud scudding before a mighty wind, sped swiftly back to his mother.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After repeating what he had said as to Rāhula&rsquo;s having shown no less anxiety in time past to keep rules than in the present, the Teacher made the connection and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Rāhula was the young stag of those days, Uppalavaṇṇā his mother, and I the stag his uncle.&rdquo;</span></p>
