<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present a Devatā works to dissuade her landlord, Anāthapiṇḍika, from his allegiance to the Buddha, and is expelled from her home in his house for the trouble. When the Buddha hears of this he tells a story of how Māra, in a previous life, had tried to dissuade him from giving to a Paccekabuddha by making a fiery abyss appear between them. The Bodhisatta crossed over and made his gift anyway.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the wealthy man of Benares (Bārāṇasiseṭṭhi).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Gladly will I fall head-first.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [1.100]</span><a id="a1527"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about Anāthapiṇḍika.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">For Anāthapiṇḍika, who had lavished fifty-four crores on the dispensation of the Buddha over the monastery alone, and who valued naught else save only the Three Jewels, used to go every day while the Teacher was at Jetavana to attend the Great Services &ndash; once at daybreak, once after breakfast, and once in the evening. There were intermediate services too; but he never went empty-handed, for fear the novices and lads should look to see what he had brought with him. When he went in the early morning, </span><span class="t18">{1.227}</span><span class="t30"> he used to have rice-gruel taken up; after breakfast, ghee, butter, honey, molasses, and the like; and in the evening, he brought perfumes, garlands and cloths. So much did he expend day after day, that his expense knew no bounds. Moreover, many traders borrowed money from him on their bonds &ndash; to the amount of eighteen crores; and the great merchant never called the money in. Furthermore, another eighteen crores of the family property, which were buried in the riverbank, were washed out to sea, when the bank was swept away by a storm; and down rolled the brazen pots, with fastenings and seals unbroken, to the bottom of the ocean. In his house, too, there was always rice standing ready for 500 monks &ndash; so that the merchant&rsquo;s house was to the Saṅgha like a pool dug where four roads meet, yes, like mother and father was he to them. Therefore, even the Supreme Buddha used to go to his house, and the Eighty Chief Elders too; and the number of other monks passing in and out was beyond measure.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now his house was seven stories high and had seven portals; and over the fourth gateway dwelt a Devatā who was a heretic. When the Supreme Buddha came into the house, she could not stay in her abode on high, but came down with her children to the ground-floor; and she had to do the same whenever the Eighty Chief Elders or the other elders came in and out. Thought she, &ldquo;So long as the ascetic Gotama and his disciples keep coming into this house I can have no peace here; I can&rsquo;t be eternally coming downstairs to the ground floor. I must contrive to stop them from coming any more to this house.&rdquo; So one day, when the business manager had retired to rest, she appeared before him in visible shape.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1528"></a><span class="t30">&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;the Devatā who lives over the fourth gateway.&rdquo; &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see what the merchant is doing. Heedless of his own future, he is drawing upon his resources, only to enrich the ascetic Gotama. He engages in no commerce; he undertakes no business. Advise the merchant to attend to his business, and arrange that the ascetic Gotama with his disciples shall come no more into the house.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then said he, &ldquo;Foolish Devatā, if the merchant does spend his money, he spends it on the dispensation of the Buddha, which leads to safety. Even if he were to seize me by the hair and sell me for a slave, I will say nothing. Begone!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Another day, she went to the merchant&rsquo;s eldest son and gave him the same advice. And he flouted her in just the same manner. But to the merchant himself she did not so much as dare to speak on the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now by dint of unending munificence </span><span class="t18">{1.228}</span><span class="t30"> and of doing no business, the merchant&rsquo;s incomings diminished and his estate grew less and less; so that he sank by degrees into poverty, and his table, his dress, and his bed and food were no longer what they had once been. Yet, in spite of his altered circumstances, </span><a id="a1529"></a><span class="t18">[1.101]</span><a id="a1530"></a><span class="t30"> he continued to entertain the Saṅgha, though he was no longer able to feast them. So one day when he had made his bow and taken his seat, the Teacher said to him, &ldquo;Householder, are gifts being given at your house?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s only a little sour husk-porridge, left over from yesterday.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be not distressed, householder, at the thought that you can only offer what is unpalatable. If the heart be good, the food given to Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas,</span><a id="a1531"></a><a href="notes.html#a14766"><span class="t9">{262}</span></a><span class="t30"> and their disciples, cannot but be good too. And why? Because of the greatness of the fruit thereof. For he who can make his heart acceptable cannot give an unacceptable gift &ndash; as is to be testified by the following passage:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&ldquo;For, if the heart have faith, no gift is small</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">To Buddhas or to their disciples true.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&rsquo;Tis said no service can be reckoned small</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">That&rsquo;s paid to Buddhas, lords of great renown.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Mark well what fruit rewarded that poor gift</span></p>
<p class="p11"><a id="a1532"></a><span class="t31">Of pottage &ndash; dried-up, sour, and lacking salt.&rdquo;</span><a id="a1533"></a><a href="notes.html#a14768"><span class="t32">{263}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">Also, he said this further thing, &ldquo;Householder, in giving this unpalatable gift, you are giving it to those who have entered on the Noble Eightfold Path. Whereas I, when in Velāma&rsquo;s time I stirred up all Jambudīpa by giving the seven things of price, and in my largesse poured them forth as though I had made into one mighty stream the five great rivers &ndash; I yet found none who had reached the Three Refuges or kept the Five Precepts; for rare are those who are worthy of offerings. Therefore, let not your heart be troubled by the thought that your gift is unpalatable.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated the Velāmakasutta [AN 9.20].</span><a id="a1534"></a><a href="notes.html#a14770"><span class="t9">{264}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now that Devatā who had not dared to speak to the merchant in the days of his magnificence, thought that now he was poor he would hearken to her, and so, entering his chamber at dead of night she appeared before him in visible shape, standing in mid-air. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the merchant, when he became aware of her presence. &ldquo;I am the Devatā, great merchant, who dwells over the fourth gateway.&rdquo; &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;To give you counsel.&rdquo; &ldquo;Proceed, then.&rdquo; &ldquo;Great merchant, you take no thought for your own future or for your own children. You have expended vast sums on the dispensation of the ascetic Gotama; in fact, by long-continued </span><span class="t18">{1.229}</span><span class="t30"> expenditure and by not undertaking new business you have been brought by the ascetic Gotama to poverty. But even in your poverty you do not shake off the ascetic Gotama! The ascetics are in and out of your house this very day just the same! What they have had of you cannot be recovered. That may be taken for certain. But henceforth don&rsquo;t you go yourself to the ascetic Gotama and don&rsquo;t let his disciples set foot inside your house. Do not even turn to look at the ascetic Gotama but attend to your trade and traffic in order to restore the family estate.&rdquo; Then he said to her, &ldquo;Was this the counsel you wanted to give me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it was.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Said the merchant, &ldquo;The One with Ten Powers has made me proof against a hundred, a thousand, yes against a hundred thousand Devatās such as you are! My faith is strong and steadfast as Mount Sineru! My substance has been expended on the dispensation that leads to safety. Wicked are your words; it is a blow aimed at the dispensation of the Buddhas by you, you wicked and impudent wretch. I cannot live under the same roof with you; be off at once from my house and seek shelter elsewhere!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Hearing these words of that converted man and elect disciple, she could not stay, but repairing to her dwelling, took her </span><a id="a1535"></a><span class="t18">[1.102]</span><span class="t30"> children by the hand and went forth. But though she went, she was minded, if she could not find herself a lodging elsewhere, to appease the merchant and return to dwell in his house; and in this mind she went to the tutelary Devaputta of the city and with due salutation stood before him. Being asked what had brought her there, she said: &ldquo;My lord, I have been speaking imprudently to Anāthapiṇḍika, and he in his anger has turned me out of my home. Take me to him and make it up between us, so that he may let me live there again.&rdquo; &ldquo;But what was it you said to the merchant?&rdquo; &ldquo;I told him for the future not to support the Buddha and the Saṅgha, and not to let the ascetic Gotama set foot again in his house. This is what I said, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wicked were your words; it was a blow aimed at the dispensation. I cannot take you with me to the merchant.&rdquo; Meeting with no support from him, she went to the Four Great Kings of the world. And being repulsed by them in the same manner, she went on to Sakka, King of Devas, and told him her story, beseeching him still more earnestly, as follows, &ldquo;Deva, finding no shelter, I wander about homeless, leading my children by the hand. Grant me of your majesty some place wherein to dwell.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">And he too said to her, &ldquo;You have done wickedly; it was a blow aimed at the Conqueror&rsquo;s dispensation. I cannot speak to the merchant on your behalf. But I can tell you one way </span><span class="t18">{1.230}</span><span class="t30"> whereby the merchant may be led to pardon you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pray tell me, Deva.&rdquo; &ldquo;Men have had eighteen crores of the merchant on bonds. Take the semblance of his agent, and without telling anybody repair to their houses with the bonds, in the company of some young Yakkhas. Stand in the middle of their houses with the bond in one hand and a receipt in the other, and terrify them with your Yakkha power, saying, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your acknowledgment of the debt. Our merchant did not move in the matter while he was affluent; but now he is poor, and you must pay up the money you owe.&rsquo; By your Yakkha power obtain all those eighteen crores of gold and fill the merchant&rsquo;s empty treasuries. He had another treasure buried in the banks of the river Aciravatī, but when the bank was washed away, the treasure was swept into the sea. Get that back also by your supernatural power and store it in his treasuries. Further, there is another sum of eighteen crores lying unowned in such and such a place. Bring that too and pour the money into his empty treasuries. When you have atoned by the recovery of these fifty-four crores, ask the merchant to forgive you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good, Deva,&rdquo; said she. And she set to work obediently, and did just as she had been bidden. When she had recovered all the money, she went into the merchant&rsquo;s chamber at dead of night and appeared before him in visible shape standing in the air.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The merchant asking who was there, she replied, &ldquo;It is I, great merchant, the blind and foolish Devatā who lived over your fourth gateway. In the greatness of my infatuate folly I knew not the virtues of a Buddha, and so came to say what I said to you some days ago. Pardon me my fault! At the instance of Sakka, King of Devas, I have made atonement by recovering the eighteen crores owing to you, the eighteen crores which had been washed down into the sea, and another eighteen crores which were lying unowned in such and such a place &ndash; making fifty-four crores in all, which I have poured into your empty treasure-chambers. The sum you expended on the monastery at Jetavana is now made up again. While I have nowhere to dwell, I am in misery. Bear not in mind what I did in my ignorant folly, great merchant, but pardon me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Anāthapiṇḍika, hearing what she said, thought to himself, &ldquo;She is a Devatā, and she says she has atoned, and confesses her fault. The Teacher shall consider this and make his virtues known to her. I will take her before the Supreme Buddha.&rdquo; So he said: &ldquo;My good Devatā, if you want me to pardon you, ask me in the presence of the master.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will. Take me along with you to the Teacher.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he. And early in the morning, when night was just passing away, he took her with him to the Teacher, and told the Tathāgata all that she had done.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Hearing this, the Teacher said: &ldquo;You see, householder, how the defiled man regards defilement </span><span class="t18">{1.231}</span><a id="a1536"></a><a id="a1537"></a><span class="t30"> as excellent before it ripens to its fruit. But when it has ripened, then he sees defilements to be defiled. Likewise the good man looks on his goodness </span><a id="a1538"></a><span class="t18">[1.103]</span><a id="a1539"></a><span class="t30"> as wrong before it ripens to its fruit; but when it ripens, he sees it to be goodness.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated these two verses from the Dhammapada [119-120]:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><a id="a1540"></a><span class="t31">&ldquo;The defiled man thinks his deed is good,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><a id="a1541"></a><span class="t31">So long as wrong has ripened not to fruit.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">But when his wrong at last to ripeness grows,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">The defiled man sees &lsquo;It was wrong I wrought.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">The good man thinks his goodness is but wrong,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">So long as it has ripened not to fruit.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">But when his goodness unto ripeness grows,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><a id="a1542"></a><span class="t31">The good man sees that &lsquo;It was good I wrought.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">At the close of these verses that Devatā was established in the Fruit of the First Path. She fell at the wheel-marked feet of the Teacher, crying, &ldquo;Stained as I was with passion, depraved by defilements, misled by delusion, and blinded by ignorance, I spoke wickedly because I knew not your virtues. Pardon me!&rdquo; Then she received pardon from the Teacher and from the great merchant.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At this time Anāthapiṇḍika sang his own praises in the Teacher&rsquo;s presence, saying: &ldquo;Sir, though this Devatā did her best to stop me from giving support to the Buddha and his following, she could not succeed; and though she tried to stop me from giving gifts, yet I gave them still! Was not this goodness on my part?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Said the Teacher, &ldquo;You, householder, are a converted man and an elect disciple; your faith is firm and your vision is purified. No marvel then that you were not stopped by this impotent Devatā. The marvel was that the wise and good of a bygone day, when a Buddha had not appeared, and when knowledge had not ripened to its full fruit, should from the heart of a lotus-flower have given gifts, although Māra, lord of the Sensual Worlds, appeared in mid-heaven, shouting, &lsquo;If you give gifts, you shall be roasted in this hell,&rsquo; and showing them therewithal a pit eighty cubits deep, filled with red-hot embers.&rdquo; And so saying, at the request of Anāthapiṇḍika, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life in the family of the Lord High Treasurer of Benares, and was brought up in the lap of all luxury like a royal prince. By the time he was come to years of discretion, being barely sixteen years old, he had made himself perfect in all accomplishments. At his father&rsquo;s death he filled the office of Lord High Treasurer, and built six alms halls, one at each of the four gates of the city, one in the centre of the city, and one at the gate of his own mansion. Very bountiful was he, <span class="t18">{1.232}</span> and he kept the Precepts, and observed the Uposatha duties.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day at breakfast-time when dainty fare of exquisite taste and variety was being brought in for the Bodhisatta, a Paccekabuddha rising from a seven days&rsquo; trance of Absorption, and noticing that it was time to go his rounds, bethought him that it would be well to visit the Treasurer of Benares that morning. So he cleaned his teeth with a tooth-stick made from the betel-vine, washed his mouth with water from Lake Anotatta, put on his under-robe as he stood on the tableland of Manosilā, fastened on his girdle, donned his outer-robe; and, equipped with a bowl <a id="a1543"></a><span class="t18">[1.104]</span> which he called into being by his Supernormal Powers, he passed through the air and arrived at the gate of the mansion just as the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s breakfast was taken in.</p>
<p class="p7">As soon as the Bodhisatta became aware of his presence there, he rose at once from his seat and looked at the attendant, indicating that a service was required. &ldquo;What am I to do, my lord?&rdquo; &ldquo;Bring his reverence&rsquo;s bowl,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p class="p7">At that very instant Māra the Wicked rose up in a state of great excitement, saying: &ldquo;It is seven days since the Paccekabuddha had food given him; if he gets none today, he will perish. I will destroy him and stop the Treasurer from giving also.&rdquo; And that very instant he went and called into being within the mansion a pit of red-hot embers, eighty cubits deep, filled with Acacia-charcoal, all ablaze and aflame like the great hell of Avīci. When he had created this pit, Māra himself took his stand in mid-air.</p>
<p class="p7">When the man who was on his way to fetch the bowl became aware of this, he was terrified and started back. &ldquo;What makes you start back, my man?&rdquo; asked the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a great pit of red-hot embers blazing and flaming in the middle of the house.&rdquo; And as man after man got to the spot, they all were panic-stricken, and ran away as fast as their legs would carry them.</p>
<p class="p7">Thought the Bodhisatta to himself, &ldquo;Māra, the Enthraller, must have been exerting himself today to stop me from alms-giving. I have yet to learn, however, that I am to be shaken by a hundred, or by a thousand, Māras. We will see this day whose strength is the stronger, whose might is the mightier, mine or Māra&rsquo;s.&rdquo; So taking in his own hand the bowl which stood ready, he passed out from the house, and, standing on the brink of the fiery pit, looked up to the heavens. Seeing Māra, he said: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am Māra,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Did you call into being this pit of red-hot embers?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{1.233}</span> &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;To stop you from alms-giving and to destroy the life of that Paccekabuddha.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will not permit you either to stop me from my alms-giving or to destroy the life of the Paccekabuddha. I am going to see today whether your strength or mine is the greater.&rdquo; And still standing on the brink of that fiery pit, he cried, &ldquo;Venerable Paccekabuddha, even though I fall headlong into this pit of red-hot embers, I will not turn back. Only vouchsafe to take the food I bring.&rdquo; And so saying he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Kāmaṁ patāmi nirayaṁ uddhampādo avaṁsiro,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nānariyaṁ karissāmi, handa piṇḍaṁ paṭiggahā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Gladly will I fall headfirst, or fall head over heels into hell, but I will not do anything ignoble, come, accept this rice.</span></p>
<p class="p23">With these words the Bodhisatta, grasping the bowl of food, strode on with undaunted resolution right on to the surface of the pit of fire. But <a id="a1544"></a><span class="t18">[1.105]</span> even as he did so, there rose up to the surface through all the eighty cubits of the pit&rsquo;s depth a large and peerless lotus-flower, which received the feet of the Bodhisatta! And from it there came a measure of pollen which fell on the head of the Great Being, so that his whole body was as it were sprinkled from head to foot with dust of gold! Standing right in the heart of the lotus, he poured the dainty food into the bowl of the Paccekabuddha.</p>
<p class="p7">And when the latter had taken the food and returned thanks, he flung his bowl aloft into the heavens, and right in the sight of all the people he himself rose bodily into the air likewise, and passed away to the Himālayas again, seeming to tread a track formed of clouds fantastically shaped.</p>
<p class="p7">And Māra, too, defeated and dejected, passed away back to his own abode.</p>
<p class="p7">But the Bodhisatta, still standing in the lotus, preached <span class="t18">{1.234}</span> the Dhamma to the people, extolling alms-giving and the Precepts; after which, girt round by the escorting multitude, he passed into his own mansion once more. And all his life long he showed generosity and did other good works, till in the end he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Said the Teacher, &ldquo;It was no marvel, layman, that you, with your discernment of the truth, were not overcome now by the Devatā; the real marvel was what the wise and good did in bygone days.&rdquo; His lesson ended, the Teacher showed the connection, and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The Paccekabuddha of those days passed away, never to be born again. I was myself the Treasurer of Benares who, defeating Māra, and standing in the heart of the lotus, placed alms in the bowl of the Paccekabuddha.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a1551"></a><span class="t15">In the present Ven. Sāriputta comes across a poor boy and ordains him, but, as in his lay life, he is very unfortunate and can hardly get enough alms to eat, but yet he does become an Arahat. The Buddha tells a story of the past, during which a man had become jealous of an Arahat, and prevented him from receiving food in an attempt to drive him away. Everywhere he was born from there on he was unfortunate. And when in his last life he meditated on the three characteristics, he won release. This story includes a telling of the Mindavindaka story, which occurs several times in these Jātakas.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;He who does not take the advice.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about the elder Losakatissa.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&lsquo;Who,&rsquo; you ask, &lsquo;was this elder Losakatissa?&rsquo; Well; his father was a fisherman in Kosala, and he was the bane of his family; and, when a monk, never had anything given to him. His previous existence ended, he had been conceived by a certain fisherman&rsquo;s wife in a fishing-village of a thousand families in Kosala. And on the day he was conceived all those thousand families, net in hand, went fishing in river and pool but failed to catch one single fish; and </span><a id="a1554"></a><span class="t18">[1.106]</span><span class="t30"> the like bad fortune dogged them from that day forward. Also, before his birth, the village was destroyed seven times by fire, and visited seven times by the king&rsquo;s vengeance. So in time it came to pass that the people fell into a wretched plight.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Reflecting that such had not been their lot in former days, but that now they were going to rack and ruin, they concluded that there must be some breeder of misfortune among them, and resolved to divide into two bands. This they did; and there were then two bands of five hundred families each. Thence-forward, ruin dogged the band which included the parents of the future Losaka, while the other five hundred families throve apace. So the former resolved to go on halving their numbers, and did so, until this one family was parted from all the rest. Then they knew that the breeder of misfortune was in that family, and with blows drove them away. </span><span class="t18">{1.235}</span></p>

(He that is born into his last existence cannot be killed. For like a lamp within a jar, even so securely within his breast burns the flame of his destiny to become an Arahat.) The mother took care of the child till he could run about, and when he could run about then she put a potsherd in his hands, and, bidding him go into a house to beg, ran away. Thenceforward, the solitary child used to beg his food thereabouts and sleep where he could. He was unwashed and unkempt, and made a living after the fashion of a mud-eating Yakkha.</span><a id="a1556"></a><a href="notes.html#a14772"><span class="t9">{265}</span></a><span class="t30"> When he was seven years old, he was picking up and eating, like a crow, lump by lump, any rice he could find outside a house door where they flung away the rinsings of the rice-pots.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Sāriputta, Captain of the Dhamma, going into Sāvatthi on his round for alms, noticed the child, and, wondering what village the hapless creature came from, was filled with love for him and called out, &ldquo;Come here.&rdquo; The child came, bowed to the elder, and stood before him. Then said Sāriputta, &ldquo;What village do you belong to, and where are your parents?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;I am destitute, sir,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;for my parents said they were tired out, and so forsook me, and went away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Would you like to become a monk?&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed I should, sir; but who would receive a poor wretch like me into the Saṅgha?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, pray let me become a monk.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1557"></a><span class="t30">The elder gave the child a meal and took him to the monastery, washed him with his own hands, and admitted him a novice first and a full monk afterwards, when he was old enough. In his old age he was known as elder Losakatissa; he was always unlucky,</span><a id="a1558"></a><a href="notes.html#a14774"><span class="t9">{266}</span></a><span class="t30"> and but little was given to him. The story goes that, no matter how lavish the generosity, he never got enough to eat, but only just enough to keep himself alive. A single ladle of rice seemed to fill his alms-bowl to the brim, so that the charitable thought his bowl was full and bestowed the rest of their rice on the next. When rice was being put into his bowl, it is said that the rice in the giver&rsquo;s dish used to vanish away. And so with every kind of food. Even when, as time went by, he had developed Discernment and so won the highest fruit which is Arahatship, he still got but little.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1559"></a><span class="t30">In the fullness of time, when the materials which determined his separate existence</span><a id="a1560"></a><a href="notes.html#a14776"><span class="t9">{267}</span></a><span class="t30"> were outworn, the day came for him to pass away. And the captain </span><a id="a1561"></a><span class="t18">[1.107]</span><span class="t30"> of the Dhamma, as he meditated, had knowledge of this, and thought to himself, &lsquo;Losakatissa will pass away today; and today at any rate I will see that he has enough to eat.&rsquo; So he took the elder and came to Sāvatthi for alms. But, because Losaka was with him, it was all in vain that Sāriputta held out his hand for alms in populous Sāvatthi; not so much as a reverential bow was vouchsafed him. So he bade the elder go back and seat himself in the sitting-hall of the monastery, and collected food which he sent with a message </span><span class="t18">{1.236}</span><span class="t30"> that it was to be given to Losaka. Those to whom he gave it took the food and went their way, but, forgetting all about Losaka, ate it themselves. So when Sāriputta rose up, and was entering the monastery, Losaka came to him and saluted him. Sāriputta stopped, and turning round said: &ldquo;Well, did you get the food, monk?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1562"></a><span class="t30">&ldquo;I shall, no doubt, get it in good time,&rdquo; said the elder. Sāriputta was greatly troubled, and looked to see what hour it was. But noon was passed.</span><a id="a1563"></a><a href="notes.html#a14778"><span class="t9">{268}</span></a><a id="a1564"></a><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Stay here, monk,&rdquo; said Sāriputta, &ldquo;and do not move,&rdquo; and he made Losakatissa sit down in the sitting-hall, and set out for the palace of the king of Kosala. The king bade his bowl be taken, and saying that it was past noon and therefore not the time to eat rice, ordered his bowl to be filled with the four sweet kinds of food.</span><a id="a1565"></a><a href="notes.html#a14780"><span class="t9">{269}</span></a><span class="t30"> With this he returned, and stood before him, bowl in hand, bidding the sage eat. But the elder was ashamed, because of the reverence he had towards Ven. Sāriputta, and would not eat. &ldquo;Come, monk Tissa,&rdquo; said Sāriputta, &ldquo; &rsquo;tis I must stand with the bowl; sit you down and eat. If the bowl left my hand, everything in it would vanish away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So the venerable elder Losakatissa ate the sweets, while the exalted Captain of the Dhamma stood holding the bowl; and thanks to the latter&rsquo;s merits and efficacy the food did not vanish. So the elder Losakatissa ate as much as he wanted and was satisfied, and that self-same day passed away by that death whereby existence ceases for ever.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Supreme Buddha stood by, and saw the body burned; and they built a shrine for the collected ashes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Seated in a meeting in the Dhamma Hall, the monks said: &ldquo;Monks, Losaka was unlucky, and little was given to him. How came he with his unluck and his neediness to win the glory of Arahatship?&rdquo; Entering the Hall, the Teacher asked what they were talking about; and they told him. &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this monk&rsquo;s own actions were the cause both of his receiving so little, and of his becoming an Arahat. In bygone days he had prevented others from receiving, and that is why he received so little himself. But it was by his meditating on suffering, impermanence, and the absence of an abiding self in things, that he became an Arahat for himself.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1566"></a>In the past, in the days of Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, there was a monk who lived the village life and was maintained by a country householder. He was regular in his conduct as a monk,<a id="a1567"></a><a href="notes.html#a14782"><span class="t9">{270}</span></a> virtuous in his life, and was filled to overflowing with insight. There was also an elder, an Arahat, who lived with his fellows on terms of equality, and at the time of the story paid a first visit to the village where lived the householder who supported <a id="a1568"></a><span class="t18">[1.108]</span> this monk. So pleased was the householder <span class="t18">{1.237}</span> with the very demeanour of the elder that, taking his bowl, he led him into the house and with every mark of respect invited him to eat. Then he listened to a short discourse by the elder, and at its close said, with a bow, &ldquo;Sir, pray do not journey further than our monastery close by; in the evening I will come and call upon you there.&rdquo; So the elder went to the monastery, saluting the resident monk on his entrance; and, first courteously asking leave, took a seat by his side. The monk received him with all friendliness, and asked whether any food had been given him as alms.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; replied the elder. &ldquo;Where, pray?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, in your village close by, at the householder&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; And so saying, the elder asked to be shown his cell and made it ready. Then laying aside his bowl and robe, and seating himself, he became absorbed in blissful Insight and enjoyed the bliss of the Fruits of the Paths.</p>
<p class="p7">In the evening came the householder, with servants carrying flowers and perfumes and lamps and oil. Saluting the resident monk, he asked whether a guest had appeared, an elder. Being told that he had, the householder asked where he was and learned which cell had been given him. Then the householder went to the elder and, first bowing courteously, seated himself by the elder&rsquo;s side and listened to a discourse. In the cool of the evening the householder made his offerings at the Stūpa and Bodhi tree, lit his lamp, and departed with an invitation to both elder and monk to come up to his house next day for their meal.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m losing my hold on the householder,&rdquo; thought the monk. &ldquo;If this elder stays, I shall count for nothing with him.&rdquo; So he was discontented and fell to scheming how to make the elder see that he must not settle down there for good. Accordingly, when the elder came to pay his respects in the early morning, the monk did not open his lips. The Arahat read the other&rsquo;s thoughts and said to himself, &ldquo;This monk knows not that I shall never stand in his light either with the family that supports him or with his Saṅgha.&rdquo; And going back to his cell, he became absorbed in the bliss of Absorption, and in the bliss of the fruits.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1569"></a>Next day, the resident monk, having first knocked gingerly on the gong,<a id="a1570"></a><a href="notes.html#a14785"><span class="t9">{271}</span></a> and having tapped on the gong with the back of his nail, went off alone to the householder&rsquo;s house. Taking from him his alms-bowl, the householder bade him be seated and asked where the stranger was.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I know no news of your friend,&rdquo; said the monk. &ldquo;Though I knocked on the gong and tapped at his door, I couldn&rsquo;t wake him. I can <a id="a1571"></a><span class="t18">[1.109]</span> only presume that his dainty fare <span class="t18">{1.238}</span> here yesterday has disagreed with him and that he is still in bed in consequence. Possibly such doings may commend themselves to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">(Meantime the Arahat, who had waited till the time came to go his round for alms, had washed and dressed and risen with bowl and robe in the air and gone elsewhere.)</p>
<p class="p7">The householder gave the monk rice and milk to eat, with ghee and sugar and honey in it. Then he had his bowl scoured with perfumed chunam powder and filled afresh, saying: &ldquo;Sir, the elder must be fatigued with his journey; take him this.&rdquo; Without demur the monk took the food and went his way, thinking to himself, &ldquo;If our friend once gets a taste of this, taking him by the throat and kicking him out of doors won&rsquo;t get rid of him. But how can I get rid of it? If I give it away to a human being, it will be known. If I throw it into the water, the ghee will float on top. And as for throwing it away on the ground, that will only bring all the crows of the district flocking to the spot.&rdquo; In his perplexity his eye fell on a field that had been fired, and, scraping out the embers, he flung the contents of his bowl into the hole, filled in the embers on the top, and went off home. Not finding the elder there, he thought that the Arahat had understood his jealousy and departed. &ldquo;Woe is me,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;for my greed has made me to wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And thenceforth sore affliction befell him and he became like a living ghost. Dying soon after, he was reborn in hell and there was tormented for hundreds of thousands of years. By reason of his ripening defilements, in five hundred successive births he was a Yakkha and never had enough to eat, except one day when he enjoyed a surfeit of offal. Next, for five hundred more existences he was a dog, and here too, only on one single day had his fill &ndash; of a vomit of rice; on no other occasion did he have enough to eat.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1572"></a>Even when he ceased to be a dog, he was only born into a beggar family in a Kāsi village. From the hour of his birth, that family became still more beggared, and he never got half as much water-gruel as he wanted. And he was called Mittavindaka. <span class="t18">{1.239}</span><a id="a1573"></a> <a id="a1574"></a>Unable at last to endure the pangs of hunger<a id="a1575"></a><a href="notes.html#a14787"><span class="t9">{272}</span></a> that now beset them, his father and mother beat him and drove him away, crying, &ldquo;Begone, you curse!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">In the course of his wanderings, the little outcaste came to Benares, where in those days the Bodhisatta was a teacher of world-wide fame with five hundred young brahmins to teach. In those times the Benares folk used to give day by day commons of food to poor lads and had them taught free, and so this Mittavindaka also became a scholar supported by the Bodhisatta. But he was fierce and intractable, always fighting with his fellows <a id="a1576"></a><span class="t18">[1.110]</span> and heedless of his master&rsquo;s reproofs; and so the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s fees fell off. And as he quarrelled so, and would not brook reproof, the youth ended by running away, and came to a border-village where he hired himself out for a living, and married a miserably poor woman by whom he had two children. Later, the villagers paid him to teach them what was the true teaching and what was false, and gave him a hut to live in at the entrance to their village. But, all because of Mittavindaka&rsquo;s coming to live among them, the king&rsquo;s vengeance fell seven times on those villagers, and seven times were their homes burned to the ground; seven times too did their water-tank dry up.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1577"></a><a id="a1578"></a>Then they considered the matter and agreed that it was not so with them before Mittavindaka&rsquo;s coming, but that ever since he came they had been going from bad to worse. So with blows they drove him from their village; and forth he went with his family, and came to a haunted forest. And there the Amanussas killed and ate his wife and children. Fleeing thence, he came after many wanderings to a village on the coast called Gambhīra, arriving on a day when a ship was putting to sea; and he hired himself for service aboard. For a week the ship held on her way, but on the seventh day she came to a complete standstill in mid-ocean, as though she had run upon a rock. Then they cast lots, in order to rid them of their bane; and seven times the lot fell on Mittavindaka. So they gave him a raft of bamboos, and laying hold of him, cast him overboard. And forthwith the ship made way again. <span class="t18">{1.240}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1579"></a><a id="a1580"></a>Mittavindaka clambered on to his bamboos and floated on the waves. Thanks to his having obeyed the Precepts in the times of the Buddha Kassapa, he found in mid-ocean four Devadhītā dwelling in a palace of crystal, with whom he dwelt happily for seven days. Now palace-ghosts [vimānapeta] enjoy happiness only for seven days at a time; and so, when the seventh day came and they had to depart to their punishment, they left him with an injunction to await their return. But no sooner were they departed, than Mittavindaka put off on his raft again and came to where eight Devadhītā dwelt in a palace of silver. Leaving them in turn, he came to where sixteen Devadhītā dwelt in a palace of jewels, and thereafter to where thirty-two dwelt in a palace of gold. Paying no regard to their words, again he sailed away and came to a city of Yakkhas, set among islands. And there a Yakkhini was ranging about in the shape of a goat. Not knowing that she was a Yakkhini, Mittavindaka thought to make a meal of the goat, and seized hold of the creature by the leg. Straightaway, by virtue of her Yakkha-nature, she hurled him up and away over the ocean, and down he fell in a thorn-brake on the slopes of the dry moat of Benares, and from there rolled to earth.</p>
<p class="p7">Now it chanced that at that time thieves used to frequent that moat <a id="a1581"></a><span class="t18">[1.111]</span> and kill the king&rsquo;s goats; and the goatherds had bidden themselves nearby to catch the rascals.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1582"></a>Mittavindaka picked himself up and saw the goats. Thought he to himself, &ldquo;Well, it was a goat in an island in the ocean that, being seized by the leg, hurled me here over seas. Perhaps, if I do the same by one of these goats, I may get hurled back again to where the Devadhītā dwell in their ocean palaces.&rdquo; So, without thinking, he seized one of the goats by the leg. At once the goat began to bleat, and the goatherds came running up from every side. They laid hold of him at once, crying, &ldquo;This is the thief that has so long lived on the king&rsquo;s goats.&rdquo; And they, beat him and began to haul him away in bonds to the king.</p>
<p class="p7">Just at that time the Bodhisatta, with his five hundred young brahmins round him, was coming out of the city to bathe. Seeing and recognising Mittavindaka, he said to the goatherds, &ldquo;Why, this is a pupil of mine, my good men; what have you seized him for?&rdquo; &ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we caught this thief in the act of seizing a goat by the leg, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve got hold of him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; <span class="t18">{1.241}</span> said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;suppose you hand him over to us to live with us as our slave.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; replied the men, and letting their prisoner go, they went their way. Then the Bodhisatta asked Mittavindaka where he had been all that long time; and Mittavindaka told him all that he had done.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo; &rsquo;Tis through not hearkening to those who wished him well,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;that he has suffered all these misfortunes.&rdquo; And he recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Yo atthakāmassa hitānukampino</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ovajjamāno na karoti sāsanaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ajiyā pādam-olamba Mittako viya socatī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">He who does not take the advice of one who seeks his good, though taught by those concerned for his welfare, grieve like Mittaka holding onto the goat&rsquo;s foot.</span></p>
<p class="p23">And in those times both that Teacher and Mittavindaka passed away, and their lot thereafter was according to their deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1583"></a><a id="a1584"></a><span class="t30">Said the Teacher, &ldquo;This Losaka was himself the cause both of his getting little and of his getting Arahatship.&rdquo; His lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The elder Losakatissa was the Mittavindaka of those days, and I the Teacher of world-wide fame.&rdquo;</span><a id="a1585"></a><a href="notes.html#a14789"><span class="t9">{273}</span></a></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t34">He was, it was said, greedy after the Buddhist requisites and casting off all duties of master and pastor, entered Sāvatthi quite early, and after drinking excellent rice-gruel served with many a kind of solid food in the house of Visākhā, and after eating in the daytime various dainties, paddy, meat and boiled rice, not satisfied with this he went about thence</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t34">to the house of Culla Anāthapiṇḍika, and the king of Kosala, and various others.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">But on this occasion the monks told the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;Sir, this monk is greedy.&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Is it true </span><span class="t18">{1.242}</span><span class="t30"> as they say, monk, that you are greedy?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;So too in bygone days, monk, you were greedy, and by reason of your greediness lost your life; also you caused the wise and good to lose their home.&rdquo; And so saying he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a pigeon. Now the Benares folk of those days, as an act of goodness, used to hang up straw-baskets in divers places for the shelter and comfort of the birds; and the cook of the Lord High Treasurer of Benares hung up one of these baskets in his kitchen. In this basket the Bodhisatta took up his abode, sallying out at daybreak in quest of food, and returning home in the evening; and so he lived his life.</p>
<p class="p7">But one day a crow, flying over the kitchen, sniffed the goodly savour from the salt and fresh fish and meat there, and was filled with longing to taste it. Casting about how to have his will, he perched nearby, and at evening saw the Bodhisatta come home and go into the kitchen. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;I can manage it through the pigeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So back he came next day at dawn, and, when the Bodhisatta sallied out in quest of food, kept following him about from place to place like his shadow. So the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;Why do you keep with me, friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; answered the crow, &ldquo;your demeanour has won my admiration; and henceforth it is my wish to follow you.&rdquo; &ldquo;But your kind of food and mine, friend, is not the same,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;you will be hard put to it if you attach yourself to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said the crow, &ldquo;when you are seeking your food, I will feed too, by your side.&rdquo; &ldquo;So be it, then,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;only you must be earnest.&rdquo; And with this admonition to the crow, the Bodhisatta ranged about pecking up grass-seeds; while the other went about turning over cowdung and picking <a id="a1599"></a><span class="t18">[1.113]</span> out the insects underneath till he had got his fill. Then back he came to the Bodhisatta and remarked, &ldquo;My lord, you give too much time to eating; excess therein should be shunned.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And when the Bodhisatta had fed and reached home again at evening, in flew the crow with him into the kitchen. <span class="t18">{1.243}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why, our bird has brought another home with him,&rdquo; exclaimed the cook, and hung up a second basket for the crow. And from that time onward the two birds dwelt together in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day the Lord High Treasurer had in a store of fish which the cook hung up about the kitchen. Filled with greedy longing at the sight, the crow made up his mind to stay at home next day and treat himself to this excellent fare.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1600"></a>So all the night long he lay groaning away; and next day, when the Bodhisatta was starting in search of food, and cried, &ldquo;Come along, friend crow,&rdquo; the crow replied, &ldquo;Go without me, my lord; for I have a pain in my stomach.&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; answered the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;I never heard of crows having pains in their stomachs before. True, crows feel faint in each of the three night-watches; but if they eat a lamp-wick, their hunger is appeased for the moment. You must be hankering after the fish in the kitchen here. Come now, man&rsquo;s food will not agree with you. Do not give way like this, but come and seek your food with me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed, I am not able, my lord,&rdquo; said the crow. &ldquo;Well, your own conduct will show,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;Only fall not a prey to greed, but stand steadfast.&rdquo; And with this exhortation, away he flew to find his daily food.</p>
<p class="p7">The cook took several kinds of fish, and dressed some one way, some another. Then lifting the lids off his saucepans a little to let the steam out, he put a colander on the top of one and went outside the door, where he stood wiping the sweat from his brow. Just at that moment out popped the crow&rsquo;s head from the basket. A glance told him that the cook was away, and, &ldquo;Now or never,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;is my time. The only question is shall I choose minced meat or a big lump?&rdquo; Arguing that it takes a long time to make a full meal of minced meat, he resolved to take a large piece of fish and sit and eat it in his basket. So out he flew and alighted on the colander. &ldquo;Click&rdquo; went the colander.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What can that be?&rdquo; said the cook, running in on hearing the noise. Seeing the crow, he cried, &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s that rascally crow wanting to eat my master&rsquo;s dinner. I have to work for my master, not for that rascal! What&rsquo;s he to me, I should like to know?&rdquo; So, first shutting the door, he caught the crow and plucked every feather <span class="t18">{1.244}</span> off his body. Then, he pounded up ginger with salt and cumin, and mixed in sour buttermilk &ndash; finally sousing the crow in the pickle and flinging him back into his <a id="a1601"></a><span class="t18">[1.114]</span> basket. And there the crow lay groaning, overcome by the agony of his pain.</p>
<p class="p7">At evening the Bodhisatta came back, and saw the wretched plight of the crow. &ldquo;Ah! Greedy crow,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you would not heed my words, and now your own greed has worked you woe.&rdquo; So saying, he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Yo atthakāmassa, hitānukampino</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;He who does not take the advice.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a certain wilful monk. For the Fortunate One asked him whether the report was true that he was wilful, and the monk admitted that it was. &ldquo;Monk,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;this is not the first time you have been wilful: you were just so in former days also, </span><span class="t18">{1.245}</span><span class="t30"> and, as the result of your refusal to follow the advice of the wise and good, you met your end by the bite of a snake.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a wealthy family in the kingdom of Kāsi. Having come to years of discretion, he saw how from passion springs pain and how true bliss comes by the abandonment of passion. So he threw off sensual desires, and going forth to the Himālayas became an ascetic, winning by focusing on the Meditation Object the five <a id="a1609"></a><span class="t18">[1.115]</span> Super Knowledges and the eight Attainments. And as he lived his life in the bliss of Absorption, he came in after times to have a large following of five hundred ascetics, whose teacher he was.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1610"></a>Now one day a young poisonous viper, wandering about as vipers do, came to the hut of one of the ascetics; and that monk grew as fond of the creature as if it were his own child, housing it in a joint of bamboo and showing kindness to it. And because it was lodged in a joint of bamboo, the viper was known by the name of &ldquo;Veḷuka [Bamboo].&rdquo; Moreover, because the ascetic was as fond of the viper as if it were his own child, they called him &ldquo;Veḷuka&rsquo;s Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Hearing that one of the monks was keeping a viper, the Bodhisatta sent for that monk and asked whether the report was true. When told that it was true, the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;A viper can never be trusted; keep it no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; urged the monk, &ldquo;my viper is as dear to me as a pupil to a teacher; I could not live without him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; answered the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;know that this very snake will lose you your life.&rdquo; But heedless of the master&rsquo;s warning, that monk still kept the pet he could not bear to part with. Only a very few days later all the monks went out to gather fruits, and coming to a spot where all kinds grew in plenty, they stayed there two or three days. With them went Veḷuka&rsquo;s father, leaving his viper behind in its bamboo prison. Two or three days afterwards, when he came back, he bethought him of feeding the creature, and, opening the cane, stretched out his hand, saying: &ldquo;Come, my son; you must be hungry.&rdquo; But angry with his long fast, the viper bit his outstretched hand, killing him on the spot, and made its escape into the forest.</p>
<p class="p7">Seeing him lying there dead, the monks came and told the Bodhisatta, <span class="t18">{1.246}</span> who bade the body be burned. Then, seated in their midst, he exhorted the monks by repeating this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Yo atthakāmassa, hitānukampino</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ovajjamāno na karoti sāsanaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Evaṁ so nihato seti, Veḷukassa yathā pitā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">He who does not take the advice of one who seeks his good, though taught by those concerned for his welfare, are in this way destroyed, like Veḷuka&rsquo;s father.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus did the Bodhisatta exhort his followers; and he developed within himself the four Divine Abidings, and at his death was reborn into the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Monk, this is not the first time you have shown yourself wilful; you were no less so in times gone by, and thereby met your death from a viper&rsquo;s bite.&rdquo; Having ended his lesson, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;In those days, this wilful monk was Veḷuka&rsquo;s father, my disciples were the band of disciples, and I myself their teacher.&rdquo;</span></p>

Tradition says that, after travelling from Sāvatthi to the kingdom of Magadha, the Tathāgata was on his rounds in that kingdom when he arrived at a certain hamlet, which was thronged with fools. In this hamlet these fools met together one day, and debated together, saying: &ldquo;Friends, when we are at work in the jungle, the mosquitos devour us; and that hinders our work. Let us, arming ourselves with bows and weapons, go to war with the mosquitos and shoot them all to death.&rdquo; So off to the jungle they went, and shouting, &ldquo;Shoot down the mosquitos,&rdquo; shot and struck one another, till they were in a sad state and returned only to sink on the ground in or within the village or at its entrance.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks, the Teacher came in quest of alms to that village. The sensible minority among the inhabitants no sooner than they saw the Fortunate One, than they erected a pavilion at the entrance to their village and, after bestowing large alms on the </span><span class="t18">{1.247}</span><span class="t30"> Saṅgha with the Buddha at its head, bowed to the Teacher and seated themselves. Observing wounded men lying around on this side and on that, the Teacher asked those lay brothers, saying: &ldquo;There are numbers of handicapped men about; what has happened to them?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;they went forth to war with the mosquitos, but only shot one another and so handicapped themselves.&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;This is not the first time that these foolish people have dealt out blows to themselves instead of to the mosquitos they meant to kill; in former times, also, there were those who, meaning to hit a mosquito, hit a fellow-creature instead.&rdquo; And so saying, at those villagers&rsquo; request he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta gained his livelihood as a trader. In those days in a border-village in Kāsi there dwelt a number of carpenters. And it chanced that one of them, a bald grey-haired man, was planing away at some wood, with his head glistening like a copper bowl, when a mosquito settled on his scalp and stung him with its dart-like sting.</p>
<p class="p7">Said the carpenter to his son, who was seated nearby, &ldquo;My boy, there&rsquo;s a mosquito stinging me on the head; do drive it away.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hold still then, father,&rdquo; said the son, &ldquo;one blow will settle it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">(At that very time the Bodhisatta had reached that village in the way of trade, and was sitting in the carpenter&rsquo;s shop.)</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Rid me of it,&rdquo; cried the father. &ldquo;All right, father,&rdquo; answered the son, who was behind the old man&rsquo;s back, and, raising a sharp axe on high with intent to kill only the mosquito, he cleft his father&rsquo;s head in twain. So the old man fell dead on the spot.</p>
<p class="p7">Thought the Bodhisatta, who had been an eye-witness of the whole scene, &ldquo;Better than such a friend is an enemy with sense, whom fear <a id="a1617"></a><span class="t18">[1.117]</span> of men&rsquo;s vengeance will deter from killing a man.&rdquo; And he recited these lines:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Seyyo amitto matiyā upeto</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Na tveva mitto mativippahīno,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Better is a foe endowed with wisdom than a friend who is lacking in wisdom, thinking: &lsquo;I will kill a mosquito,&rsquo; the foolish son split his father&rsquo;s head open. </span><span class="t18">{1.248}</span></p>
<p class="p23">So saying, the Bodhisatta rose up and departed, passing away in after days to fare according to his deeds. And as for the carpenter, his body was burned by his kinsfolk.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Thus, lay brethren,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;in bygone times also there were those who, seeking to hit a mosquito, struck down a fellow-creature.&rdquo; This lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;In those days I was myself the wise and good trader who departed after repeating the verse.&rdquo;</span></p>

For he is said to have had a maid-servant named Rohiṇī, whose aged mother came to where the girl was pounding rice, and lay down. The flies came round the old woman and stung her as with a needle, so she cried to her daughter, &ldquo;The flies are stinging me, my dear; do drive them away.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll drive them away, mother,&rdquo; said the girl, lifting her pestle to the flies which had settled on her mother. Then, crying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill them!&rdquo; she smote her mother such a blow as to kill the old woman outright. Seeing what she had done the girl began to weep and cry, &ldquo;Oh! Mother, mother!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The news was brought to the Lord High Treasurer, who, after having the body burnt, went his way to the monastery, and told the Teacher what had happened. &ldquo;This is not the first time, layman,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;that in Rohiṇī&rsquo;s anxiety to kill the flies on her mother, she has struck her mother dead with a pestle; she did precisely the same in times past.&rdquo; Then at Anāthapiṇḍika&rsquo;s request, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born the son of the Lord High Treasurer, and came to be Lord High Treasurer himself at his father&rsquo;s death.

And her mother, in like manner, went to where the daughter was pounding rice, and lay down, and called <a id="a1628"></a><span class="t18">[1.118]</span> out, &lsquo;Do drive these flies off me, my dear,&rsquo; and in just the same way she struck her mother with a pestle, and killed her, and began to weep.</p>
<p class="p7">Hearing of what had happened, <span class="t18">{1.249}</span> the Bodhisatta reflected: &lsquo;Here, in this world, even an enemy, with sense, would be preferable,&rsquo; and recited these lines:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Tradition says that, in the course of an alms-journey among the people of Kosala, the Teacher came to a certain hamlet. A householder of the place invited the Tathāgata to take the midday meal at his house, and had his guest seated in the pleasure gardens, where he showed hospitality to the Saṅgha with the Buddha at its head, and courteously gave them leave to stroll at will about his grounds. So the monks rose up and walked about the grounds with the gardener. Observing in their walk a bare space, they said to the gardener, &ldquo;Lay-disciple, elsewhere in the pleasure gardens there is abundant shade; but here there&rsquo;s neither tree nor shrub. How comes this?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;when these grounds were being laid out, a village lad, who was doing the watering, pulled up all the young trees hereabouts and then gave them much or little </span><span class="t18">{1.250}</span><span class="t30"> water according to the size of their roots. So the young trees withered and died off; and that is why this space is bare.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Drawing near to the Teacher, the monks told him this. &ldquo;Yes, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is not the first time that village lad has spoiled a pleasure garden; he did precisely the same in bygone times also.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, a festival was proclaimed in the city; and at the first summoning notes of the festal drum out poured the townsfolk to keep holiday.<a id="a1637"></a><span class="t18"> [1.119]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now in those days, a tribe of monkeys was living in the king&rsquo;s pleasure gardens; and the king&rsquo;s gardener thought to himself, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re holiday-making up in the city. I&rsquo;ll get the monkeys to do the watering for me, and be off to enjoy myself with the rest.&rdquo; So saying, he went to the king of the monkeys, and, first dwelling on the benefits his majesty and his subjects enjoyed from residence in the pleasure gardens in the way of flowers and fruit and young shoots to eat, ended by saying: &ldquo;Today there&rsquo;s holiday-making up in the city, and I&rsquo;m off to enjoy myself. Couldn&rsquo;t you water the young trees while I&rsquo;m away?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Oh! Yes,&rdquo; said the monkey.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Only mind you do,&rdquo; said the gardener; and off he went, giving the monkeys the water-skins and wooden watering-pots to do the work with.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the monkeys took the water-skins and watering pots, and fell to watering the young trees. &ldquo;But we must be careful not to waste the water,&rdquo; observed their king, &ldquo;as you water, first pull each young tree up and look at the size of its roots. Then give plenty of water to those whose roots strike deep, but only a little to those with tiny roots. When this water is all gone, we shall be hard put to it to get more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said the other monkeys, and did as he bade them.</p>
<p class="p7">At this juncture a certain wise man, seeing the monkeys thus engaged, asked them why they pulled up tree after tree and watered them according to the size of their roots. &ldquo;Because such are our king&rsquo;s commands,&rdquo; answered the monkeys.</p>
<p class="p7">Their reply moved the wise man to reflect how, with every desire to do good, the ignorant and foolish only succeed in doing harm. And he recited this verse: <span class="t18">{1.251}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Na ve anatthakusalena atthacariyā sukhāvahā,</span></p>

<p class="p23">With this rebuke to the king of the monkeys, the wise man departed with his followers from the pleasure gardens.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Said the Teacher, &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that this village lad has spoiled pleasure gardens; he was just the same in bygone times also.&rdquo; His lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The village lad who spoiled this pleasure gardens was the king of the monkeys in those days, and I was myself the wise and good man.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">&nbsp;In the present the Buddha hears of an undisciplined monk, and tells a story of how in a past life, despite being warned against it, he had exercised his powers to gain treasure, which fell from the sky, and how this had led to his own destruction, and the destruction of 1,000 more.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;He who by the wrong means.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a wilful monk. Said the Teacher to that monk, &ldquo;This is not the first time, monk, that you have been wilful; you were of just the same disposition in bygone times also; </span><span class="t18">{1.253}</span><span class="t30"> and therefore it was that, as you would not follow the advice of the wise and good, you came to be cut in two by a sharp sword and were flung on the highway; and you were the sole cause why a thousand men met their end.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, there was a brahmin in a village who knew the charm called Vedabbha. Now this charm, so they say, was precious beyond all price. For, if at a certain conjunction of the planets the charm was repeated and the gaze bent upwards to the skies, straightaway from the heavens there rained the Seven Things of Price &ndash; gold, silver, pearl, coral, catseye, ruby, and diamond.</p>
<p class="p7">In those days the Bodhisatta was a pupil of this brahmin; and one day his master left the village on some business or other, and came with the Bodhisatta to the country of Ceti.</p>
<p class="p7">In a forest by the way dwelt five hundred robbers &ndash; known as &ldquo;the Dispatchers&rdquo; who made the way impassable. And these caught the Bodhisatta and the Vedabbha brahmin.</p>
<p class="p7">(Why, you ask, were they called the Dispatchers? Well, the story goes that of every two prisoners they made they used to dispatch one to fetch the ransom; and that&rsquo;s why they were called the Dispatchers. If they captured a father and a son, they told the father to go for the ransom to free his son; if they caught a mother and her daughter, they sent the mother for the money; if they caught two brothers, they let the elder go; and so too, if they caught a teacher and his pupil, it was the pupil they set free. In this case, therefore, they kept the Vedabbha brahmin, and sent the Bodhisatta for <a id="a1661"></a><span class="t18">[1.122]</span> the ransom.)</p>
<p class="p7">And the Bodhisatta said with a bow to his master, &ldquo;In a day or two I shall surely come back; have no fear; only fail not to do as I shall say. Today will come to pass the conjunction of the planets which brings about the rain of the Things of Price. Take heed lest, yielding to this mishap, you repeat the charm and call down the precious shower. For, if you do, calamity will certainly befall both you, and this band of robbers.&rdquo; With this warning to his master, the Bodhisatta went his way in quest of the ransom.</p>
<p class="p7">At sunset the robbers bound the brahmin and laid him by the heels. Just at this moment the full moon rose over the eastern horizon, and the brahmin, studying the heavens, knew <span class="t18">{1.254}</span> that the great conjunction was taking place. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;should I suffer this misery? By repeating the charm I will call down the precious rain, pay the robbers the ransom, and go free.&rdquo; So he called out to the robbers, &ldquo;Friends, why do you take me a prisoner?&rdquo; &ldquo;To get a ransom, venerable sir,&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;Well, if that is all you want,&rdquo; said the brahmin, &ldquo;make haste and untie me; have my head bathed, and new clothes put on me; and let me be perfumed and decked with flowers. Then leave me to myself.&rdquo; The robbers did as he bade them.</p>
<p class="p7">The brahmin, marking the conjunction of the planets, repeated his charm with eyes uplifted to the heavens. Forthwith the Things of Price poured down from the skies! The robbers picked them all up, wrapping their booty into bundles with their cloaks. Then with their brothers they marched away; and the brahmin followed in the rear. But, as luck would have it, the party was captured by a second band of five hundred robbers! &ldquo;Why do you seize us?&rdquo; said the first to the second band. &ldquo;For booty,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;If booty is what you want, seize on that brahmin, who by simply gazing up at the skies brought down riches as rain. It was he who gave us all that we have got.&rdquo; So the second band of robbers let the first band go, and seized on the brahmin, crying, &ldquo;Give us riches too!&rdquo; &ldquo;It would give me great pleasure,&rdquo; said the brahmin, &ldquo;but it will be a year before the requisite conjunction of the planets takes place again. If you will only be so good as to wait till then, I will invoke the precious shower for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Rascally brahmin!&rdquo; cried the angry robbers, &ldquo;you made the other band rich off-hand, but want us to wait a whole year!&rdquo; And they cut him in two with a sharp sword, and flung his body in the middle of the road. Then hurrying after the first band of robbers, they killed every man of them too in hand-to-hand combat, and seized the booty. Next, they divided into two companies and fought among themselves, company against company, till two hundred and fifty men were slain. And so they went on killing one another, till only two were left alive. Thus did those thousand men come to destruction.<a id="a1662"></a><span class="t18"> [1.123]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now, when the two survivors had managed to carry off the treasure they hid it in the jungle near a village; and one of them sat there, sword in hand, <span class="t18">{1.255}</span> to guard it, while the other went into the village to get rice and have it cooked for supper.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1663"></a>&ldquo;Covetousness is the root of ruin!&rdquo; mused he<a id="a1664"></a><a href="notes.html#a14802"><span class="t9">{279}</span></a> that stopped by the treasure. &ldquo;When my mate comes back, he&rsquo;ll want half of this. Suppose I kill him the moment he gets back.&rdquo; So he drew his sword and sat waiting for his comrade&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p class="p7">Meanwhile, the other had equally reflected that the booty had to be halved, and thought to himself, &ldquo;Suppose I poison the rice, and give it to him to eat and so kill him, and have the whole of the treasure to myself.&rdquo; Accordingly, when the rice was boiled, he first ate his own share, and then put poison in the rest, which he carried back with him to the jungle. But scarce had he set it down, when the other robber cut him in two with his sword, and hid the body away in a secluded spot. Then he ate the poisoned rice, and died then and there. Thus, by reason of the treasure, not only the brahmin but all the robbers came to destruction.</p>
<p class="p7">Howbeit, after a day or two the Bodhisatta came back with the ransom. Not finding his master where he had left him, but seeing treasure strewn all round about, his heart misgave him that, in spite of his advice, his master must have called down a shower of treasure from the skies, and that all must have perished in consequence; and he proceeded along the road.</p>
<p class="p7">On his way he came to where his master&rsquo;s body lay cloven in twain upon the way. &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;he is dead through not heeding my warning.&rdquo; Then with gathered sticks he made a pyre and burnt his master&rsquo;s body, making an offering of wild flowers. Further along the road, he came upon the five hundred &ldquo;Dispatchers,&rdquo; and further still upon the two hundred and fifty, and so on by degrees until at last he came to where lay only two corpses. Marking how of the thousand all but two had perished, and feeling sure that there must be two survivors, and that these could not refrain from strife, he pressed on to see where they had gone. So on he went till he found the path by which with the treasure they had turned into the jungle; and there he found the heap of bundles of treasure, and one robber lying dead with his rice-bowl overturned at his side.</p>
<p class="p7">Realising the whole story at a glance, the Bodhisatta set himself to search for the missing man, and at last found his body in the secret spot where it had been flung. <span class="t18">{1.256}</span> &ldquo;And thus,&rdquo; mused the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;through not following my counsel my master in his wilfulness has been the means of destroying not himself only but a thousand others also. Truly, they that <a id="a1665"></a><span class="t18">[1.124]</span> seek their own gain by mistaken and misguided means shall reap ruin, even as my master did.&rdquo; And he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Anupāyena yo atthaṁ icchati so vihaññati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cetā haniṁsu Vedabbaṁ, sabbe te byasanam-ajjhagū ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">He who by the wrong means wishes for benefit suffers hardship, the Cetā thieves killed Vedabba, and they all came to destruction.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a1666"></a><a id="a1667"></a>Thus spake the Bodhisatta, and he went on to say, &ldquo;Even as my master&rsquo;s misguided and misplaced effort in causing the rain of treasure to fall from heaven wrought both his own death and the destruction of others with him, even so shall every other man who by mistaken means seeks to compass his own advantage, utterly perish and involve others in his destruction.&rdquo; With these words did the Bodhisatta make the forest ring; and in this verse did he preach the Dhamma, while the Tree Devatās shouted applause. The treasure he contrived to carry off to his own home, where he lived out his term of life in the exercise of generosity and other good works. And when his life closed, he departed to the heaven he had won.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1668"></a><a id="a1669"></a><span class="t30">Said the Teacher, &ldquo;This is not the first time, monk, you were wilful; you were wilful in bygone times as well; and by your wilfulness you came to utter destruction.&rdquo; His lesson ended, he identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The wilful monk was the Vedabbha brahmin of those days, and I myself his pupil.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a1674"></a><span class="t15">In the present a family agrees to marry their son off and picks a day, then asks their family ascetic if it is auspicious. Peeved that they didn&rsquo;t consult him before setting the day, he tells them it is inauspicious. The other family, disappointed on the day, marry her off to another. The Buddha hearing of it, tells how the same thing had happened to the same people in a past life.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;While waiting on his lucky stars.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{1.257}</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about a certain naked ascetic. Tradition says that a gentleman of the country near Sāvatthi asked in marriage for his son a young Sāvatthi lady of equal rank. Having fixed a day to come and fetch the bride, he subsequently consulted a naked ascetic who was intimate with his family, as to whether the stars were favourable for holding the festivities that day.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t ask me in the first instance,&rdquo; thought the indignant ascetic, &ldquo;but having already fixed the day, without consulting me, just makes an empty </span><a id="a1678"></a><span class="t18">[1.125]</span><span class="t30"> reference to me now. Very good; I&rsquo;ll teach him a lesson.&rdquo; So he made answer that the stars were not favourable for that day; that the nuptials ought not to be celebrated that day; and that, if they were, great misfortune would come of it. And the country family in their faith in their ascetic did not go for the bride that day. Now the bride&rsquo;s friends in the town had made all their preparations for celebrating the nuptials, and when they saw that the other side did not come, they said: &ldquo;It was they who fixed today, and yet they have not come; and we have gone to great expense about it all. Who are these people, forsooth? Let us marry the girl to someone else.&rdquo; So they found another bridegroom and gave the girl to him in marriage with all the festivities they had already prepared.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Next day the country party came to fetch the bride. But the Sāvatthi people rated them as follows, &ldquo;You country folk are a bad lot; you fixed the day yourselves, and then insulted us by not coming. We have given the maiden to another.&rdquo; The country party started a quarrel, but in the end went home the way they came.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now the monks came to know how that naked ascetic had thwarted the festivity, and they began to talk the matter over in the Dhamma Hall. Entering the Hall, and learning on enquiry the subject of their conversation, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time that this same ascetic has thwarted the festivities of that family; out of pique with them, he did just the same thing once before.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, some townsfolk had asked a country-girl in marriage and had named the day. Having already made the arrangement, they asked their family ascetic whether the stars were propitious for the ceremony on that day. Piqued at their having fixed the day to suit themselves without first taking counsel with him, the ascetic made up his mind to thwart their marriage festivities for that day; <span class="t18">{1.258}</span> and accordingly he made answer that the stars were not favourable for that day, and that, if they persisted, grave misfortune would be the result. So, in their faith in the ascetic, they stayed at home! When the country folk found that the town party did not come, they said among themselves, &ldquo;It was they who fixed the marriage for today, and now they have not come. Who are they, forsooth?&rdquo; And they married the girl to someone else.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1679"></a>Next day the townsfolk came and asked for the girl; but they of the country made this answer, &ldquo;You townsfolk lack common decency. You yourselves named the day and yet did not come to fetch the bride. As you stayed away, we married her to someone else.&rdquo; &ldquo;But we asked our ascetic, and he told us the stars were unfavourable. That&rsquo;s why we did not come, yesterday. Give us the girl.&rdquo; &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come at the proper time, and now she&rsquo;s another&rsquo;s. How can we marry her twice over?&rdquo; While they wrangled thus with one another, a wise man from the town came into the country on business. Hearing the townsfolk explain that they had consulted their ascetic and that their absence was due to the unfavourable disposition of the stars, he exclaimed, &ldquo;What, forsooth, do <a id="a1680"></a><span class="t18">[1.126]</span> the stars matter? Is not the lucky thing to get the girl?&rdquo; And, so saying, he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Nakkhattaṁ patimānentaṁ attho bālaṁ upaccagā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Attho atthassa nakkhattaṁ, kiṁ karissanti tārakā ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">While waiting on his lucky stars, benefit passes the fool by, benefit is benefit&rsquo;s lucky star, what can the stars achieve?</span></p>
<p class="p23">As for the townsfolk, as they did not get the girl for all their wrangling, they had to go off home again!</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Said the Teacher, &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that this naked ascetic has thwarted that family&rsquo;s festivities; he did just the same thing in bygone times also.&rdquo; His lesson ended, he showed the connection and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;This ascetic </span><span class="t18">{1.259}</span><span class="t30"> was also the ascetic of those days, and the families too were the same; I myself was the wise and good man who uttered the verse.&rdquo;</span></p>
