<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present when the Buddha returns to his kinsmen they do not want to pay respects to him as he is younger than they are. He then tells a story of a prince who was so generous he was sent into exile by the people, even there he gave away all he had, including his children and his wife. Recognising his virtue the people call him back to be their king. Sakka provides the king with a ready supply of gifts to be given away.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Ten boons.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.479}</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Grove, about a shower of rain.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher turned the precious Wheel of the Dhamma and came in due course to Rājagaha, where he spent the winter, with elder Udāyi leading the way, and attended by twenty thousand saints, he entered Kapilavatthu: whereupon the Sakya princes gathered together to see the chief of their clan. They inspected the Fortunate One&rsquo;s abode, saying: &ldquo;A delightful place this Banyan Grove, worthy of Sakka.&rdquo; Then they made all due provision for guarding it; and making ready to meet him with fragrant posies in their hands, they sent first all the youngest boys and girls of the township dressed in their best, next the princes and princesses, and amongst these themselves did honour to the Teacher with fragrant flowers and powders, escorting the Fortunate One as far as the Banyan Park; where the Fortunate One took his seat, surrounded by twenty thousand saints upon the Buddha&rsquo;s goodly seat, which was appointed for him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13962"></a><span class="t30">Now the Sākiyas are a proud and stiff-necked race; and they, thinking within themselves: &ldquo;Prince Siddhattha is younger than we; he is our younger brother, our nephew, our grandson,&rdquo; said to the younger princes, &ldquo;You do him obeisance; we will sit behind you.&rdquo; As they sat there without doing obeisance to him, the Fortunate One, perceiving their intent, thought to himself, &ldquo;My kinsfolk do me no obeisance; well, I will make them do so.&rdquo; So he caused to arise in him that Absorption which is based on the Super Knowledges, rose up into the air, and as though shaking off the dust of his feet upon their heads, performed a miracle like the twofold miracle at the foot of the knot-mango tree.</span><a id="a13963"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17753"><span class="t9">{1680}</span></a><a id="a13964"></a><span class="t30"> The king, seeing this wonder, said: &ldquo;Sir, on the day of your birth, when I saw your feet placed upon the head of brahmin Kāladevala who had come to do you obeisance, I did obeisance to you, and that was the first time. On the day of the Plowing Festival, when you sat on the royal seat under the shade of a Jambu plum tree, </span><span class="t18">[6.247] </span><span class="t30">when I saw that the shadow of the tree moved not, I did obeisance to your feet; and that was the second time. And now again, I see a miracle which I never saw before, and do obeisance to your feet, this is the third time.&rdquo; But when the king had thus done obeisance, not one Sākiya could sit still and refrain, they did obeisance one and all.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Fortunate One, having thus made his kinsfolk do obeisance to him, came down from the air and sat upon the appointed seat; when the Fortunate One was there seated, his kinsfolk were made wise, and sat with peace in their hearts. Then a great cloud arose, and burst into a shower of rain: down came the rain red and with a loud noise, and those who desired to be wet were wetted, </span><span class="t18">{6.480}</span><span class="t30"> but he who did not, had not even a drop fell upon his body. All who saw it were astonished at the miracle, and cried one to another, &ldquo;Lo, a marvel! Lo, a miracle! Lo, the power of the Buddhas, on whose kinsfolk such a shower of rain is falling!&rdquo; On hearing this, the Buddha said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that a great shower of rain has fallen upon my kinsfolk,&rdquo; and then, at their request, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx35192"></a><a id="a13965"></a>The Ten Boons</h4>
<p class="p7">In the past, a king named Sivi, reigning in the city of Jetuttara in the kingdom of Sivi, had a son named Sañjaya. When the lad came of age, the king brought him a princess named Phusatī, daughter of king Madda, and handed over the kingdom to him, making Phusatī his queen consort. Her former connection with the world was as follows.</p>
<p class="p7">In the ninety-first age from this, a Teacher arose in the world named Vipassī. While he was dwelling in the deer-park of Khema, near the city of Bandhumatī, a certain king sent to king Bandhuma a golden wreath worth a hundred thousand pieces of money, with precious sandalwood. Now the king had two daughters; and being desirous to give this present to them, he gave the sandalwood to the elder and the golden wreath to the younger. But both declined to use these gifts for themselves; and with the intent to offer them in respect to the Teacher, they said to the king, &ldquo;Father, we will offer to the One with Ten Powers this sandalwood and this golden wreath.&rdquo; To this the king gave his consent. So the elder princess powdered the sandalwood, and filled with the powder a golden box; and the younger sister caused the golden wreath to be made into a golden necklet, and laid it in a golden box. Then they both proceeded to the hermitage in the deer-park; and the elder sister, reverently sprinkling the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; golden body with the sandalwood powder, scattered the rest in his cell, and said this prayer, &ldquo;Sir, in time to come, may I be the mother of a Buddha like you.&rdquo; The younger reverently placed upon the Tathāgata&rsquo;s golden body the gold-lace necklet which had been made out of the golden wreath, and prayed, &ldquo;Sir, until I become an Arahat, may this ornament never part from my body.&rdquo; And the Teacher granted their prayers.<span class="t18"> {6.481}</span></p>
<p class="p7">Both these, after their life was over, came into being in the world of gods. The elder sister, passing from the world of gods to the <span class="t18">[6.248] </span><a id="a13966"></a><a id="a13967"></a><a id="a13968"></a>world of men and back again, at the end of the ninety-first age became queen Māyā mother of the Buddha. The younger sister passing to and fro in like manner, in the time of Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, became the daughter of king Kiki; and being born with the semblance of a necklace upon her neck and shoulders, beautiful as though drawn by a painter, she was named Uracchadā [Necklace]. When she was a girl of sixteen years, she heard a pious utterance of the Teacher, and attained to the fruit of the First Path, and so the very same day she became an Arahat, and then entered the Saṅgha, and attained Nibbāna.</p>
<p class="p7">Now king Kiki had seven other daughters, whose names were:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Samaṇī, Samaṇā, the holy sister Guttā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bhikkhudāsikā, and Dhammā and Sudhammā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And of the sisters the seventh Saṅghadāsī.</span></p>
<p class="p6">In this manifestation of the Buddha, these sisters were:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Khemā, Uppalavaṇṇā, the third was Paṭācārā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gotamā, Dhammadinnā, and sixthly Mahāmāyā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And of this band of sisters the seventh was Visākhā.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13969"></a>Now of these Phusatī became Sudhammā; who did good deeds and gave alms, and by fruit of the offering of sandalwood done to Buddha Vipassī, had her body as it were sprinkled with choice sandalwood. Then passing to and fro between the worlds of men and of gods, eventually she became chief queen of Sakka, King of the Devas. After her days there were done,<a id="a13970"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17755"><span class="t9">{1681}</span></a> and the five customary signs were to be seen, Sakka, King of the Devas, realizing that her time was exhausted, escorted her with great glory to the pleasure gardens in Nandana grove; then as she reclined on a richly adorned seat, he, sitting beside it, said to her, &ldquo;Dear Phusatī, ten boons I grant you: choose.&rdquo; With these words, he uttered the first verse in this Great Vessantarajātaka [Ja 547] with its thousand<a id="a13971"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17757"><span class="t9">{1682}</span></a> verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Ten boons I give you, Phusatī, O beauteous lady bright:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Choose you whatever on the earth is precious in your sight.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{6.482}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus she came to be established in the world of gods by the preaching in the Great Vessantara.</p>
<p class="p7">But she, not knowing the circumstances of her rebirth, felt faint, and said the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Glory to you, O king of gods! What wrong is done by me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To send me from this lovely place as winds blow down a tree?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And Sakka perceiving her despondency uttered two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Dear are you still as you have been, and wrong you have not done:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I speak because your merit now is all used up and gone.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Now your departure is at hand, the hour of death draws nigh:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ten boons I offer you to choose; then choose, before you die.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [6.249]</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13972"></a>Hearing these words of Sakka, and convinced that she must die, she said, choosing the boons:<a id="a13973"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17759"><span class="t9">{1683}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;King Sakka, lord of beings all, a boon hath granted me:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I bless him: craving that my life in Sivi&rsquo;s realm may be.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Black eyes, black pupils like a fawn, black eyebrows may I have,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13974"></a><span class="t12">And Phusatī my name: this boon, O bounteous one, I crave.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. A son be mine, revered by kings, famed, glorious, debonair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bounteous, ungrudging, one to lend a ready ear to prayer.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. And while the babe is in my womb let not my figure go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let it be slim and graceful like a finely fashioned bow.</span><span class="t18"> {6.483}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13975"></a><span class="t12">9. Still, Sakka, may my breasts be firm, nor white-haired may I be;</span><a id="a13976"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17761"><span class="t19">{1684}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13977"></a><span class="t12">My body all unblemished, may I set the death-doomed free.</span><a id="a13978"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17763"><span class="t19">{1685}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Mid herons&rsquo; cries, and peacocks&rsquo; calls, with waiting women fair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13979"></a><span class="t12">Poets and bards to sing our praise, shawls waving in the air,</span><a id="a13980"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17765"><span class="t19">{1686}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. When rattling on the painted door the menial calls aloud,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">God bless king Sivi! Come to meat! Be I his queen avowed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;Know that these boons, my lady bright, which I have granted you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In Sivi kingdom, beauteous one, all ten fulfilled shall be. </span><span class="t18">{6.484}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. So spake the monarch of the gods, the great Sujampati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Called Vāsava, well pleased to grant a boon to Phusatī.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx35244"></a>The Himālayas</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13981"></a>When she had thus chosen her boons, she left that world, and was conceived in the womb of king Madda&rsquo;s queen;<a id="a13982"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17767"><span class="t9">{1687}</span></a><a id="a13983"></a> and when she was born, because her body was as it were sprinkled with the perfume of sandalwood, on her name-day they called her by the name Phusatī [Sprinkled]. She grew up amidst a great company of attendants until in her sixteenth year she surpassed all others in beauty.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time prince Sañjaya, son of the king of Sivi, was to be invested with the white umbrella; the princess was sent for to be his bride, and she was made queen consort at the head of sixteen thousand women; wherefore it is said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;Next born a princess, Phusatī was to the city led,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Jetuttara, and there anon to Sañjaya was wed.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[6.250]</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13984"></a>Sañjaya loved her dearly. Now Sakka pondering remembered how that nine of his ten boons given to Phusatī were fulfilled. &ldquo;But one is left unfulfilled,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;a goodly son; this I will fulfil for her.&rdquo; At that time the Great Being was in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, and his time was done; perceiving which Sakka approached him, and said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, you must enter the world of men; without delay you must be conceived in the womb of Phusatī, queen consort of the king of Sivi.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">With these words, asking the consent of the Great Being and the sixty thousand Devaputtas who were destined to rebirth, he went to his own place. The Great Being came down and was reborn there, and the sixty thousand Devaputtas were born in the families of sixty thousand courtiers. Phusatī, when the Great Being was conceived in her womb, finding herself with child, desired six alms halls to be built, one at each of the four gates, one in the middle of the city, and one at her own door; that each day she might distribute six hundred thousand pieces. The king, learning how it was with her, consulted the fortune-tellers, who said: &ldquo;Great king, in your wife&rsquo;s womb is conceived a being devoted to generosity, who will never be satisfied with giving.&rdquo; Hearing this he was pleased, and made a practice of giving as before said.<a id="a13985"></a><span class="t18"> {6.485}</span></p>
<p class="p7">From the time of the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s conception, there was no end one might say to the king&rsquo;s revenue; by the influence of the king&rsquo;s goodness, the kings of all Jambudīpa sent him presents.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13986"></a>Now the queen while with child remained with her large company of attendants, until ten months were fulfilled, and then she wished to visit the city. She informed the king, who caused the city to be decorated like to a city of the gods: he set his queen in a noble chariot, and made procession about the city rightwise. When they had reached the midst of the Vessa<a id="a13987"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17769"><span class="t9">{1688}</span></a><a id="a13988"></a> quarter, the pains of travail<a id="a13989"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17771"><span class="t9">{1689}</span></a> seized upon her. They told the king, and then and there he caused a lying-in chamber to be made and made her go there; and then she brought forth a son; wherefore it is said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;Ten months she bore me in her womb; procession then they made;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Phusatī in Vessa Street through me was brought to bed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13990"></a>The Great Being came from his mother&rsquo;s womb free from impurity, open-eyed, and on the instant holding out his hand to his mother, he said: &ldquo;Mother, I wish to make some gift; is there anything?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;Yes, my son, give as you will,&rdquo; and dropped a purse of a thousand pieces into the outstretched hand. Three times the Great Being spoke as soon as born: in the Ummaggajātaka [Ja 546], in this Jātaka [Ja 547], and in his last birth. On <span class="t18">[6.251] </span>his name-day, because he was born in the Vessa Street, they gave him the name Vessantara; wherefore it is said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;My name not from the mother&rsquo;s side nor from the father&rsquo;s came;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13991"></a><span class="t12">As I was born in Vessa Street, Vessantara&rsquo;s my name.&rdquo;</span><a id="a13992"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17773"><span class="t19">{1690}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13993"></a>On his very birthday, a female flying elephant brought a young one, esteemed to be of lucky omen, white all over, and left it in the royal stables. Because this creature came to supply a need of the Great Being, they named it Paccaya [Support]. The king appointed four times sixty<a id="a13994"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17775"><span class="t9">{1691}</span></a> nurses for the Great Being, neither too tall nor too short, and free from all other fault, with sweet milk; he appointed also nurses for the sixty thousand children born with him, and so he grew up surrounded by this great company of sixty thousand children. The king caused to be made a prince&rsquo;s necklace with a hundred thousand pieces of money, and gave it to his son; but he, being of four or five years of age, <span class="t18">{6.486}</span> gave it away to his nurses, nor would he take it back when they wished to give it. They told this to the king, who said: &ldquo;What my son has given is well given; be it a brahmin&rsquo;s gift,&rdquo; and had another necklace made. But the prince still in his childhood gave this also to his nurses, and so nine times over.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13995"></a>When he was eight years old, as he reclined on his couch, the boy thought to himself, &ldquo;All that I give comes from without, and this does not satisfy me; I wish to give something of my very own. If one should ask my heart, I would cut open my breast, and tear it out, and give it; if one ask my eyes, I would pluck out my eyes and give them; if one should ask my flesh, I would cut off all the flesh of my body and give it.&rdquo; And thus he pondered with all his being and the depths of his heart; this earth, forty thousand quadrillions of leagues<a id="a13996"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17777"><span class="t9">{1692}</span></a> in extent, and two hundred thousands of leagues in depth, quaked thundering like a great mad elephant; Sineru chief of mountains bowed like a sapling in hot steam, and seemed to dance, and stood leaning towards the city of Jetuttara; at the earth&rsquo;s rumbling the sky thundered with lightning and rain; forked lightning flashed; the ocean was stirred up: Sakka, King of the Devas, clapped his arms, Mahābrahmā gave a sign of approval, high as Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm all was in uproar; wherefore it is said also:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;When I was yet a little boy, but of the age of eight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Upon my terrace, generosity and gifts I meditate.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. If any man should ask of me blood, body, heart, or eye,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or blood or body, eye or heart I&rsquo;d give him, was my cry.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. And as with all my being I pondered with thoughts like these</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The unshaken earth did shake and quake with mountains, woods and trees.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[6.252]</span></p>
<p class="p6">By the age of sixteen, the Bodhisatta had attained a mastery of all sciences. Then his father, desiring to make him king, consulted with his mother; from the family of king Madda they brought his first cousin, named Maddī, with sixteen thousand attendant women, and made her his queen consort, and sprinkled him with the water of coronation. From the time of his receiving the kingdom he distributed much alms, giving each day six hundred thousand pieces of money.</p>
<p class="p7">By and by queen Maddī <span class="t18">{6.487}</span><a id="a13997"></a> brought forth a son, and they laid him in a golden hammock, for which reason they gave him the name of prince Jāli [Net]. By the time he could go on foot the queen bore a daughter, and they laid her in a black skin, for which reason they gave her the name of Kaṇhājinā [Black Skin]. Each month the Great Being would visit his six alms halls six times, mounted upon his magnificent elephant.</p>
<p class="p7">Now at that time there was drought in the kingdom of Kāliṅga: the corn grew not, there was a great famine, and men being unable to live resorted to robbery. Tormented by want, the people gathered in the king&rsquo;s courtyard and upbraided him. Hearing this the king said: &ldquo;What is it, my children?&rdquo; They told him. He replied, &ldquo;Good, my children, I will bring the rain,&rdquo; and dismissed them. He pledged himself to virtue, and kept the Uposatha vow, but he could not make the rain come; so he summoned the citizens together, and said to them, &ldquo;I pledged myself to virtue, and seven days I kept the Uposatha vow, yet I could not make the rain come: what is to be done now?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;If you cannot bring the rain, my lord, Vessantara in the city of Jetuttara, king Sañjaya&rsquo;s son, is devoted to generosity; he has a glorious elephant all white, and wherever he goes the rain falls; send brahmins, and ask for that elephant, and bring him here.&rdquo; The king agreed; and assembling the brahmins he chose out eight of them, gave them provisions for their journey, and said to them, &ldquo;Go and fetch Vessantara&rsquo;s elephant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">On this mission, the brahmins proceeded in due course to Jetuttara city; in the alms-hall they received entertainment; sprinkled their bodies with dust and smeared them with mud; and on the day of the full moon, to ask for the king&rsquo;s elephant, they went to the eastern gate at the time the king came to the alms-hall. Early in the morning, the king, intending a visit to the alms-hall, washed himself with sixteen pitchers of perfumed water, and broke his fast, and mounted upon the back of his noble elephant richly adorned proceeded to the eastern gate. The brahmins found no opportunity there, and went to the southern gate, standing upon a mound and watched the king giving alms at the eastern gate. When he came to the southern gate, stretching out their hands they cried, &ldquo;Victory to the noble Vessantara!&rdquo; The Great Being, as he saw the brahmins, drove the elephant to the place whereon they stood, and seated upon its back uttered the first verse: <span class="t18">[6.253] {6.488}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. &ldquo;With hairy armpits, hairy heads, stained teeth, and dust on poll,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O brahmins, stretching forth your hands, what is it that you crave?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this the brahmins replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. &ldquo;We crave a precious thing, O prince that do your people save:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13998"></a><span class="t12">That choice and saving</span><a id="a13999"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17779"><span class="t19">{1693}</span></a><span class="t12"> elephant with tusks like any pole.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the Great Being heard this, he thought: &ldquo;I am willing to give anything that is my own, from my head onwards, and what they ask is something outside me; I will fulfil their wish,&rdquo; and from the elephant&rsquo;s back, he replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;I give, and never shrink from it, that which the brahmins want,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This noble beast, for riding fit, fierce tuskèd elephant,&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">and thus consenting:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. &ldquo;The king, the saviour of his folk, dismounted from its back,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And glad in sacrificing, gave the brahmins what they lacked.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a14000"></a>The ornaments on the elephant&rsquo;s four feet were worth four hundred thousand, those on his two sides were worth two hundred thousand, the blanket under his belly a hundred thousand, on his back were nets of pearls, of gold, and of jewels, three nets worth three hundred thousand, in the two ears two hundred thousand, on his back a rug worth a hundred thousand, the ornament on the frontal globes worth a hundred thousand, three wrappings<a id="a14001"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17781"><span class="t9">{1694}</span></a> three hundred thousand, the small ear-ornaments two hundred thousand, those on the two tusks two hundred thousand, the ornament for luck on his trunk a hundred thousand, that on his tail a hundred thousand, not to mention the priceless ornaments on his body two and twenty hundred thousand, a ladder to mount, by one hundred thousand, the food-vessel a hundred thousand, <span class="t18">{6.489}</span> which comes to as much as four and twenty hundred thousand: moreover the jewels great and small upon the canopy, the jewels in his necklace of pearls, the jewels in the goad, the jewels in the pearl necklace about his neck, the jewels on his frontal globes, all these without price, the elephant also without price, making with the elephant seven priceless things &ndash; all these he gave to the brahmins; besides five hundred attendants with the grooms and stablemen: and with that gift the earthquake came to pass, and the other portents as related above.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher spoke:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. &ldquo;Then was a mighty terror felt, then bristling of the hair;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When the great elephant was given the earth did quake for fear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. Then was a mighty terror felt, then bristling of the hair;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When the great elephant was given, trembled the town for fear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. With a resounding mighty roar the city all did ring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When the great elephant was given by Sivi&rsquo;s foster-king.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[6.254]</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a14002"></a>The city of Jetuttara all did tremble. The brahmins, we are told, at the southern gate received the elephant, mounted upon his back, and amidst a thronging multitude passed through the midst of the city. The crowd, beholding them, cried out, &ldquo;O brahmins, mounted upon our elephant, why are you taking our elephant?&rdquo; The brahmins replied, &ldquo;The great king Vessantara has given the elephant to us: who are you?&rdquo; and so with contemptuous gestures to the crowd, through the city they passed and out by the northern gate by aid of the deities.<a id="a14003"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17783"><span class="t9">{1695}</span></a> The people of the city, angry with the Bodhisatta, uttered loud reproaches.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. &ldquo;Upon that loud and mighty sound, so terrible to hear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When the great elephant was given the earth did quake for fear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">28. Upon that loud and mighty sound, so terrible to hear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When the great elephant was given trembled the town to hear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">29. So loud and mighty was the sound all terrible did ring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When the great elephant was given by Sivi&rsquo;s foster-king.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.490}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The citizens, trembling at heart for this gift, addressed themselves to the king. Therefore it is said:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14004"></a><span class="t12">30. &ldquo;Then prince and brahmin, Vesiya and Ugga,</span><a id="a14005"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17785"><span class="t19">{1696}</span></a><span class="t12"> great and small,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mahouts and footmen, charioteers and soldiers, one and all,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">31. The country landowners, and all the Sivi folk come by.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seeing the elephant depart, thus to the king did cry:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">32. &lsquo;Your realm is ruined, sire: why should Vessantara your son</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus give away our elephant revered by every one?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14006"></a><span class="t12">33. Why give our saviour elephant, pole-tuskèd, goodly, white,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which ever knew the vantage-ground to choose in every fight?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">34. With jewels and his yak-tail fan; which trampled down all foes;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Long-tuskèd, furious, white as Mount Kelāsa with his snows;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">35. With trappings and white parasol, fit riding for a king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With leech and driver, he has given away this precious thing.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After saying this, they said again:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. &ldquo;Whoso bestows with food and drink, with raiment, fire and fleet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That is a right and proper gift, for brahmins that is meet.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. O Sañjaya, your people&rsquo;s friend, say why this thing was done</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By him, a prince of our own line, Vessantara, your son?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. The bidding of the Sivi folk if you refuse to do,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The people then will act, I think, against your son and you.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.491}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, the king suspected that they wished to slay Vessantara; and he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">39. &ldquo;Yea, let my country be no more, my kingdom no more be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Banish I will not from his realm a prince from fault quite free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor will obey the people&rsquo;s voice: my true-born son is he. </span><span class="t18">[6.255]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">40. Yea, let my country be no more, my kingdom no more be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Banish I will not from his realm a prince from fault quite free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor will obey the people&rsquo;s voice: my very son is he.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">41. No, I will work no harm on him; all noble is he still;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And it would be a shame for me, and it would cause much ill.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vessantara, my very son, with sword how could I kill?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The people of Sivi replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">42. &ldquo;Not chastisement does he deserve, nor sword, nor prison cell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But from the kingdom banish him, on Vaṅka&rsquo;s mount to dwell.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">43. &ldquo;Behold the people&rsquo;s will! And I that will do not gainsay.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But let him bide one happy night before he go away.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">44. After the space of this one night, when dawns the coming day,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Together let the people come and banish him away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">They agreed to the king&rsquo;s proposal for just the one night. Then he let them go away, and thinking to send a message to his son, he commissioned an agent, who accordingly went to Vessantara&rsquo;s house and told him what had befallen.<span class="t18"> {6.492}</span></p>
<p class="p7">To make this clear, the following verses were said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">45. &ldquo;Rise, fellow, go away post-haste, and tell the prince my word.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The people all, and citizens, in wrath, with one accord,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">46. Uggas and princes, vesiyas and brahmins too, my son,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mahouts and lifeguards, charioteers, and footmen, every one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All citizens, all country folk, together here have run,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">47. After the space of this one night, when dawns the coming day,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They will assemble one and all and banish you away.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">48. This fellow sent by Sivi&rsquo;s king swift on his errand pressed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Upon an armed elephant, perfumed, and finely dressed,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">49. Head bathed in water, jewelled rings in ears, and on he rode</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Till to that lovely town he came, Vessantara&rsquo;s abode.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">50. Then he beheld the happy prince abiding in his land,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like Vāsava the king of gods; round him the courtiers stand.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">51. There in haste the fellow went, and to the prince said he:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;I bear ill tidings, royal sir: be not angry with me!&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">52. With due obeisance, weeping sore, he said unto the king:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;You are my master, sire, and you do give me every thing:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bad news I have to tell you now: do you some comfort bring.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">53. The people all and citizens, in wrath, with one consent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Uggas and princes, vesiyas and brahmins, all are bent,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">54. Mahouts and lifeguards, charioteers, the footmen every one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All citizens and country folk together now have run,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">55. After the space of this one night, when dawns the coming day,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Determined all to come in crowds and banish you away.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">56. &ldquo;Why are people angry with me? For no offence I see.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell me, good fellow, wherefore pray they wish to banish me?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[6.256] {6.493}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The agent said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">57. &ldquo;Uggas and vesiyas, charioteers, and brahmins every one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mahouts and lifeguards, charioteers and footmen, there run,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All angry at your giving gifts, and therefore banish you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, the Great Being, in all content, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">58. &ldquo;My very eye and heart I&rsquo;d give: why not what is not mine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or gold or treasure, precious stones, or pearls, or jewels fine?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14007"></a><span class="t12">59. Comes any one to ask of me, I&rsquo;d give my hand, my right,</span><a id="a14008"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17787"><span class="t19">{1697}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor for a moment hesitate: in gifts is my delight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">60. Now let the people banish me, now let the people kill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or cut me sevenfold, for cease from gifts I never will.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, the agent again spoke, no message of the king&rsquo;s or of the people&rsquo;s, but another command out of his own mind:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">61. &ldquo;This is the Sivi people&rsquo;s will; they bade me tell you so:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where Kontimārā by the hill Ārañjara does flow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There depart, where banished men, good sir, are wont to go.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">This he said, we are told, by inspiration of a deity.</p>
<p class="p7">Hearing this, the Bodhisatta replied, &ldquo;Very well, I shall go by the road that those go who have offended; but me the citizens do not banish for any offence, they banish me for the gift of the elephant. In this case I wish to give the great gift of the seven hundreds, and I pray the citizens to grant me one day&rsquo;s delay for that. Tomorrow I will make my gift, the next day I will go.&rdquo;<span class="t18"> {6.494}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">62. &ldquo;So I by that same road shall go as they who do offend:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But first to make a gift, one night and day I pray them lend.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the agent, &ldquo;I will report this to the citizens,&rdquo; and away he went.</p>
<p class="p7">The man gone, the Great Being summoning one of his captains said to him, &ldquo;Tomorrow I am to make the gift called the gift of the seven hundreds. You must get ready seven hundred elephants, with the same number of horses, chariots, girls, cows, men slaves and women slaves, and provide every kind of food and drink, even the strong liquor, everything which is fit to give.&rdquo; So having arranged for the great gift of the seven hundreds, he dismissed his courtiers, and alone departed to the dwelling of Maddī; where seating himself on the royal couch, he began to address her.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher thus described it:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">63. &ldquo;Thus did the king to Maddī speak, that lady passing fair:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;All that I ever gave to you, or goods or grain, beware,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">64. Or gold or treasure, precious stones, and plenty more beside,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your father&rsquo;s dower, find a place this treasure all to hide.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">65. Then out spake Maddī to the king, that princess passing fair:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where shall I find a place, my lord, to hide it? Tell me where?&rsquo; &rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [6.257]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Vessantara said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">66. &ldquo;In due proportion on the good your wealth in gifts bestow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No other place than this is safe to keep it, well I know.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{6.495}</span></p>
<p class="p6">She consented, and withal he exhorted her in this wise:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">67. &ldquo;Be kind, O Maddī, to your sons, your husband&rsquo;s parents both,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To him who will your husband be do service, nothing loth.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">68. And if no man should wish to be your husband, when I&rsquo;m gone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Go seek a husband for thyself, but do not pine alone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Maddī thought: &ldquo;Why I wonder does Vessantara say such a thing to me?&rdquo; And she asked him, &ldquo;My lord, why do you say to me what you ought not to say?&rdquo; The Great Being replied, &ldquo;Lady, the people of Sivi, angry with me for the gift of the elephant, are banishing me from the realm: tomorrow I am to make the gift of the seven hundreds, and next day I depart from the city.&rdquo; And he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">69. &ldquo;Tomorrow to a forest drear, beset with beasts of prey,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I go: and whether I can live within it, who can say?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">70. Then spake the princess Maddī, spake the lady passing fair:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ldquo;It is not so! A wicked word! To say it do not dare!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">71. It is not meet and right, my king, that you alone should fare:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whatever journey you shall go, I also will be there.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">72. Give me the choice to die with you, or live from you apart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Death is my choice, unless I can live with you where you art.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">73. Kindle a blazing fiery flame the fiercest that can be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There I would rather die the death than live apart from thee.</span><a id="a14009"></a><span class="t18"> {6.496}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">74. As close behind an elephant his mate is often found</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Moving through mountain pass or wood, o&rsquo;er rough or level ground,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">75. So with my boys I&rsquo;ll follow you, wherever you may lead,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14010"></a><span class="t12">Nor shall you find me burdensome or difficult to feed.&rdquo;</span><a id="a14011"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17789"><span class="t19">{1698}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">With these words she began to praise the region of the Himālayas as if she had seen it:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">76. &ldquo;When you shall see your pretty boys, and hear their prattle ring</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Under the greenwood, you&rsquo;ll forget that ever you were king.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">78. When you shall see your pretty boys, and hear their prattle ring</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In our fair home, you will forget that ever you were king.</span></p>

<p class="p6">Thus did Maddī sing the praises of the Himālayas in these verses, as though she were dwelling therein.</p>

<p class="p7">Now queen Phusatī thought: &ldquo;A harsh command has been laid upon my son, what will he do? I will go and find out.&rdquo; In a covered carriage she went, and taking up her position at the door of their chamber, she overheard their converse and uttered a bitter lamentation.</p>
<p class="p7">Describing this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">99. &ldquo;She heard the princess and her son, the talk that passed between,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">100. Better drink poison, better leap from off a cliff, say I,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or better bind a strangling noose about my neck and die:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">101. So studious and free from greed, giving to all who came,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Respected by his rival kings, of great and glorious fame,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why banish they Vessantara, my unoffending son?&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.499}</span></p>
<p class="p6">After this bitter lament, she consoled her son and his wife, and went before the king and said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">104. &ldquo;Like mangoes fallen to the ground, like money waste and spent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So falls your kingdom, if they will banish the innocent.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">106. I tell you true, O mighty king: let not your good go by,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor banish him, the innocent, because the people cry.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing which, the king answered:</p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">114. He once by sandal-scent perfumed, awaked by dance and song,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">156. Seven hundred kine he also gave, with silver milkpails all:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">157. Seven hundred female slaves he gave, as many men at call:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">158-159. Cars, horses, women, elephants he gave, yet after all,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lo, now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">160. That was a thing most terrible, that made the hair to stand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14026"></a><span class="t12">When now the king Vessantara goes banished from the land!&rdquo;</span><a id="a14027"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17802"><span class="t19">{1704}</span></a><span class="t18"> {6.505}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now a deity told the news to the kings of all Jambudīpa: how Vessantara was giving great gifts of high-born maidens and the like. Therefore the Khattiyas by the divine power came in a chariot, and returned with the high-born maidens and so forth that they had received. Thus did khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, and suddas, all receive gifts at his hands before they departed. He was still distributing his gifts when evening fell; so he returned to his dwelling, to greet his parents and that <span class="t18">[6.262] </span>night to depart. In gorgeous chariot he proceeded to the place where his parents dwelt, and with him Maddī went, in order to take leave of his parents with him. The Great Being greeted his father and announced their coming.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">161. &ldquo;Give greeting to king Sañjaya the righteous: bid him know</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That since he now does banish me, to Vaṅka hill I go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">162. Whatever beings, mighty king, the future time shall know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With their desires unsatisfied to Yama&rsquo;s house shall go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14028"></a><span class="t12">163. For wrong</span><a id="a14029"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17804"><span class="t19">{1705}</span></a><span class="t12"> I did my people, giving bounty from my hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By all the people&rsquo;s sentence I go banished from the land.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">164. That wrong now I expiate in the panther-haunted wood:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14030"></a><span class="t12">If you will wallow in the slough,</span><a id="a14031"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17806"><span class="t19">{1706}</span></a><span class="t12"> yet I will still do good.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">These four verses the Great Being addressed to his father; and then he turned to his mother, asking her permission to leave the world with these words:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">165. &ldquo;Mother, I take my leave of you, a banished man I stand.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For wrong I did my people, giving bounty from my hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By all the people&rsquo;s sentence I go banished from the land. </span><span class="t18">{6.506}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">166. That wrong now I expiate in the panther-haunted wood:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you will wallow in the slough, yet I will still do good.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">In reply, Phusatī said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">167. &ldquo;I give you leave to go, my son, and take my blessing too:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Leave Maddī and the boys behind, for she will never do;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fair rounded limbs and slender waist, why need she go with you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Vessantara said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">168. &ldquo;Even a slave against her will I would not take away:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But if she wishes, let her come; if not, then let her stay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing what his son said, the king proceeded to entreat her.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">169. &ldquo;And then unto his daughter-in-law the king began to say:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Let not your sandal-scented limbs bear dust and dirt, I pray,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">170. Wear not bark-fibre wraps instead of fine Benares stuff;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Blessed princess, go not! Forest life indeed is hard enough.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">171. Then princess Maddī, bright and fair, her father-in-law addressed:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;To be without Vessantara I care not to be blessed.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">172. Then Sivi&rsquo;s mighty fostering king thus spake to her again:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Come, Maddī, listen while the woes of forests I explain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">173. The swarms of insects and of gnats, of beetles and of bees</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Would sting you in that forest life, unto your great dis-ease.</span><span class="t18"> {6.507}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">174. For dwellers on the river banks hear other plagues that wait:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The boa-constrictor (poisonless &rsquo;tis true, but strong and great),</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">175. If any man or any beast come near, will take firm hold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And drag them to his lurking-place enwrapped in many a fold.</span><span class="t18"> [6.263]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">176. Then there are other dangerous beasts with black and matted hair;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They can climb trees to catch a man: this beast is called a bear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">177. Along the stream Sotumbarā there dwells the buffalo;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which with his great sharp-pointed horns can give a mighty blow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">178. Seeing these herds of mighty kine wander the forest through,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like some poor cow that seeks her calf say what will Maddī do?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">179. When crowds of monkeys in the trees gather, they will affright</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You, Maddī, in your ignorance with their uncomely sight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">180. In the past the jackal&rsquo;s howl would bring great fear to you:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now dwelling on the Vaṅka hill, Maddī, what will you do?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">181. Why would you go to such a place? Even at high midday,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When all the birds are stilled to rest, the forest roars away.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">182. Then beauteous Maddī to the king spake up and answered so:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;As for these things so terrible, which you have tried to show,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I willingly accept them all; I am resolved to go.</span><span class="t18"> {6.508}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">183. Through all the hill and forest grass, through clumps of bulrush reed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With my own breast I&rsquo;ll push my way, nor will complain indeed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">184. She that would keep a husband well must all her duties do;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14032"></a><span class="t12">Ready to roll up balls of dung,</span><a id="a14033"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17808"><span class="t19">{1707}</span></a><span class="t12"> ready for fasting too,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">185. She carefully must tend the fire, must mop up water still,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">186. The meanest harries her about; she eats of leavings still:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">187. Knocked down and smothered in the dust, haled roughly by the hair &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A man may do them any hurt, all simply stand and stare.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">188. Men pull about the widow&rsquo;s sons with cruel blows and foul,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though fair and proud of winning charm, as crows would peck an owl.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">189. Even in a prosperous household, bright with silver without end,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unkindly speeches never cease from brother or from friend.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">190. Naked are rivers waterless, a kingdom without king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A widow may have brothers ten, yet is a naked thing.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">191. A banner is the chariot&rsquo;s mark, a fire by smoke is known,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kingdoms by kings, a wedded wife by husband of her own.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">192. The wife who shares her husband&rsquo;s lot, be it rich or be it poor,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Her fame the very gods do praise, in trouble she is sure.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">193-194. My husband I will follow still, the yellow robe to wear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14034"></a><span class="t12">To be the queen</span><a id="a14035"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17810"><span class="t19">{1708}</span></a><span class="t12"> of all the earth without, I would not care.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O terrible is widowhood! Great monarch, go I will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">195. Those women have no heart at all, they&rsquo;re hard and cannot feel,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who when their husbands are in woe, desire to be in weal.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">196. When the great lord of Sivi land goes forth to banishment,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will go with him; for he gives all joy and all content.&rsquo;</span><span class="t18"> [6.264] {6.509}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">197. Then up and spake the mighty king to Maddī bright and fair:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;But leave your two children behind: for what can they do there,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Auspicious lady? We will keep and give them every care.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">198. Then Maddī answered to the king, that princess bright and fair:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;My Jāli and Kaṇhājinā are dearest to my heart:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They&rsquo;ll in the forest dwell with me, and they will ease my smart.&rsquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.510}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">199. Thus answer made the monarch great, thus Sivi&rsquo;s foster-king:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Fine rice has been their food and well-cooked viands hitherto:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If they must feed on wild tree fruit, what will the children do?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">200. From silver dishes well adorned or golden hitherto,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They ate: but with bare leaves instead what will the children do?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">201. Benares cloth has been their dress, or linen hitherto:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If they must dress in grass or bark, what will the children do?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">202. In carriages or palanquins they&rsquo;ve ridden hitherto</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When they must run about on foot, what will the children do?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">203. In gabled chambers they would sleep safe-bolted hitherto:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beneath the roots of trees to lie, what will the children do?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">204. On cushions, rugs or broidered beds they rested hitherto:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Reclining on a bed of grass, what will the children do?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">205. They have been sprinkled with sweet scents and perfumes hitherto:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When covered all with dust and dirt, what will the children do?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">206. When peacock&rsquo;s feathers, yak&rsquo;s tail fans have fanned them hitherto,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14036"></a><span class="t12">Bitten by insects and by flies, what will the children do?&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">As they conversed thus together, the dawn came, and after the dawn up rose the sun. They brought round for the Great Being a gorgeous carriage with a team of four Sindh horses, and stayed it at the door. Maddī did obeisance to her husband&rsquo;s parents, and, bidding farewell to the other women, took leave, and with her two children went before Vessantara and took her place in the carriage.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this matter, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">207. &ldquo;Then Maddī answered to the king, that lady bright and fair:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do not lament for us, my lord, nor be perplexèd so:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The children both will go with us wherever we shall go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">208. With these words Maddī went away, that lady bright and fair:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Along the highroad, and the two children her path did share.</span><span class="t18"> {6.511}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">209. Then king Vessantara himself, his vow performed as bound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Does reverence to his parents both, and passes rightwise round.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">210. Then, mounting in the chariot swift, drawn by its team of four,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With wife and children off he sped where Vaṅka&rsquo;s peak did soar.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">211. Then drove the king Vessantara where most the crowd did swell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And cried: &lsquo;We go! A blessing on my kinsfolk &ndash; fare you well!&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Addressing these words to the crowd, the Great Being admonished them to be careful, to give alms and do good deeds. As he went, the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s mother, saying: &ldquo;If my son desires to give, let him give,&rdquo; sent to him two carts, one on each side, filled with ornaments, laden with the seven precious things. In eighteen gifts he distributed to beggars he met on the road all he had, including even the mass of ornaments which he wore on his own body. When he had got away from the city, he turned <span class="t18">[6.265] </span>round and desired to look upon it; then according to his wish the earth cleft asunder to the measure of the chariot, and turning round, brought the chariot to face the city, and he beheld the place where his parents dwelt. So then followed earthquakes and other wonders; wherefore it is said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">212. &ldquo;When from the city he came forth, he turned again to look:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And, therefore, like a banyan tree great Mount Sineru shook.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And as he looked, he uttered a verse to induce Maddī to look also:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">213. &ldquo;See, Maddī, see the lovely place from which we now have come &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The king of Sivi&rsquo;s dwelling-house and our ancestral home!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{6.512}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being looking towards the sixty thousand courtiers, who were born when he was, and the rest of the people, made them turn back; and as he drove on with the carriage, he said to Maddī, &ldquo;Lady, look out and see if any suitors are walking behind.&rdquo; She sat watching. Now four brahmins, who had been unable to be present at the gift of the Seven Hundreds, had come to the city; and finding that the distribution was over, ascertained that the prince had gone. &ldquo;Did he take anything with him?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;Yes: a chariot.&rdquo; So they resolved to ask for the horses. These men Maddī saw approaching. &ldquo;Beggars, my lord!&rdquo; said she; the Great Being stayed the chariot. Up they came and asked for the horses: the Great Being gave them.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">214. &ldquo;Then did four brahmins catch him up, and for the horses plead:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He gave the horses on the spot &ndash; each beggar had one steed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The horses disposed of, the yoke of the chariot remained suspended in the air; but no sooner were the brahmins gone than four Devaputtas in the guise of red deer came and caught it. The Great Being who knew them to be Devaputtas uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">215. &ldquo;See, Maddī, what a wondrous thing &ndash; a marvel, Maddī, see!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">These clever horses, in the shape of red deer, drawing me!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But then as he went up came another brahmin and asked for the chariot. The Great Being dismounted his wife and children, and gave him the chariot; and when he gave the chariot, the Devaputtas disappeared.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain the gift of the chariot, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">216. &ldquo;A fifth came thereupon, and asked the chariot of the king:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He gave this also, and his heart to keep it did not cling.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">217. Then made the king Vessantara his people to dismount,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And gave the chariot to the man who came on that account.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.513}</span></p>
<p class="p6">After this, they all went on afoot. </p>
<p class="p7">Then the Great Being said to Maddī:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">218. &ldquo;Maddī, you take Kaṇhājinā, for she is light and young,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But Jāli is a heavy boy, so I&rsquo;ll bring him along.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[6.266]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then they took up the two children, and carried them on their hips.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">219. &ldquo;He carrying his boy, and she her daughter, on they went,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14037"></a><span class="t12">Talking together on the road in joy and all content.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx35899"></a>Entering the Forest</h4>
<p class="p7">When they met anyone coming to meet them along the road, they asked the way to Vaṅka hill, and learned that it was afar off. Thus it is said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">220. &ldquo;Whenever they met travellers coming along the way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They asked directions for their road, and where Mount Vaṅka lay.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">221. The travellers all wept full sore to see them on the way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And told them of their heavy task: &lsquo;The road is long, they say.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The children cried to see fruit of all kinds on the trees which grew on both sides of the road. Then by the Great Being&rsquo;s power, the trees bowed down their fruit so that their hands could reach it, and they picked out the ripest and gave it to the little ones. Then Maddī cried out, &ldquo;A marvel!&rdquo; Thus it is said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">222. &ldquo;Whene&rsquo;er the children did behold trees growing on the steep</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Laden with fruit, the children for the fruit began to weep.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">223. But when they saw the children weep, the tall trees sorrowful</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bowed down their branches to their hands, that they the fruit might pull.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">224. Then Maddī cried aloud in joy, that lady fair and bright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To see the marvel, fit to make one&rsquo;s hair to stand upright.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">225. One&rsquo;s hair might stand upright to see the marvel here is shown:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By power of king Vessantara the trees themselves bend down!&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.514}</span></p>
<p class="p6">From the city of Jetuttara, the mountain named Suvaṇṇagiritāla is five leagues distant; from thence the river Kontimārā is five leagues away, and five leagues more to Mount Arañjaragiri, five leagues again to the brahmin village of Dunniviṭṭha, thence ten leagues to his uncle&rsquo;s city: thus from Jetuttara the journey was thirty leagues. The gods shortened the journey, so that in one day they came to his uncle&rsquo;s city. Thus it is said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">226. &ldquo;The Yakkhas made the journey short, pitying the children&rsquo;s plight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And so to Ceta kingdom they arrived before the night.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now they left Jetuttara at breakfast time, and in the evening they came to the kingdom of Ceta and to his uncle&rsquo;s city.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">227. &ldquo;Away to Ceta they proceed, a journey great and long,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A kingdom rich in food and drink, and prosperous, and strong.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now in his uncle&rsquo;s city dwelt sixty thousand khattiyas. The Great Being entered not into the city, but sat in a hall at the city gate. Maddī brushed off the dust on the Great Being&rsquo;s feet, and rubbed them; then with a view to announce the coming of Vessantara, she went forth from <span class="t18">[6.267] </span>the hall, and stood within sight. So the women who came in and out of the city saw her and came round.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">228. &ldquo;Seeing the auspicious lady there the women round her throng.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The tender lady! Now afoot she needs must walk along.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">229. In palanquin or chariot once the noble lady rode:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now Maddī needs must go afoot; the woods are her abode.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.515}</span></p>
<p class="p6">All the people then, seeing Maddī and Vessantara and the children arrived in this unbecoming fashion, went and informed the king; and sixty thousand princes came to him weeping and lamenting.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">230. &ldquo;Seeing him, the Ceta princes came, with wailing and lament.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14038"></a><span class="t12">&lsquo;Greet you, my lord: we trust that you are prosperous and well,</span><a id="a14039"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17812"><span class="t19">{1709}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That of your father and his realm you have good news to tell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">231. Where is your army, mighty king? And where your royal car?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With not a chariot, not a horse, you now have journeyed far:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Were you defeated by your foes that here alone you are?&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being told the princes the cause of his coming:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">232. &ldquo;I thank you, sirs; be sure that I am prosperous and well;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And of my father and his realm I have good news to tell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14040"></a><span class="t12">233. I gave the saviour elephant, pole-tuskèd, goodly white,</span><a id="a14041"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17814"><span class="t19">{1710}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which ever knew the vantage-ground to choose in every fight;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">234. His jewels, and his yak&rsquo;s tail fan; which trampled down the foes,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Long-tuskèd, furious, white as Mount Kelāsa with his snows;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">235. With trappings and white parasol, fit riding for a king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With leech and driver: yes, I gave away this precious thing.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">236. Therefore the people were in wrath, my father took it ill:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Therefore he banished me, and I now go to Vaṅka hill.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I pray you, tell me of a place to be my dwelling still.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The princes answered:<span class="t18"> {6.516}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">237. &ldquo;Now welcome, welcome, mighty king, and with no doubtful voice:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be lord of all that here is found, and use it at your choice.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">238. Take herbs, roots, honey, meat, and rice, the whitest and the best:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Enjoy it at your will, O king, and you shall be our guest.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Vessantara said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">239. &ldquo;Your proffered gifts I here accept, with thanks for your goodwill.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But now the king has banished me; I go to Vaṅka hill.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I pray you, tell me of a place to be my dwelling still.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The princes said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">240. &ldquo;Stay here in Ceta, mighty king, until a message go</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To tell the king of Sivi land what we have come to know.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">241. Then they behind him in a throng escorting him did go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All full of joy and confidence: this I would have you know.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [6.268]</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">242. &ldquo;I would not have you send and tell the king that I am here:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He is not king in this affair: he has no power, I fear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">243. The palace folk and townsfolk all in wrath came gathering,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All eager that because of me they might destroy the king.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.517}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The princes said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">244. &ldquo;If in that kingdom came to pass so terrible a thing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Surrounded by the Ceta folk stay here, and be our king.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">245. The realm is prosperous and rich, the people strong and great:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be minded, sir, to stay with us and govern this our state.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Vessantara said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">246. &ldquo;Hear me, O sons of Ceta land! I have no mind to stay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As I go forth a banished man, nor here hold royal sway.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">247. The Sivi people one and all would be ill pleased to know</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That you had sprinkled me for king, as banished forth I go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">248. If you should do it, that would be a most unpleasant thing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To quarrel with the Sivi folk: I like not quarrelling.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">249-250. Your proffered gifts I here accept, with thanks for your goodwill.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But now the king has banished me: I go to Vaṅka hill.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I pray you, tell me of a place to be my dwelling still.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus the Great Being, in spite of so many requests, declined the kingdom. And the princes paid him great honour; but he would not enter within the city; so they adorned that hall where he was, and surrounded it with a screen, and preparing a great bed, they kept careful watch round about. One day and one night he lived in the hall well-guarded; and next day, early in the morning, after a meal of all manner of fine-flavoured food, attended by the princes, he left the hall, and sixty thousand Khattiyas went with him for fifteen leagues, <span class="t18">{6.518}</span> then standing at the entering in of the wood, they told of the fifteen leagues which yet remained of his journey.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">251. &ldquo;Yes, we will tell you how a king who leaves the world may be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Good, peaceful by his sacred fire, and all tranquillity.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">252. That rocky mountain, mighty king, is Gandhamādana,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where with your children and your wife together you may stay.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14042"></a><span class="t12">253. The Ceta folk, with faces all bewept and streaming eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Advise you to go northward straight where high its peaks uprise.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">254. There you shall see Mount Vipula (and blessing with you go),</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pleasant with many a growing tree that casts cool shade below.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">255. When you shall reach it, you shall see (a blessing with you still)</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ketumatī, a river deep and springing from the hill.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">256. Full of all fish, a safe resort, its deep flood flows away:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There you shall drink, and there shall bathe, and with your children play.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">257. And there, upon a pleasant hill, cool-shaded, you will see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Laden with fruit as honey sweet, a noble banyan tree.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">258. Then you will see Mount Nālika, and that is haunted ground:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For there the birds in concert sing and Kimpurisas abound.</span><span class="t18"> [6.269]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">259. There further still towards the north is Mucalinda lake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On which the lilies blue and white a covering do make.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">260. Then a thick forest, like a cloud, with grassy sward to tread,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Trees full of flowers and of fruit, all shady overhead,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Enter: a lion seeking prey wherewith he may be fed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">261. There when the forest is in flower, a shower of song is heard,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The twitter here and twitter there of many a bright-winged bird.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">262. And if those mountain cataracts you follow to their spring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14043"></a><span class="t12">You&rsquo;ll find a lily-covered lake with blossoms</span><a id="a14044"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17816"><span class="t19">{1711}</span></a><span class="t12"> flowering,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">263. Full of all fish, a safe resort, deep water without end,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Foursquare and peaceful, scented sweet, no odour to offend:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">264. There build yourself a leafy cell, a little to the north,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And from the cell which you shall make in search of food go forth.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.519}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the princes tell him of his fifteen-league journey, and let him go. But to prevent any fear of danger in Vessantara, and with a view to leave no hold for any adversary, they gave directions to a certain man of their country, wise and skilful, to keep an eye upon his goings and comings; whom they left at the entering in of the forest, and returned to their own city.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a14045"></a>And Vessantara with his wife and children proceeded to Gandhamādana; that day he abode there, then setting his face northwards he passed by the foot of Mount Vipula, and rested on the bank of the river Ketumatī, to eat a goodly repast provided by the forester, and there they bathed and drank, presenting their guide with a golden hairpin. With mind full of calmness he crossed the stream, and resting awhile under the banyan which stood on a flat space on the mountain, after eating its fruit, he rose up and went on to the hill called Nālika. Still moving onwards, he passed along the banks of lake Mucalinda to its northeastern corner: whence by a narrow footpath he penetrated<a id="a14046"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17818"><span class="t9">{1712}</span></a> into the thick forest, and passing through, he followed the course of the stream which rose out of the mountain until he came to the foursquare lake.</p>
<p class="p7">At this moment, Sakka, King of the Devas, looked down and beheld that which had happened. &ldquo;The Great Being,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;has entered the Himālayas, and he must have a place to dwell in.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{6.520}</span><a id="a14047"></a><a id="a14048"></a> So he gave orders to Vissakamma: &ldquo;Go, pray, and in the dells of Mount Vaṅka, build a hermitage on a pleasant spot.&rdquo; Vissakamma went and made two hermitages with two covered walks, rooms for the night and rooms for the day; alongside of the walks he plants rows of flowering trees and clumps of banana, and makes ready all things necessary for ascetics. Then he writes an inscription, &ldquo;Whoso wishes to be an ascetic, these are for him,&rdquo; and driving away all (malicious) Amanussas and all harsh-voiced beasts and birds, he went to his own place.<span class="t18"> [6.270]</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Great Being, when he beheld a path, felt sure that it must lead to some ascetics&rsquo; settlement. He left Maddī and the two children at the entrance of the hermitage, and went in; when seeing the inscription, he recognized that Sakka&rsquo;s eye was upon him. He opened the door and entered, and putting off his bow and sword, with the garments which he wore, he donned the garb of an ascetic, took up the staff, and coming forth entered the covered walk and paced up and down, and with the quietude of a Paccekabuddha approached his wife and children. Maddī fell at his feet in tears; then with him entering the hermitage, she went to her own cell and donned the ascetic dress. After this they made their children to do the like. Thus the four noble ascetics dwelt in the recesses of Mount Vaṅka.</p>
<p class="p7">Then Maddī asked a boon of the Great Being. &ldquo;My lord, do you stay here with the children, instead of going out in search of wild fruits; and let me go instead.&rdquo; Thenceforward she used to fetch the wild fruits from the forest and feed them all three. The Bodhisatta also asked her for a boon. &ldquo;Maddī, we are now ascetics; and woman is the canker of chastity. Henceforward then, do not approach me unseasonably.&rdquo; She consented.</p>
<p class="p7">By the power of the Great Being&rsquo;s compassion, even the wild animals, all that were within three leagues of their borders, had compassion one for another. </p>
<p class="p7">Daily at dawn, Maddī arises, provides water for their drinking and food to eat, brings water and toothbrush for cleansing the mouth, sweeps out the hermitage, leaves the two children with their father, basket, spade, and hook in hand <span class="t18">{6.521}</span><a id="a14049"></a> goes to the forest for wild roots and fruits, with which she fills her basket: at evening she returns, lays the wild fruits in the cell, washes the children; then the four of them sit at the door of the cell and eat their fruits. Then Maddī takes her two<a id="a14050"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17820"><span class="t9">{1713}</span></a><a id="a14051"></a> children, and retires to her own cell. Thus they lived in the recesses of the mountain for seven months.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx36048"></a>Jūjaka</h4>
<p class="p7">At that time, in the kingdom of Kāliṅga, and in a brahmin village named Dunniviṭṭha, lived a brahmin Jūjaka. He by quest of alms having obtained a hundred rupees deposited them with a certain brahmin family, and went out to get more wealth. As he was long away, the family spent that money; the other came back and upbraided them, but they could not return the money, and so they gave him their daughter named Amittatāpanā.<a id="a14052"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17822"><span class="t9">{1714}</span></a><a id="a14053"></a> He took the maiden with him to Dunniviṭṭha, in Kāliṅga, and there dwelt. Amittatāpanā tended the brahmin well. Some other brahmins, young men, seeing her dutifulness, reproached their own wives with it, &ldquo;See how carefully she tends an old man, while you are careless of your young husbands!&rdquo; This made the wives resolve to drive her out <span class="t18">[6.271] </span>of the village. So they would gather in crowds at the river side and everywhere else, reviling her.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">265. &ldquo;Once in Kāliṅga, Jūjaka a brahmin spent his life,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who had Amittatāpanā, quite a young girl, to wife.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">266. The women who with waterpots down to the river came,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cried shame upon her, crowding up, and roundly cursed her name.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14054"></a><span class="t12">267. A foe indeed your mother was, a foe your father too,</span><a id="a14055"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17824"><span class="t19">{1715}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To let an old decrepit man wed a young wife like you.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">268-271. Your people brewed a secret plot, a bad, mean, cruel plan,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To let a fine young girl be wed to an old decrepit man.</span><span class="t18"> {6.522}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">272. A hateful thing your life must be, as youthful as you are,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With an old husband to be wed; nay, death were better far.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">273. It surely seems, my pretty one, your parents were unkind</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If for a fine young girl they could no other husband find.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14056"></a><span class="t12">274. Your fire-oblation, and your ninth</span><a id="a14057"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17826"><span class="t19">{1716}</span></a><span class="t12"> were offered all for naught</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If by an old decrepit man so young a wife was caught.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">275. Some brahmin or ascetic once no doubt you have reviled,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Some virtuous or learned man, some ascetic undefiled,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If by an old decrepit man so young a wife was caught.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">276. Painful a spear-thrust, full of pain the serpent&rsquo;s fiery bite:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But a decrepit husband is more painful to the sight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">277. With an old husband there can be no joy and no delight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No pleasant talk: his very laugh is ugly to the sight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">278. When men and maidens, youth with youth, hold intercourse apart</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They make an end of all the woes that harbour in the heart.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">279. You are a girl whom men desire, you&rsquo;re young and you are fair:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How can an old man give you joy? Go home and tarry there!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When she heard their mockery, she went home with her waterpot, weeping. &ldquo;Why are you weeping?&rdquo; the husband asked; and she replied in this verse:<span class="t18"> {6.523}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">280. &ldquo;I cannot fetch the water home, the women mock me so:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Because my husband is so old they mock me when I go.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Jūjaka said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">281. &ldquo;You need not fetch the water home, you need not serve me so:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do not be angry, lady mine: for I myself will go.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The woman said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">282. &ldquo;You fetch the water? No, indeed! That&rsquo;s not our usual way.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I tell you plainly, if you do, with you I will not stay.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">283. Unless you buy a slave or maid this kind of work to do,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I tell you plainly I will go and will not live with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Jūjaka said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">284. &ldquo;How can I buy a slave? I have no craft, no corn, no pelf:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come, be not angry, lady mine: I&rsquo;ll do your work myself.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[6.272]</span></p>
<p class="p6">The woman said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">285. &ldquo;Come now, and let me tell to you what I have heard them say.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Out yonder in the Vaṅka hill lives king Vessantara:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">286. Go, husband, to Vessantara and ask him for a slave;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The prince will certainly consent to give you what you crave.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Jūjaka said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">287. &ldquo;I am an old decrepit man; the road is rough and long;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But do not worry, do not weep &ndash; and I am far from strong:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But be not angry, lady mine: I&rsquo;ll do the work myself.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{6.524}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The woman said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">288. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like a soldier who gives in before the fight: but why?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14058"></a><span class="t12">And do you own that you are beat before you go</span><a id="a14059"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17828"><span class="t19">{1717}</span></a><span class="t12"> and try?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">289. Unless you buy a slave or maid this kind of work to do,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I tell you plainly, I will go, I will not live with you.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That will be a most unpleasant thing, a painful thing for you.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">290. When happy in another&rsquo;s arms you shall behold me soon,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dressed gaily at the season&rsquo;s change, or changes of the moon.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">291. And as in your declining years my absence you deplore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your wrinkles and your hoary hairs will double more and more.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">292. &ldquo;And now the brahmin full of fears to his wife&rsquo;s will gives way;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So then tormented by his love, you might have heard him say:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">293. &lsquo;Get me provision for the road: make me some honey-cake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Prepare some bannocks too, and set the barley-bread to bake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14060"></a><span class="t12">294. And then an equal</span><a id="a14061"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17830"><span class="t19">{1718}</span></a><span class="t12"> pair of slaves with me I&rsquo;ll bring away,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who without wearying shall wait upon you night and day.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Quickly she prepared the provision, and informed him that it was done. Meanwhile he repairs the weak places about his cottage, secures the door, brings in wood from the forest, draws water in the pitcher, fills all the pots and pans, and donning the garb of the ascetic he leaves her with the words, &ldquo;Be sure not to go out at improper times, and be careful until I return.&rdquo; Then putting on his shoes, he puts his bag of provisions over his shoulder, walks round his wife rightwise, and departs with streaming eyes.<span class="t18"> {6.525}</span></p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">295. &ldquo;This done, the brahmin dons his shoes; then rising presently,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And walking round her towards the right he bids his wife good-bye.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">296. So went he, dressed in holiness, tears standing in his eyes:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To the rich Sivi capital to find a slave he hies.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When he came to that city, he asked the assembled people where Vessantara was. <span class="t18">[6.273]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">297. &ldquo;When further he had come, he asked the people gathered round:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Say, where is king Vessantara? Where can the prince be found?&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To him replied the multitude who were assembled round:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">298. &lsquo;By such as you he&rsquo;s ruined; for by giving, giving still,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He&rsquo;s banished out of all the realm and dwells in Vaṅka hill.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">299. By such as you he&rsquo;s ruined; for by giving, giving still,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He took his wife and children and now dwells in Vaṅka hill.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;So you have destroyed our king, and now come here again! Stand still, will you,&rdquo; and with sticks and clods, kicks and fisticuffs, they chased him away. But he was guided by the gods into the right road for Vaṅka hill.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">300. &ldquo;So he, upbraided by his wife, in greedy passion&rsquo;s sway,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Paid for his error in the wood where beasts and panthers prey.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">301. Taking his staff and begging-bowl and sacrificial spoon,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He sought the forest where abode the giver of every boon.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">302. Once in the forest, came the wolves thronging around his way:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14062"></a><span class="t12">He leapt aside, and went confused far from the path astray.</span><a id="a14063"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17832"><span class="t19">{1719}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">303. This brahmin of unbridled greed, finding himself astray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The way to Vaṅka now quite lost, began these lines to say:</span><span class="t18"> {6.526}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">304. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;ll tell me of Vessantara, the prince all conquering,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Giver of peace in time of fear, the great and mighty king?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">305. Refuge of suitors, as the earth to all that living be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who&rsquo;ll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">306. All who seek favours go to him as rivers to the sea:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who&rsquo;ll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">307. Like to a safe and pleasant lake, with water fresh and cool,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With lilies spread, whose filaments cover the quiet pool:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who&rsquo;ll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">308. Like a great fig tree on the road, which growing there has made</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A rest for weary wayfarers who hasten to its shade:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who&rsquo;ll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">309-310. Like Banyan, Sāl, or Mango tree, which on the road has made</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A rest for weary wayfarers that hasten to its shade:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who&rsquo;ll tell me of Vessantara, the great and mighty king?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">311-312. Who will give ear to my complaint, the forest all around?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Glad I should be, could anyone tell where he may be found!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">313-314. Who will give ear to my complaint, the forest all around?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Great blessing it would be, if one could tell where he may be found.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.527}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now the man who had been set to watch, who was ranging the woods as a forester, heard this lamentable outcry; and thought he: <span class="t18">[6.274]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Here is a brahmin crying out about Vessantara&rsquo;s dwelling-place; he cannot be here for any good purpose. He will ask for Maddī or the children, no doubt. Well, I will kill him.&rdquo; So he approached the man, and as he drew his bow, threatened him with the words, &ldquo;Brahmin, I will not spare your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">315. &ldquo;The hunter ranging in the wood heard this lament, and said:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By such as you he&rsquo;s ruined; for by giving, giving still,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He&rsquo;s banished out of all the realm and dwells in Vaṅka hill.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">316. By such as you he&rsquo;s ruined; for by giving, giving still,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He took his wife and children and now dwells in Vaṅka hill.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">317. A good-for-nothing fool you are, if leaving home you wish</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To seek the prince in forests, like a crane that seeks a fish.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">318. Therefore, my worthy man, I will not spare your life; and so</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My arrow now shall drink your blood when shot from out my bow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">319. I&rsquo;ll split your head, tear out your heart and liver in a trice,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like birds to spirits of the road I&rsquo;ll make you sacrifice.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">320. I&rsquo;ll take your flesh, I&rsquo;ll take your fat, I&rsquo;ll take your heart and head,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14064"></a><span class="t12">And you shall be a sacrifice</span><a id="a14065"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17834"><span class="t19">{1720}</span></a><span class="t12"> as soon as you are dead.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">321. You&rsquo;ll be a welcome sacrifice, a goodly offering;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And then you&rsquo;ll not destroy the wife and children of the king.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.528}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The brahmin, on hearing these words, was frightened to death, and made a false reply.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">322. &ldquo;The ambassador&rsquo;s inviolate, and no man may him kill:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This is a very ancient rule; so listen, if you will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">323. The people have repented them, his father misses him,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His mother pines away for grief &ndash; her eyes are waxing dim.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">324. I come as their ambassador, Vessantara to bring:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hear me, and tell me if you know where I may find the king.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the man was pleased to hear that he was come to fetch Vessantara; he fastened up his dogs, and called the brahmin down, and seating him upon a pile of twigs he recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">325. &ldquo;I love the envoy and the prince: and here I give to you</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A gift of welcome &ndash; leg of deer and pot of honey too;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Our benefactor how to find I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx36229"></a><a id="a14066"></a>The Small Wood</h4>
<p class="p7">So saying, the man gave the brahmin food, with a gourd of honey and a roast leg of deer, and set him on his way, raising his right hand to point out the place where the Great Being lived: and he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14067"></a><a id="a14068"></a><span class="t12">326. &ldquo;Sir brahmin, yonder rocky mount is Gandhamādan hill</span></p>

<p class="p13"><a id="a14069"></a><span class="t12">327. With brahmin&rsquo;s dress, with hook</span><a id="a14070"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17836"><span class="t19">{1721}</span></a><span class="t12"> and spoon, the ascetic&rsquo;s matted hair,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14072"></a><span class="t12">329. There shrubs, and creepers, horsear, sāl, and many another tree</span><a id="a14073"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17840"><span class="t19">{1722}</span></a></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Welcome the guest, delighting all who make the woods their home,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where with his children now abides Vessantara the king.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Skinclad he lies upon the ground, and tends the fire with care.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Moreover he said, in praise of the hermitage:</p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">336. The mango trees are some in flower, some with the fruit just set,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">337. A man may stand beneath the trees and pluck them as they grow:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The choicest flavour, colour, taste, both ripe and unripe show.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">338. It makes me cry aloud to see that great and wondrous sight,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And honey drips like milk or ghee from the flowers one and all.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">346. A frequent breeze blows through the trees where every scent is found,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And seems to intoxicate with flowers the forest all around.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">347. The bees about the scented flowers fly thronging with their hum,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There fly the many-coloured birds together, all and some,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cooing and chirping in delight, each with his mate they come.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">348. O pretty chicky, happy chap! They twitter and they tweet:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14087"></a><span class="t12">&lsquo;O lovey dovey, deary dear, my pretty little sweet!&rsquo;</span><a id="a14088"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17855"><span class="t19">{1728}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">349. Festoons of flowers garlanded as when the banners fly,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Blossoms of every hue and tint, sweet odours wafted by,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where with his children now abides Vessantara the king.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">350. With brahmin&rsquo;s dress, with hook and spoon, the ascetic&rsquo;s matted hair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Skinclad he lies upon the ground and tends the fire with care.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.531}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the countryman describe the place where Vessantara lived; and Jūjaka, delighted, saluted him in this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">351. &ldquo;Accept this piece of barley-bread all soaked with honey sweet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And lumps of well-cooked honey-cake: I give it you to eat.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this the countryman answered:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">352. &ldquo;I thank you, but I have no need: keep your provision still;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And take of my provision; then go, brahmin, where you will. </span><span class="t18">{6.532}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">353. Straight onward to a hermitage the pathway there will lead,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where Accata an ascetic dwells, black-toothed, with dirty head,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With brahmin dress, with hook and spoon, the ascetic&rsquo;s matted hair,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">354. Skinclad he lies upon the ground and tends the fire with care:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Go there, ask the way of him, and he will give you speed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">355. When this he heard, the brahmin walked round Ceta towards the right,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And went in search of Accata, his heart in high delight.</span></p>
