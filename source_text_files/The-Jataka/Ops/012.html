<h2 class="h21"><a id="a289"></a>Nidānakathā<br/>Introduction</h2>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">vv. 1-11. </span><a id="a290"></a><span class="t18">[1.1] {1.1}</span><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t12">The Apaṇṇaka and other Jātaka Stories, which in times gone by were recounted on various occasions by the great illustrious Sage, and in which during a long period our Teacher and Leader, desiring the salvation of mankind, fulfilled the vast conditions of Buddhahood,</span><a id="a291"></a><a href="notes.html#a14270"><span class="t19">{32}</span></a><span class="t12"> were all collected together and added to the canon of Dhamma by those who made the recension, and rehearsed them under the name of the Jātaka. Having bowed at the feet of the Great Sage, the lord of the world, by whom in innumerable existences</span><a id="a292"></a><a href="notes.html#a14272"><span class="t19">{33}</span></a><a id="a293"></a><span class="t12"> boundless benefits were conferred upon mankind, and having paid reverence to the Dhamma, and ascribed honour to the Saṅgha, the receptacle of all honour; and having removed all dangers by the efficacy of that meritorious act of veneration and honour referring to the Three Jewels, I proceed to recite a Commentary upon this Jātaka, illustrating as it does the infinite efficacy of the actions of great men &ndash; a commentary based upon the method of exposition current among the inmates of the Great Monastery [Mahāvihāra</span><a id="a294"></a><a href="notes.html#a14274"><span class="t19">{34}</span></a><span class="t12">]. And I do so at the personal request of the elder Atthadassī, who lives apart from the world and </span><span class="t18">[1.2]</span><span class="t4"> </span><a id="a295"></a><span class="t12">ever dwells with his fraternity, and who desires the perpetuation of this chronicle of Buddha; and likewise of Buddhamitta the tranquil and wise, sprung from the race of Mahiṁsāsaka,</span><a id="a296"></a><a href="notes.html#a14276"><span class="t19">{35}</span></a><span class="t12"> skilled in the canons of interpretation; and moreover of the monk Buddhadeva of clear intellect. May all good men lend me their favourable attention while I speak!</span><a id="a297"></a><a href="notes.html#a14278"><span class="t19">{36}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{1.2}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Inasmuch as this comment on the Jātaka, if it be expounded after setting forth the three Epochs, the distant, the middle, and proximate, will be clearly understood by those who hear it by being understood from the beginning, therefore I will expound it after setting forth the three Epochs. Accordingly from the very outset it will be well to determine the limits of these Epochs. Now the narrative of the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s existence, from the time that, at the feet of Buddha Dīpaṅkara, he formed a resolution to become a Buddha to his rebirth in the Tusita heaven after leaving the Vessantara existence, is called the Distant Epoch. From his leaving the Tusita heaven to his attainment of omniscience on the throne of Awakening, the narrative is called the Intermediate Epoch. And the Proximate Epoch is to be found in the various places in which he sojourned (during his ministry on earth).</p>
<p class="p7">The following is:</p>
<h3 class="h30"><a id="ncx728"></a><a id="a298"></a><a id="a299"></a><a id="a300"></a><a id="a301"></a>I The Distant Epoch</h3>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx729"></a>[The Story of Sumedha]</h4>
<p class="p7">Tradition tells us that four asaṅkheyyas<a id="a302"></a><a href="notes.html#a14280"><span class="t9">{37}</span></a> and a hundred thousand cycles ago there was a city called Amaravatī. In this city there dwelt a brahmin named Sumedha, of good family on both sides, on the father&rsquo;s and the <span class="t18">[1.3]</span> mother&rsquo;s side, of pure conception for seven generations back, by birth unreproached and respected, a man comely, well-favoured and amiable, and endowed with remarkable beauty. He followed his brahminical studies without engaging in any other pursuit.</p>
<p class="p7">His parents died while he was still young. A minister of state, who acted as steward of his property, bringing forth the roll-book of his estate, threw open the stores filled with gold and silver, gems and pearls, and other valuables, and said: &ldquo;So much, young man, belonged to your mother, so much to your father, so much to your grandparents and great-grandparents,&rdquo; and pointing out to him the property inherited through seven generations, he bade him guard it carefully. The wise Sumedha thought to himself, &ldquo;After amassing all this wealth my parents and ancestors when they went to another world took not a farthing with them, can it be right that I should make it an object to take my wealth with me when I go?&rdquo; And informing the king of his intention, he caused proclamation to be made<a id="a303"></a><a href="notes.html#a14282"><span class="t9">{38}</span></a> in the city, gave largess to the people, and embraced the ascetic life.</p>
<p class="p7">To make this matter clear the Story of Sumedha must here be related. This story, though given in full in the Buddhavaṁsa, from its being in a metrical form, is not very easy to understand. I will therefore relate it with sentences at intervals explaining the metrical construction.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a304"></a>Four asaṅkheyyas and a hundred thousand cycles ago there was a city called Amaravatī or Amara, resounding with the ten city cries, concerning which it is said in Buddhavaṁsa, <span class="t18">{1.3}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;Four asaṅkheyyas and a hundred thousand cycles ago</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There was a city called Amara, beautiful and pleasant,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Resounding with the ten cries, abounding in food and drink.&rdquo;</span><a id="a305"></a><a href="notes.html#a14284"><span class="t19">{39}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">[1.4]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then follows a verse of Buddhavaṁsa, enumerating some of these cries,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;The trumpeting of elephants, the neighing of horses, (the sound of) drums, trumpets, and chariots,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And viands and drinks were cried, with the invitation: Eat and drink.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">It goes on to say,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;A city supplied with every requisite, engaged in every sort of industry,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Possessing the seven precious things, thronged with dwellers of many races.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The abode of devout men, like the prosperous city of the Devas.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;In the city of Amaravatī dwelt a brahmin named Sumedha,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whose hoard was many tens of millions, blest with much wealth and store;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. Studious, knowing the Mantras, versed in the three Vedas,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Teacher of the science of divination and of the traditions and observances of his caste.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now one day the wise Sumedha, having retired to the splendid upper apartment of his house, seated himself cross-legged, and started thinking. &ldquo;Oh! Wise man,<a id="a306"></a><a href="notes.html#a14286"><span class="t9">{40}</span></a> grievous is rebirth in a new existence, and the dissolution of the body in each successive place where we are reborn. I am subject to birth, to decay, to disease, to death &ndash; it is right, being such, that I should strive to attain the great deathless Nibbāna, which is tranquil, and free from birth, and decay, and sickness, and grief and joy; surely there must be a road that leads to Nibbāna and releases man from existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Accordingly it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;Seated in seclusion, I then thought as follows:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Grievous is rebirth and the breaking up of the body.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. I am subject to birth, to decay, to disease,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Therefore will I seek Nibbāna, free from decay and death, and secure.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. Let me leave this perishable body, this pestilent congregation of vapours,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And depart without desires and without wants. </span><span class="t18">{1.4}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. There is, there must be a road, it cannot but be:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will seek this road, that I may obtain release from existence.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[1.5]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Further he reasoned thus, &ldquo;For as in this world there is pleasure as the correlative of pain, so where there is existence there must be its opposite the cessation of existence; and as where there is heat there is also cold which neutralizes it, so there must be a Nibbāna<a id="a307"></a><a href="notes.html#a14288"><span class="t9">{41}</span></a> that extinguishes (the fires of) lust and the other passions; and as in opposition to a bad and evil condition there is a good and blameless one, so where there is evil birth there must also be Nibbāna, called the birthless, because it puts an end to all rebirth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. &ldquo;As where there is suffering there is also bliss,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So where there is existence we must look for non-existence.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. And as where there is heat there is also cold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So where there is the threefold fire of passion extinction must be sought.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. And as coexistent with evil there is also good,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Even so where there is birth</span><a id="a308"></a><a href="notes.html#a14290"><span class="t19">{42}</span></a><span class="t12"> the cessation of birth should be sought.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Again he reasoned thus, &ldquo;Just as a man who has fallen into a heap of filth, if he beholds afar off a great pond covered with lotuses of five colours, ought to seek that pond, saying, &lsquo;By what way shall I arrive there?&rsquo; But if he does not seek it the fault is not that of the pond; even so where there is the lake of the great deathless Nibbāna for the washing of the defilement of sin, if it is not sought it is not the fault of the lake. And just as a man who is surrounded by robbers, if when there is a way of escape he does not fly it is not the fault of the way but of the man; even so when there is a blessed road loading to Nibbāna for the man who is encompassed and held fast by sin, its not being sought is not the fault of the road but of the person. And as a man who is oppressed with sickness, there being a physician who can heal his disease, if he does not get <span class="t18">[1.6]</span> cured by going to the physician that is no fault of the physician; even so if a man who is oppressed by the disease of sin seeks not a spiritual guide who is at hand and knows the road which puts an end to sin, the fault lies with him and not with the sin-destroying teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. &ldquo;As a man fallen among filth, beholding a brimming lake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If he seek not that lake, the fault is not in the lake;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. So when there exists a lake of Nibbāna that washes the stains of sin,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If a man seek not that lake, the fault is not in the lake of Nibbāna. </span><span class="t18">{1.5}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. As a man beset with foes, there being a way of escape,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If he flee not away, the fault is not with the road;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. So when there is a way of bliss, if a man beset with sin</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seek not that road, the fault is not in the way of bliss.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">28. And as one who is diseased, there being a physician at hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If he bid him not heal the disease, the fault is not in the healer:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">29. So if a man who is sick and oppressed with defilements</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seek not the spiritual teacher, the fault is not in the teacher.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a309"></a>And again he argued, &ldquo;As a man fond of adornment, throwing off a corpse bound to his shoulders, goes away rejoicing, so must I, throwing off this perishable body, and freed from all desires, enter the city of Nibbāna. And as men and women depositing filth on a dungheap do not gather it in the fold or skirt of their garments, but loathing it, throw it away, feeling no desire for it; so shall I also cast off this perishable body without regret, and enter the deathless city of Nibbāna. And as seamen abandon without regret an unseaworthy ship and escape, so will I also, leaving this body, which distils corruption from its nine festering apertures, enter without regret the city of Nibbāna. And as a man carrying various sorts of jewels, and going on the same road with a band of robbers, out of fear of losing his jewels withdraws from them and gains a safe road; even so this impure body is like a jewel-plundering robber, if I set my affections thereon the precious spiritual jewel of the sublime path of holiness will be lost to me, therefore <span class="t18">[1.7]</span> ought I to enter the city of Nibbāna, forsaking this robber-like body.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">30. &ldquo;As a man might with loathing shake off a corpse bound upon his shoulders,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And depart secure, independent, master of himself;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">31. Even so let me depart, regretting nothing, wanting nothing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Leaving this perishable body, this collection of many foul vapours.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">32. And as men and women deposit filth upon a dungheap,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And depart regretting nothing, wanting nothing,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">33. So will I depart, leaving this body filled with foul vapours,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As one leaves a cesspool after depositing ordure there.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">34. And as the owners forsake the rotten bark that is shattered and leaking,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And depart without regret or longing, </span><span class="t18">{1.6}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">35. So shall I go, leaving this body with its nine apertures ever running,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As its owners desert the broken ship.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. And as a man carrying wares, walking with robbers,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seeing danger of losing his wares, parts company with the robbers and gets him gone,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. Even so is this body like a mighty robber &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Leaving it I will depart through fear of losing good.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Having thus in nine similes pondered upon the advantages connected with retirement from the world, the wise Sumedha gave away at his own house, as aforesaid, an immense hoard of treasure to the indigent and wayfarers and sufferers, and kept open house. And renouncing all pleasures, both material and sensual, departing from the city of Amara, away from the world in the Himālayas he made himself a hermitage near the mountain called Dhammaka, and built a hut and a perambulation hall free from the five defects which are hindrances (to meditation). And with a view to obtain the power residing in the Super Knowledges, which are characterized by the eight causal qualities described in the words beginning, &ldquo;With a mind thus tranquillised, [purified and cleansed, unblemished, free from impurities, malleable, workable, established and having gained imperturbability]&rdquo;<a id="a310"></a><a href="notes.html#a14293"><span class="t9">{43}</span></a> he embraced in that <span class="t18">[1.8]</span> hermitage the ascetic life of a Sage, casting off the cloak with its nine disadvantages, and wearing the garment of bark with its twelve advantages. And when he had thus given up the world, forsaking this hut, crowded with eight drawbacks, he repaired to the foot of a tree with its ten advantages, and rejecting all sorts of grain lived constantly upon wild fruits. And strenuously exerting himself both in sitting and in standing and in walking, within a week he became the possessor of the eight Attainments and the five Super Knowledges; and so, in accordance with his prayer, he attained the might of the Super Knowledges.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. &ldquo;Having pondered thus I gave many thousand millions of wealth</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To rich and poor, and made my way to the Himālayas.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">39. Not far from the Himālayas is the mountain called Dhammaka,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here I made an excellent hermitage, and built with care a leafy hut.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">40. There I built a cloister, free from five defects,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Possessed of the eight good qualities, and attained the strength of the Super Knowledges.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">41. Then I threw off the cloak possessed of the nine faults,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And put on the raiment of bark possessed of the twelve advantages.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">42. I left the hut, crowded with the eight drawbacks,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And went to the foot of the tree, which is possessed of ten advantages.</span><a id="a311"></a><a href="notes.html#a14296"><span class="t19">{44}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">43. Wholly did I reject the grain that is sown and planted,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And partook of the constant fruits of the earth, possessed of many advantages. </span><span class="t18">{1.7}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">44. Then I strenuously strove, in sitting, in standing, and in walking,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a312"></a><span class="t12">And within seven days attained the strength of the Super Knowledges.&rdquo;</span><a id="a313"></a><a href="notes.html#a14298"><span class="t19">{45}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{1.10}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now while the ascetic Sumedha, having thus attained the strength of the Super Knowledges, was living in the bliss of the (eight) Attainments, the teacher Dīpaṅkara appeared in the world. At the moment of his conception, of his birth, of his attainment of Buddhahood, of his preaching his first discourse, the whole universe <span class="t18">[1.9]</span><a id="a314"></a> of ten thousand worlds <span class="t18">{1.11}</span> trembled, shook and quaked, and gave forth a mighty sound, and the thirty-two prognostics showed themselves. But the ascetic Sumedha, living in the bliss of the Attainments, neither heard that sound nor beheld those signs.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">45. &ldquo;Thus when I had attained the consummation, while I was subject to the dispensation,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The Conqueror named Dīpaṅkara, chief of the universe, appeared.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">46. At his conception, at his birth, at his Buddhahood, at his preaching,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I saw not the four signs, plunged as I was in the delight of Absorption.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a315"></a><a id="a316"></a>At that time Dīpaṅkara, the One with Ten Powers, accompanied by a hundred thousand saints, wandering his way from place to place, reached the city of Ramma, and took up his residence in the great monastery of Sudassana. And the dwellers of the city of Ramma heard it said: &ldquo;Dīpaṅkara, lord of ascetics, having become a supreme Buddha, and set on foot the wheel of the Dhamma, wandering his way from place to place, has come to the town of Ramma, and dwells at the great monastery of Sudassana.&rdquo; And taking with them ghee and butter and other medicinal requisites and clothes and raiment, and bearing perfumes and garlands and other offerings in their hands, their minds bent towards the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, inclining towards them, hanging upon them, they approached the teacher and worshipped him, and presenting the perfumes and other offerings, sat down on one side. And having heard his preaching of the Dhamma, and invited him for the next day, they rose from their seats and departed. And on the next day, having prepared almsgiving for the poor, and having decked out the town, they repaired the road by which the One with Ten Powers was to come, throwing earth in the places that were worn away by water and thereby levelling the surface, and scattering sand that looked like strips of silver. And they sprinkled fragrant roots and flowers, and raised aloft flags and banners of many-coloured cloths, and set up banana <span class="t18">[1.10]</span> arches and rows of brimming jars.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the ascetic Sumedha, ascending from his hermitage, and proceeding through the air till he was above those men, and beholding the joyous multitude, exclaimed, &ldquo;What can be the reason?&rdquo; Alighting, he stood on one side and questioned the people, &ldquo;Tell me, why are you adorning this road?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a317"></a><span class="t12">47. &ldquo;In the region of the border districts, having invited the Tathāgata,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With joyful hearts they are clearing the road by which he should come.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">48. And I at that time leaving my hermitage,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Rustling my barken tunic, departed through the air.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">49. And seeing an excited multitude joyous and delighted,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Descending from the air I straightway asked the men, </span><span class="t18">{1.12}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">50. The people are excited, joyous and happy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For whom is the road being cleared, the path, the way of his coming?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a318"></a><a id="a319"></a><a id="a320"></a>And the men replied, &ldquo;Lord Sumedha, do you not know? Dīpaṅkara, the One with Ten Powers, having attained supreme Awakening, and set rolling the Dhamma wheel, travelling from place to place, has reached our town, and dwells at the great monastery Sudassana; we have invited the Fortunate One, and are making ready for the fortunate Buddha the road by which he is to come.&rdquo; And the ascetic Sumedha thought: &ldquo;The very sound of the word Buddha is rarely met with in the world, much more the actual appearance of One with Ten Powers; it behoves me to join those men in clearing the road.&rdquo; He said therefore to the men, &ldquo;If you are clearing this road for the Buddha, assign to me a piece of ground, I will clear the ground in company with you.&rdquo; They consented, said: &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; and perceiving the ascetic Sumedha to be possessed of Supernormal Power, they fixed upon a swampy piece of ground, and assigned it to him, saying: &ldquo;Prepare this spot.&rdquo; Sumedha, his heart filled with joy of which the Buddha was the cause, thought within himself, &ldquo;I am able to prepare <span class="t18">[1.11]</span><a id="a321"></a> this piece of ground by my Supernormal Power, but if so prepared it will give me no satisfaction; this day it behoves me to perform menial duties,&rdquo; and fetching earth he threw it upon the spot.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a322"></a>But ere the ground could be cleared by him &ndash; with a train of a hundred thousand miracle-working saints endowed with the six Super Knowledges, while Devas offered celestial wreaths and perfumes, while celestial hymns rang forth, and men paid their homage with earthly perfumes and with flowers and other offerings, Dīpaṅkara, the One with Ten Powers, with all a Buddha&rsquo;s transcendant majesty, like a lion rousing himself to seek his prey on the Vermilion plain, came down into the road all decked and made ready for him.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a323"></a>Then the ascetic Sumedha &ndash; as the One with Ten Powers with unblenching eyes approached along the road prepared for him, beholding that form endowed with the perfection of beauty, adorned with the thirty-two characteristics of a great man, and marked with the eighty minor marks, attended by a halo of a fathom&rsquo;s depth, and sending forth in streams the six-hued Buddha-rays, linked in pairs of different colours, and wreathed like the varied lightnings that flash in the gem-studded vault of heaven &ndash; exclaimed, &ldquo;This day it behoves me to make sacrifice of my life for the One with Ten Powers: let not the Blessed one walk in the mire &ndash; nay, let him advance with his four hundred thousand saints trampling on my body as if walking upon a bridge of jewelled planks, this deed will long be for my good and my happiness.&rdquo; So saying, he loosed his hair, and <span class="t18">{1.13}</span> spreading in the inky mire his ascetic&rsquo;s skin mantle, roll of matted hair and garment of bark, he lay down in the mire like a bridge of jewelled planks.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">51. &ldquo;Questioned by me they replied, &lsquo;An incomparable Buddha is born into the world,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The Conqueror named Dīpaṅkara, lord of the universe,</span></p>
<p class="p6">For him the road is cleared, the way, the path of his coming.&rsquo; <span class="t18">[1.12 ]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">52. When I heard the name of Buddha joy sprang up forthwith within me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Repeating, &lsquo;a Buddha, a Buddha!&rsquo; I gave utterance to my joy.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">53. Standing there I pondered, joyful and excited,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here I will sow the seed, may the happy moment not pass away.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">54. &lsquo;If you clear a path for the Buddha, assign to me a place,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I also will clear the road, the way, the path of his coming.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">55. Then they gave me a piece of ground to clear the pathway;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then repeating within me, &lsquo;a Buddha, a Buddha!&rsquo; I cleared the road.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">56. But ere my portion was cleared, Dīpaṅkara the great sage,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The Conqueror, entered the road with four hundred thousand saints like himself,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Possessed of the six Super Knowledges, pure from all taint of wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">57. On every side men rose to receive him, many drums sent forth their music,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Men and Devas were overjoyed, shouting forth their applause.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">58. Devas look upon men, men upon Devas,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And both with clasped hands upraised approach the Tathāgata.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">59. Devas with celestial music, men with earthly music,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a324"></a><span class="t12">Both sending forth their strains approach the Tathāgata.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">60. Devas floating in the air sprinkle down in all directions</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Celestial Erythrina flowers, lotuses and coral flowers.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">61. Men standing on the ground throw upwards in all directions</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Champac and Salaḷa flowers, Kadamba and fragrant Mesua, PunNāga, and Ketaka.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">62. Then I loosed my hair, and spreading in the mire</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bark robe and mantle of skin, lay prone upon my face.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">63. Let the Buddha advance with his disciples, treading upon me;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let him not tread in the mire, it will be for my blessing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a325"></a>And as he lay in the mire, again beholding the Buddha-majesty of Dīpaṅkara, the One with Ten Powers, with his unblenching gaze, he thought as follows, &ldquo;Were I willing, I could enter the city of Ramma as a novice in the priesthood, after having destroyed all human passions; <span class="t18">{1.14} </span>but why should I disguise myself<a id="a326"></a><a href="notes.html#a14300"><span class="t9">{46}</span></a> to attain Nibbāna after the destruction <span class="t18">[1.13]</span> of human passion? Let me rather, like Dīpaṅkara, the One with Ten Powers, having risen to the supreme Awakening, enable mankind to enter the Ship of the Dhamma and so carry them across the Ocean of Existence, and when this is done afterwards attain Nibbāna; this indeed it is right that I should do.&rdquo; Then having enumerated the eight conditions (necessary to the attainment of Buddhahood), and having made the resolution to become Buddha, he laid himself down.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">64. &ldquo;As I lay upon the ground this was the thought of my heart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;If I wished it I might this day destroy within me all human passions.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">65. But why should I in disguise arrive at the knowledge of the Dhamma?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will attain omniscience and become a Buddha, and (save) men and Devas.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">66. Why should I cross the ocean resolute but alone?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will attain omniscience, and enable men and Devas to cross.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">67. By this resolution of mine, I, a man of resolution,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Will attain omniscience, and save men and Devas,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">68. Cutting off the stream of transmigration, annihilating the three forms of existence,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Embarking in the ship of the Dhamma, I will carry across with me men and Devas.&rdquo;</span><a id="a327"></a><a href="notes.html#a14303"><span class="t19">{47}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">[Wherefore<a id="a328"></a><a href="notes.html#a14305"><span class="t9">{48}</span></a> wishing for Buddhahood (he said):</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">69. &ldquo;Conditioned by being a human being and male, meeting a teacher,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Going-forth, being endowed with virtue, aspiration and wholesome desire,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Resolve, with these eight things combined he will succeed.&rdquo;] </span><span class="t18">{1.15}</span></p>
<p class="p6">And the blessed Dīpaṅkara having reached the spot stood close by the ascetic Sumedha&rsquo;s head. And opening his eyes possessed of the five kinds of grace as one opens a jewelled window, and beholding the ascetic Sumedha lying in the mire, thought to himself, &ldquo;This ascetic who lies here has formed the resolution to be a Buddha; will his prayer be fulfilled or not?&rdquo; And casting forward his prescient gaze into the future, and considering, he perceived that four asaṅkheyyas and a hundred thousand aeons from that time he would become a Buddha named Gotama. And standing there in the midst of the assembly he delivered this prophecy, &ldquo;Do you see this austere ascetic lying in the mire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Lord,&rdquo; they answered. <span class="t18">[1.14]</span> &ldquo;This man lies here having made the resolution to become a Buddha, his prayer will be answered; at the end of four asaṅkheyyas and a hundred thousand cycles hence he will become a Buddha named Gotama, and in that birth the city Kapilavatthu will be his residence, queen Māyā will be his mother, king Suddhodana his father, his chief disciple will be thera Upatissa, his second disciple thera Kolita, the Buddha&rsquo;s servitor will be Ānanda, his chief female disciple the nun Khemā, the second the nun Uppalavaṇṇā. When he attains to years of ripe knowledge, having retired from the world and made the great exertion, having received at the foot of a banyan tree a meal of rice milk, and partaken of it by the banks of the Nerañjarā, having ascended the throne of Awakening, he will, at the foot of an Assattha tree, attain Supreme Buddhahood.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">70. &ldquo;Dīpaṅkara, knower of all worlds, receiver of offerings,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Standing by that which pillowed my head, spoke these words:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">71. &lsquo;See ye this austere ascetic with his matted hair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a329"></a><span class="t12">Countless ages hence he will be a Buddha in this world. </span><span class="t18">{1.16}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">72. Lo, the Tathāgata departing from pleasant Kapila,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Having fought the great fight, performed all manner of austerities.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">73. Having sat at the foot of the Ajapāla tree, the Tathāgata there received milk rice,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Shall approach the Nerañjarā river.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">74. Having received the milk rice on the banks of the Nerañjarā, the Conqueror</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Shall come by a fair road prepared for him to the foot of the Bodhi tree.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">75. Then, unrivalled and glorious, reverentially saluting the throne of Awakening,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At the foot of an Assattha tree he shall attain Buddhahood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">76. The mother that bears him shall be called Māyā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His father will be Suddhodana, he himself will be Gotama.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">77. His chief disciples will be Upatissa and Kolita,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Void of human passion, freed from desire, calm-minded and tranquil.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">78. The servitor Ānanda will attend upon the Conqueror,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Khemā and Uppalavaṇṇā will be his chief female disciples,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">79. Void of human passion, freed from desire, calm-minded and tranquil.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The sacred tree of this Buddha is called the Assattha.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[1.15]</span></p>
<p class="p6">The ascetic Sumedha, exclaiming, &ldquo;My prayer, it seems, will be accomplished,&rdquo; was filled with happiness. The multitudes, hearing the words of Dīpaṅkara, the One with Ten Powers, were joyous and delighted, exclaiming, &ldquo;The ascetic Sumedha, it seems, is a Buddha seed, a tender shoot that will grow up into a Buddha.&rdquo; For thus they thought: &ldquo;As a man fording a river, if he is unable to cross to the ford opposite him, crosses to a ford lower down the stream, even so we, if in the dispensation of Dīpaṅkara, the One with Ten Powers, fail to attain the paths and their fruition, yet when you shall become Buddha we shall be enabled in thy presence to make the paths and their fruition our own,&rdquo; &ndash; and so they recorded their prayer (for future assurance).</p>
<p class="p7">The Buddha Dīpaṅkara, the One with Ten Powers, having praised the Bodhisatta, and made an offering to him of eight handfuls of flowers, reverentially saluted him and departed. And the Arahats, also, four hundred thousand in number, having made offerings to the Bodhisatta of perfumes and garlands, reverentially saluted him and departed. And the Devas and men having made the same offerings, and bowed down to him, went their way.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a330"></a>And the Bodhisatta, when all had retired, rising from his seat and exclaiming, &ldquo;I will investigate the Perfections,&rdquo; sat himself down cross-legged on a heap of flowers. And as the Bodhisatta sat thus, the Devas in all the ten thousand worlds assembling shouted applause. &ldquo;Venerable ascetic Sumedha,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;all the auguries which have manifested themselves when former Bodhisattas seated themselves cross-legged, saying, &lsquo;We will investigate the Perfections,&rsquo; &ndash; all these this day have appeared: assuredly you shall become Buddha. <span class="t18">{1.17} </span>This we know, to whom these omens appear, he surely will become a Buddha; do you make a strenuous effort and exert thyself.&rdquo; With these words they lauded the Bodhisatta with varied praises.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said, <span class="t18">[1.16]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">80. &ldquo;Hearing these words of the incomparable Sage,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Devas and men delighted, exclaimed, &lsquo;This is a seed of a Buddha.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">81. A great clamour arises, men and Devas in ten thousand worlds</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Clap their hands, and laugh, and make obeisance with clasped hands.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">82. &lsquo;Should we fail,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;in this Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet in time to come we shall stand before him.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">83. As men crossing a river, if they fail to reach the opposite ford,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gaining the lower ford cross the great river,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">84. Even so we all, if we lose this Buddha,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In time to come shall stand before him.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">85. The world-knowing Dīpaṅkara, the receiver of offerings,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Having celebrated my meritorious act, went his way.</span><a id="a331"></a><a href="notes.html#a14307"><span class="t19">{49}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">86. All the disciples of the Buddha that were present saluted me with reverence,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Men, Nāgas, and Gandhabbas bowed down to me and departed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">87. When the lord of the world with his following had passed beyond my sight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then glad, with gladsome heart, I rose up from my seat.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">88. Joyful I am with a great joy, glad with a great gladness;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Flooded with rapture then I seated myself cross-legged.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">89. And even as thus I sat I thought within myself,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;I am subject to Absorption, I have mastered the Super Knowledges.</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">110. No danger then comes near; this day this thing is seen,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">112. All noisome odours flee away, celestial fragrance breathes around,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">115. Then walls, and doors, and rocks are no impediment,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This day they have melted into air,</span><a id="a335"></a><a href="notes.html#a14313"><span class="t19">{52}</span></a><span class="t12"> &ndash; verily you will be a Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">116. At that moment death and birth do not take place,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This day these things are seen &ndash; verily you will be a Buddha.</span></p>

<p class="p6">And the Bodhisatta, having heard the words of Dīpaṅkara, the One with Ten Powers, and of the Devas in ten thousand worlds, filled with immeasurable resolution, thought thus within himself, &ldquo;The Buddhas are beings whose word cannot fail; there is no deviation from truth in their speech. For as the fall of a clod thrown into the air, as the death of a mortal, as the sunrise at dawn, as a lion&rsquo;s roaring when he leaves his lair, as the delivery of a woman with child, as these things are sure and certain &ndash; even so the word of the Buddhas is sure and cannot fail, verily I shall become a Buddha.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">118. &ldquo;Having heard the words of Buddha and of the Devas of ten thousand worlds,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Glad, joyous, delighted, I then thought thus within myself:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">119. &lsquo;The Buddhas speak not doubtful words, the Conquerors speak not vain words,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There is no falsehood in the Buddhas &ndash; verily I shall become a Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">120. As a clod cast into the air does surely fall to the ground,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So the word of the glorious Buddhas is sure and everlasting.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">121. As the death of all mortals is sure and constant,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So the word of the glorious Buddhas is sure and everlasting.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">122. As the rising of the sun is certain when night has faded,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So the word of the glorious Buddhas is sure and everlasting.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">123. As the roaring of a lion who has left his den is certain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So the word of the glorious Buddhas is sure and everlasting.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">124. As the delivery of women with child is certain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So the word of the glorious Buddhas is sure and everlasting.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a336"></a>And having thus made the resolution, &ldquo;I shall surely become Buddha,&rdquo; with a view to investigating the conditions that constitute a Buddha, exclaiming, &ldquo;Where are the conditions that make the Buddha, <span class="t18">{1.20}</span> are they found above or below, in the principal or the minor directions?&rdquo; investigating successively the principles of all things, and beholding the first Perfection of Generosity [Dāna], practised and followed by former Bodhisattas, he thus admonished his own soul, &ldquo;Wise Sumedha, from this time forth <span class="t18">[1.19]</span> you must fulfil the perfection of Generosity; for as a water-jar overturned discharges the water so that none remains, and cannot recover it, even so if you, indifferent to wealth and fame, and wife and child, and goods great and small, give away to all who come and ask everything that they require till nought remains, you will sit at the foot of the Bodhi tree and become a Buddha.&rdquo; With these words he strenuously resolved to attain the first perfection of Generosity.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">125. &ldquo;Come, I will search the Buddha-making conditions, this way and that,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Above and below, in all the ten directions, as far as the principles of things extend.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a337"></a><span class="t12">126. Then, as I made my search, I beheld the first Perfection of Generosity,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The high road followed by former sages.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">127. &lsquo;Do you strenuously taking it upon thyself advance</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To this first Perfection of Generosity, if you will attain Buddhahood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">128. As a brimming water-jar, overturned by any one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Discharges entirely all the water, and retains none within,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">129. Even so, when you see any that ask, great, small, and middling,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do you give away all in alms, as the water-jar overthrown.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a338"></a>But considering further, &ldquo;There must be beside this other conditions that make a Buddha,&rdquo; and beholding the second Perfection of Virtue [Sīla], he thought thus, &ldquo;O wise Sumedha, from this day forth may you fulfil the perfection of Virtue; for as the Yak, regardless of his life, guards his bushy tail, even so you will become a Buddha, if from this day forward regardless of your life you keep the moral precepts.&rdquo; And he strenuously resolved to attain the second perfection of Virtue.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">130. &ldquo;For the conditions of a Buddha cannot be so few,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let me investigate the other conditions that bring Buddhahood to maturity.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a339"></a><span class="t12">131. Then investigating I beheld the second Perfection of Virtue</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">132. &lsquo;This second one do you strenuously undertake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And reach the Perfection of Virtue if you would attain Buddhahood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">133. And as the Yak cow, when her tail has got entangled in anything,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then and there awaits death, and will not injure her tail,</span><a id="a340"></a><a href="notes.html#a14315"><span class="t19">{53}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{1.21}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">134. So also do you, having fulfilled the moral precepts in the four stages,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ever guard Virtue as the Yak guards her tail.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a341"></a><a id="a342"></a>But considering further, &ldquo;These cannot be the only Buddha-making conditions,&rdquo; and beholding the third Perfection of Renunciation [Nekkhamma], he thought thus, &ldquo;O wise Sumedha, may you henceforth fulfil the perfection of Renunciation; for as a man long the denizen of a prison feels no love for it, but is discontented, and wishes to live there no more, even so do you, likening all births to a prison-house, discontented with all births, and anxious to get rid of them, set thy face toward renunciation, thus will you become Buddha.&rdquo; And he strenuously made the resolution to attain the third perfection of Renunciation.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">135. &ldquo;For the conditions that make a Buddha cannot be so few,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will investigate others, the conditions that bring Buddhahood to maturity.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">136. Investigating then I beheld the third Perfection of Renunciation</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Practised and followed by former sages.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">137. &lsquo;This third one do you strenuously undertake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And reach the Perfection of Renunciation, if you would attain Buddhahood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">138. As a man long a denizen of the house of bonds, oppressed with suffering,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Feels no pleasure therein, but rather longs for release,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">139. Even so do you look upon all births as prison-houses,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Set thy face toward Renunciation, to obtain release from Existence.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But considering further, &ldquo;These cannot be the only Buddha-making conditions,&rdquo; and beholding the fourth Perfection of Wisdom [Paññā], he thought thus, &ldquo;O wise Sumedha, <span class="t18">[1.21]</span> do you from this day forth fulfil the perfection of Wisdom, avoiding no subject of knowledge, great, small, or middling,<a id="a343"></a><a href="notes.html#a14317"><span class="t9">{54}</span></a> do you approach all wise men and ask them questions; for as the mendicant on his begging rounds, avoiding none of the families, great and small, that he frequents,<a id="a344"></a><a href="notes.html#a14319"><span class="t9">{55}</span></a> and wandering for alms from place to place, speedily gets food to support him, even so will you, approaching all wise men, and asking them questions, become a Buddha.&rdquo; And he strenuously resolved to attain the fourth perfection of Wisdom.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">140. &ldquo;For the conditions that make a Buddha cannot be so few,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will investigate the other conditions that bring Buddhahood to maturity.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">141. Investigating then I beheld the fourth Perfection of Wisdom</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">142. &lsquo;This fourth do you strenuously undertake,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">143. And as a monk on his begging rounds avoids no families,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Either small, or great, or middling, and so obtains subsistence,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">144. Even so you, constantly questioning wise men,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And reaching the Perfection of Wisdom, will attain supreme Buddhahood.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a345"></a>But considering further, &ldquo;These cannot be the only Buddha-making conditions,&rdquo; and seeing the fifth Perfection of Effort [Viriya], he thought thus, &ldquo;O wise Sumedha, do you from this day forth fulfil the perfection of Exertion. As the lion, the king of beasts, in every action<a id="a346"></a><a href="notes.html#a14321"><span class="t9">{56}</span></a><a id="a347"></a> strenuously makes an effort himself, so if you in all existences and in all your acts are strenuous in effort, and not a laggard, you will become a Buddha.&rdquo; And he made a firm resolve to attain the fifth perfection of Effort.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said, <span class="t18">[1.22]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">145. &ldquo;For the conditions of a Buddha cannot be so few,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">147. &lsquo;This fifth do you strenuously undertake,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">148. As the lion, king of beasts, in lying, standing and walking,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is no laggard, but ever of resolute heart,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">149. Even so do you also in every existence strenuously exert thyself,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And reaching the Perfection of Effort, you will attain the supreme Buddhahood.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a350"></a>But considering further, &ldquo;These cannot be the only Buddha-making conditions,&rdquo; and beholding the sixth Perfection of Patience [Khanti], he thought to himself, &ldquo;O wise Sumedha, do you from this time forth fulfil the perfection of forbearance; be you patient in praise and in reproach. And as when men throw things pure or foul upon the earth, the earth does not feel either desire or repulsion towards them, but suffers them, endures them and acquiesces in them, even so you also, if you are patient in praise and reproach, will become a Buddha.&rdquo; And he strenuously resolved to attain the sixth perfection of Patience.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">150. &ldquo;For the conditions of a Buddha cannot be so few,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">152. &lsquo;Having strenuously taken up this sixth Perfection,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">170. &ldquo;For these cannot be all the conditions of a Buddha,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will seek other conditions that bring about Buddhahood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">171. Seeking then I beheld the tenth Perfection of Equanimity</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Practised and followed by former Buddhas.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a357"></a><span class="t12">172. &lsquo;If you take resolutely upon thyself this tenth Perfection,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Becoming well-balanced and firm, you will attain supreme Buddhahood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">173. And as the earth is indifferent to pure and impure things cast upon her,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To both alike, and is free from anger and favour,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">174. Even so do you ever be evenly-balanced in joy and grief,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Advancing to the Perfection of Equanimity, you will attain supreme Buddhahood.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then he thought: &ldquo;These are the only conditions in this world that, bringing Buddhahood to perfection and constituting a Buddha, have to be fulfilled by Bodhisattas; beside the Ten Perfections there are no others. And these Ten Perfections are neither in the heaven above nor in the earth below, nor are they to be found in the east or the other quarters, but reside in my heart of flesh.&rdquo; Having thus realized that the Perfections were established in his heart, having strenuously resolved to keep them all, grasping them again and again, he mastered them forwards and backwards;<a id="a358"></a><a href="notes.html#a14327"><span class="t9">{59}</span></a> taking them at the end he went backward to the beginning, taking them at the beginning he placed them at the end,<a id="a359"></a><a href="notes.html#a14329"><span class="t9">{60}</span></a> taking them at the middle he carried them to the two ends, taking them at both ends he carried them to the middle. <span class="t18">[1.26]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Repeating, &ldquo;The Perfections are the sacrifice of limbs, the Lesser Perfections are the sacrifice of property, the Unlimited Perfections are the sacrifice of life,&rdquo; he mastered them as the Perfections, the Lesser Perfections and the Unlimited Perfections &ndash; like one who converts two kindred oils into one,<a id="a360"></a><a href="notes.html#a14331"><span class="t9">{61}</span></a> or like one who, using Mount Meru for his churning-rod, churns the great Cakkavāla ocean. And as he grasped again and again the Ten Perfections, by the power of his piety this earth, four nahutas and eight hundred thousand leagues in breadth, like a bundle of reeds trodden by an elephant, or a sugar-mill in motion, uttering a mighty roar, trembled, shook and quaked, and spun round like a potter&rsquo;s wheel or the wheel of an oil-mill.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a361"></a><span class="t12">175. &ldquo;These are all the conditions in the world that bring Buddhahood to perfection:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beyond these are no others, therein do you stand fast.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">176. While he grasped these conditions natural and intrinsic,</span><a id="a362"></a><a href="notes.html#a14333"><span class="t19">{62}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By the power of his piety the earth of ten thousand worlds quaked.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">177. The earth swayed and thundered like a sugar-mill at work,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a363"></a><span class="t12">Like the wheel of an oil-mill so shakes the earth.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{1.26}</span></p>
<p class="p6">And while the earth was trembling the people of Ramma, unable to endure it, like great Sāl trees overthrown by the wind that blows at the end of a cycle, fell swooning here and there, while waterpots and other vessels, revolving like a jar on a potter&rsquo;s wheel, struck against each other and were dashed and ground to pieces. The multitudes in fear and trembling approaching the Teacher said: &ldquo;Tell us, Fortunate One, is this turmoil caused by dragons, or is it caused by either bhūtas, or Yakkhas, or by Devas? for this we know not, but truly this whole multitude is grievously afflicted. Does <span class="t18">[1.27]</span> this portend evil to the world or good? tell us the cause of it.&rdquo; The Teacher hearing their words said: &ldquo;Fear not, nor be troubled, there is no danger to you from this. The wise Sumedha, concerning whom I predicted this day, &lsquo;Hereafter he will be a Buddha named Gotama,&rsquo; is now mastering the Perfections, and while he masters them and turns them about, by the power of his piety the whole ten thousand worlds with one accord quake and thunder,&rdquo; Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">178. &ldquo;All the multitude that was there in attendance on the Buddha,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Trembling, fell swooning there upon the ground.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">179. Many thousands of waterpots and many hundred jars</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Were crushed and pounded there and dashed against each other.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">180. Excited, trembling, terrified, confused, their senses disordered,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The multitudes assembling, approached the Buddha,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">181. Say, will it be good or evil to the world?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The whole world is afflicted, ward off this (danger), Omniscient One.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">182. Then the Great Sage Dīpaṅkara enjoined upon them,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be confident, be not afraid at this earthquaking:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">183. He concerning whom I predicted this day, &lsquo;He will be a Buddha in this world,&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The same is investigating the time-honoured Conditions followed by the Buddhas.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">184. Therefore while he is investigating fully these Conditions, the groundwork of a Buddha,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The earth of ten thousand worlds is shaken in the world of men and of Devas.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And the people hearing the Tathāgata&rsquo;s words, joyful and delighted, taking with them garlands, perfumes and unguents, left the city of Ramma, and went to the Bodhisatta. And having offered their flowers and other presents, and bowing to him and respectfully saluting him, they returned to the city of Ramma. And the Bodhisatta, having made a strenuous exertion and resolve, rose from the seat on which he sat.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said, <span class="t18">{1.27}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">185. &ldquo;Having heard the Buddha&rsquo;s word, their minds were straightway calmed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All of them approaching me again paid me their homage. </span><span class="t18">[1.28]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">186. Having taken upon me the Perfections of a Buddha, having made firm my resolve,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Having bowed to Dīpaṅkara, I rose from my seat.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And as the Bodhisatta rose from his seat, the Devas in all the ten thousand worlds having assembled and offered him garlands and perfumes, uttered these and other words of praise and blessing, &ldquo;Venerable ascetic Sumedha, this day you have made a mighty resolve at the feet of Dīpaṅkara Buddha, may you fulfil it without let or hindrance: fear not nor be dismayed, may not the slightest sickness visit your frame, quickly exercise the Perfections and attain supreme Buddhahood. As the flowering and fruit-bearing trees bring forth flowers and fruit in due season, so do you also, not letting the right season pass by, quickly reach the supreme knowledge of a Buddha.&rdquo; And thus having spoken, they returned each one to his celestial home.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the Bodhisatta, having received the homage of the Devas, made a strenuous exertion and resolve, saying: &ldquo;Having fulfilled the Ten Perfections, at the end of four asaṅkheyyas and a hundred thousand cycles I shall become a Buddha.&rdquo; And rising into the air he returned to Himavanta.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore it is said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">187. &ldquo;As he rose from his seat both Devas and men</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sprinkle him with celestial and earthly flowers.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">188. Both Devas and men pronounce their blessing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A great prayer you have made, may you obtain it according to your wish.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">189. May all dangers be averted, may every sickness vanish,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May you have no hindrance &ndash; quickly reach the supreme knowledge of a Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">190. As when the season is come the flowering trees do blossom,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Even so do you, O mighty One, blossom with the wisdom of a Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">191. As all the Buddhas have fulfilled the Ten Perfections,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Even so do you, O mighty One, fulfil the Ten Perfections.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">192. As all the Buddhas are enlightened on the throne of knowledge,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Even so do you, O mighty One, receive Awakening in the wisdom of a Buddha. </span><span class="t18">[1.29]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">193. As all the Buddhas have established the supremacy of the Dhamma,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Even so do you, O mighty One, establish the supremacy of the Dhamma.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">194. As the moon on the mid-day of the month shines in her purity,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Even so do you, with thy mind at the full, shine in ten thousand worlds. </span><span class="t18">{1.28}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">195. As the sun released by Rāhu glows fervently in his heat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Even so, having redeemed mankind, do you shine in all thy majesty.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">196. As all the rivers find their way to the great ocean,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Even so may the worlds of men and Devas take refuge in thee.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">197. The Bodhisatta extolled with these praises, taking on himself the ten Conditions,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Commencing to fulfil these Conditions, entered the forest.</span></p>
<h5 class="h50"><a id="ncx1326"></a>End of the Story of Sumedha</h5>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx1327"></a><a id="a364"></a>[Buddha Dīpaṅkara]</h4>
<p class="p7">And the people of the city of Ramma, having returned to the city, kept open house to the monastics with the Buddha at their head. The Teacher having preached the Dhamma to them, and established them in the three Refuges and so on, departing from the city of Ramma, living thereafter his allotted span of life, having fulfilled all the duties of a Buddha, in due course attained Nibbāna in that element of annihilation in which no trace of existence remains. On this subject all that need be said can be learned from the narrative in the Buddhavaṁsa, for it is said in that work,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">198. &ldquo;Then they, having entertained the chief of the world with his monastics,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a365"></a><span class="t12">Took refuge in the Teacher Dīpaṅkara.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">199. Some the Tathāgata established in the refuges,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Some in the five precepts, others in the ten precepts.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">200. To some he gives the four glorious fruits of the ascetic life,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On some he bestows those peerless qualities the analytical knowledges.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">201. To some the Lord of men grants the eight sublime Attainments,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On some he bestows the three knowledges and the six Super Knowledges.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">202. In this order</span><a id="a366"></a><a href="notes.html#a14336"><span class="t19">{63}</span></a><span class="t12"> the Great Sage exhorts the multitude.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a367"></a><span class="t12">Therewith the dispensation of the world&rsquo;s Protector was spread wide abroad. </span><span class="t18">[1.30]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">203. He of the mighty jaw, of the broad shoulder, Dīpaṅkara by name,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Procured the salvation of many men, warded off from them future punishment.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">204. Beholding persons ripe for salvation, reaching them in an instant,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Even at a distance of four hundred thousand leagues, the Great Sage awakened them (to the knowledge of the truth).</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">205. At the first conversion the Buddha converted a thousand millions.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At the second the Protector converted a hundred thousand.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">206. When the Buddha preached the truth in the Deva world,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There took place a third conversion of nine hundred millions. </span><span class="t18">{1.29}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">207. The Teacher Dīpaṅkara had three assemblies,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The first was a meeting of a million millions.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">208. Again when the Conqueror went into seclusion at Nārada peak,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A thousand million spotless Arahats met together.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">209. When the Mighty One dwelt on the lofty rock Sudassana,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then the Sage surrounded himself with nine hundred thousand millions.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">210. At that time I was an ascetic wearing matted hair, a man of austere penances,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Moving through the air, accomplished in the five Super Knowledges.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">211. The (simultaneous) conversion of tens of thousands, of twenties of thousands, took place,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of ones and twos the conversions were beyond computation.</span><a id="a368"></a><a href="notes.html#a14338"><span class="t19">{64}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">212. Then did the pure dispensation of Dīpaṅkara Buddha become widely spread,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Known to many men prosperous and flourishing.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">213. Four hundred thousand saints, possessed of the six Super Knowledges, endowed with psychic powers,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ever attend upon Dīpaṅkara, knower of the three worlds.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">214. Blameworthy are all they who at that time leave the human existence,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Not having obtained final sanctity, still imperfect in knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">215. The word of Buddha shines in the world of men and Devas, made to blossom by Arahats such as these,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Freed from human passion, void of all taint (of sin).</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">216. The city of Dīpaṅkara Buddha was called Rammavatī,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The khattiya Sumedha was his father, Sumedhā his mother.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">217. Sumaṅgala and Tissa were his chief disciples,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Sāgata was the servitor of Dīpaṅkara Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">218. Nandā and Sunandā were his chief female disciples.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The Bodhi tree of this Buddha is called the Pipphali.</span><a id="a369"></a><a href="notes.html#a14340"><span class="t19">{65}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">219. Eighty cubits in height the Great Sage Dīpaṅkara</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Shone conspicuous as a Deodar pine, or as a noble Sāl tree in full bloom. </span><span class="t18">[1.31]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">220. A hundred thousand years was the age of this Great Sage,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And so long as he was living on earth he brought many men to salvation.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">221. Having made the Dhamma to flourish, having saved great multitudes of men,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Having flamed like a mass of fire, he died together with his disciples.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">222. And all these powers, this glory, these jewel-wheels on his feet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a370"></a><span class="t12">All is wholly gone &ndash; are not all existing things vanity! </span><span class="t18">{1.30}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">223. After Dīpaṅkara was the leader named Koṇḍañña,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of infinite powers, of boundless renown, immeasurable, unrivalled.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx1406"></a><a id="a371"></a>[Buddha Koṇḍañña]</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a372"></a>Next to the Dīpaṅkara Buddha, after the lapse of one asaṅkheyya, the Teacher Koṇḍañña appeared.</p>
<p class="p11">He also had three assemblies of saints,</p>
<p class="p11">at the first assembly there were a million millions,</p>
<p class="p11">at the second ten thousand millions,</p>
<p class="p11">at the third nine hundred millions.</p>
<p class="p6">At that time the Bodhisatta, having been born as a Universal Monarch named Vijitāvī, kept open house to the monastics with the Buddha at their head, in number a million of millions. The Teacher having predicted of the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;He will become a Buddha,&rdquo; preached the Dhamma. He having heard the Teacher&rsquo;s preaching gave up his kingdom and became a Buddhist monk. Having mastered the Three Baskets,<a id="a373"></a><a href="notes.html#a14342"><span class="t9">{66}</span></a> having obtained the six Super Knowledges, and having practised without failure the Absorptions, he was reborn in the Brahmā Realms.</p>
<p class="p11">The city of Koṇḍañña Buddha was Rammavatī,</p>
<p class="p11">the khattiya Sunanda was his father,</p>
<p class="p11">his mother was queen Sujātā,</p>
<p class="p11">Bhadda and Subhadda were his two chief disciples,</p>
<p class="p11">Anuruddha was his servitor,</p>
<p class="p11">Tissā and Upatissā his chief female disciples,</p>
<p class="p11">his Bodhi tree was the beautiful Sāla,</p>
<p class="p11">his body was eighty-eight cubits high,</p>
<p class="p11">and the duration of his life was a hundred thousand years.</p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx1422"></a><a id="a374"></a>[Buddha Maṅgala]</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a375"></a>After him, at the end of one asaṅkheyya, in one and the same cycle four Buddhas were born, Maṅgala, Sumana, Revata and Sobhita.</p>
<p class="p11">Maṅgala Buddha had three assemblies of saints,</p>
<p class="p11">of these at the first there were <span class="t18">[1.32]</span> a million million priests,</p>
<p class="p11">at the second ten thousand millions,</p>
<p class="p11">at the third nine hundred millions.</p>
<p class="p6">It is related that a step-brother of his, prince Ānanda, accompanied by an assembly of nine hundred millions, went to the Teacher to hear him preach the Dhamma. The Teacher gave a discourse dealing successively with his various doctrines, and Ānanda and his whole retinue attained Arahatship together with the analytical knowledges.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher looking back upon the meritorious works done by these men of family in former existences, and perceiving that they had enough merit to acquire the robe and bowl by Supernormal Powers, stretching forth his right hand exclaimed, &ldquo;Come, priests.&rdquo;<a id="a376"></a><a href="notes.html#a14344"><span class="t9">{67}</span></a> Then straightaway all of them having become equipped with obtained robes and bowls by Supernormal Powers, and perfect in decorum,<a id="a377"></a><a href="notes.html#a14346"><span class="t9">{68}</span></a> as if they were elders of sixty years standing, paid homage to the Teacher and attended upon him. This was his third assembly of saints.</p>
<p class="p7">Whereas with other Buddhas a light shone from their bodies to the distance of eighty cubits on every side, it was not so with this Buddha, but the light from his body permanently filled ten thousand worlds, and trees, earth, mountains, seas and all other things, not excepting even pots and pans and such-like articles, became as it were overspread with a film of gold. The duration of his life was ninety thousand years, and during the whole of this period the sun, moon and other heavenly bodies could not shine by their own light, and there was no distinction between night and day. By day all living beings <span class="t18">{1.31} </span>went about in the light of the Buddha as if in the light of the sun, and men ascertained the limits of night and day only by the flowers that blossomed in the evening and by the birds and other animals that uttered their cries in the morning. If I am asked, &ldquo;What, do not other Buddhas also possess this power?&rdquo; I reply, &ldquo;Certainly <span class="t18">[1.33]</span> they do,&rdquo; for they might at will fill with their lustre ten thousand worlds or more. But in accordance with a prayer made by him in a former existence, the lustre of Maṅgala Buddha permanently filled ten thousand worlds, just as the lustre of the others permanently extended to the distance of a fathom.<a id="a378"></a><a href="notes.html#a14348"><span class="t9">{69}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">The story is that when he was performing the duties of a Bodhisatta,<a id="a379"></a><a href="notes.html#a14350"><span class="t9">{70}</span></a> being in an existence corresponding to the Vessantara existence,<a id="a380"></a><a href="notes.html#a14352"><span class="t9">{71}</span></a> he dwelt with his wife and children on a mountain like the Vaṅka mountain (of the Vessantarajātaka). One day a demon named Kharadāṭhika,<a id="a381"></a><a href="notes.html#a14354"><span class="t9">{72}</span></a> hearing of the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s inclination to giving, approached him in the guise of a brahmin, and asked the Bodhisatta for his two children. The Bodhisatta, exclaiming, &ldquo;I give my children to the brahmin,&rdquo; cheerfully and joyfully gave up both the children, thereby causing the ocean-girt earth to quake.<a id="a382"></a><a href="notes.html#a14356"><span class="t9">{73}</span></a> The demon, standing by the bench at the end of the cloistered walk, while the Bodhisatta looked on, devoured the children like a bunch of roots. Not a particle of sorrow<a id="a383"></a><a href="notes.html#a14358"><span class="t9">{74}</span></a> arose in the Bodhisatta as he looked on the demon, and saw his mouth as soon as he opened it disgorging streams of blood like flames of fire, nay, a great joy and satisfaction welled within him as he thought: &ldquo;My gift was well given.&rdquo; And he put up the prayer, &ldquo;By the merit of this deed may rays of light one day issue from me in this very way.&rdquo; In consequence of this prayer of his it was that the rays emitted from his body when he became Buddha filled so vast a space.</p>
<p class="p7">There was also another deed done by him in a former existence. It is related that, when a Bodhisatta, having visited the relic shrine of a Buddha, he exclaimed, &ldquo;I <span class="t18">[1.34]</span> ought to sacrifice my life for this Buddha,&rdquo; and having wrapped round the whole of his body in the same way that torches are wrapped, and having filled with clarified butter a golden vessel with jewelled wick-holders, worth a hundred thousand pieces, he lit therein a thousand wicks, and having set fire to the whole of his body beginning with his head, he spent the whole night in circumambulating the shrine. And as he thus strove till dawn not the root of a hair of his head was even heated, &rsquo;twas as one enters the calyx of a lotus, for the Truth guards him who guards himself.</p>
<p class="p7">Therefore has the Fortunate One said,</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a384"></a><span class="t12">224. &ldquo;Dhamma verily protects him who walks according thereto,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dhamma rightly followed brings happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This blessing is then in rightly following the Dhamma,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The righteous man goes not to a state of punishment.&rdquo;</span><a id="a385"></a><a href="notes.html#a14360"><span class="t19">{75}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{1.32}</span></p>
<p class="p6">And through the merit of this work also the bodily lustre of this Buddha constantly extended through ten thousand worlds. At this time our Bodhisatta,<a id="a386"></a><a href="notes.html#a14362"><span class="t9">{76}</span></a> having been born as the brahmin Suruci, approached the Teacher with the view of inviting him to his house, and having heard his sweet discourse, said: &ldquo;Lord, take your meal with me tomorrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Brahmin, how many monks do you wish for?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay but how many monks have you in your escort?&rdquo; At that time was the Teacher&rsquo;s first assembly, and accordingly he replied, &ldquo;A million millions.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord, bring them all with you and come and take your meal at my house.&rdquo; The Teacher consented.</p>
<p class="p7">The brahmin having invited them for the next day, on his way home thought to himself, &ldquo;I am perfectly well able to supply <span class="t18">[1.35]</span> all these monks with broth and rice and clothes and such-like necessaries, but how can there be room for them to sit down?&rdquo; This thought of his caused the marble throne of the King of the Devas, three hundred and thirty-six thousand leagues away, to become warm.<a id="a387"></a><a href="notes.html#a14364"><span class="t9">{77}</span></a> Sakka exclaiming, &ldquo;Who wishes to bring me down from my abode?&rdquo; and looking down with the divine eye beheld the Bodhisatta, and said: &ldquo;The brahmin Suruci having invited the clergy with the Buddha at their head is perplexed for room to seat them, it behoves me also to go there and obtain a share of his merit.&rdquo; And having miraculously assumed the form of a carpenter, axe in hand he appeared before the Bodhisatta and said: &ldquo;Has any one got a job to be done for hire?&rdquo; The Bodhisatta seeing him said: &ldquo;What sort of work can you do?&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no art that I do not know; any house or hall that anybody orders me to build, I&rsquo;ll build it for him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ve got a job to be done.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve invited a million million priests for tomorrow, will you build a hall to seat them all?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll build one with pleasure if you&rsquo;ve the means of paying me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have, my good man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll build it.&rdquo; And he went and began looking out for a site.</p>
<p class="p7">There was a spot some fifty leagues in extent<a id="a388"></a><a href="notes.html#a14366"><span class="t9">{78}</span></a> as level as a Meditation Object circle.<a id="a389"></a><a href="notes.html#a14368"><span class="t9">{79}</span></a> Sakka fixed his eyes upon it, while he thought to himself, &ldquo;Let a hall made of the seven precious stones rise up over such and such an extent of ground.&rdquo; Immediately the edifice bursting through the ground rose up. The golden pillars of this hall had silver capitals,<a id="a390"></a><a href="notes.html#a14370"><span class="t9">{80}</span></a> the silver pillars had golden capitals, the gem pillars had coral capitals, the coral pillars had gem capitals, while those pillars which were made of all the <span class="t18">[1.36]</span> seven precious stones had capitals of the same. Next he said: &ldquo;Let the hall have hanging wreaths of little bells at intervals,&rdquo; and looked again. The instant he looked a fringe of bells hung down, whose musical tinkling, as they were stirred by a gentle breeze, was like a symphony of the five sorts of instruments, or as when the heavenly choirs are going on. He thought: &ldquo;Let there be hanging garlands of perfumes and flowers,&rdquo; and there the garlands hung. He thought: &ldquo;Let seats and benches for a million million <span class="t18">{1.33}</span> monks rise up through the earth,&rdquo; and straightaway they appeared. He thought: &ldquo;Let water vessels rise up at each corner of the building,&rdquo; and the water vessels arose. Having by his effected all this, he went to the brahmin and said: &ldquo;Come, sir, look at your hall, and pay me my wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta went and looked at the hall, and as he looked his whole frame was thrilled in every part with fivefold joy. And as he gazed on the hall he thought thus within himself, &ldquo;This hall was not wrought by mortal hands, but surely through my good intention, my good action, the palace of Sakka became hot, and hence this hall must have been built by the King of the Devas Sakka; it is not right that in such a hall as this I should give alms for a single day, I will give alms for a whole week.&rdquo; For the gift of external goods, however great, cannot give satisfaction to the Bodhisattas, but the Bodhisattas feel joy at their self-renunciation when they sever the crowned head, put out the henna-anointed eyes, cut out the heart and give it away.</p>
<p class="p7">For when our Bodhisatta in the Sivijātaka [Ja 499] gave alms in the middle of his capital, at the four gates of the city, at a daily expenditure of five bushels of gold coins, this liberality failed to arouse within him a feeling of satisfaction at his renunciation. But on the other hand, when the King of the Devas Sakka came to him in the disguise of a brahmin, and asked for his eyes, then indeed, as he took them out and gave them away, laughter rose within him, <span class="t18">[1.37]</span> nor did his heart swerve a hair&rsquo;s breadth from its purpose. And hence we see that as regards generosity the Bodhisattas can have no satiety.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a391"></a>Therefore this Bodhisatta also thinking: &ldquo;I ought to give alms for seven days to a million million priests,&rdquo; seated them in that hall, and for a week gave them the alms called gavapāna.<a id="a392"></a><a href="notes.html#a14373"><span class="t9">{81}</span></a> Men alone were not able to wait upon them, but the Devas themselves, taking turns with men, waited upon them. A space of fifty leagues or more sufficed not to contain the monks, yet they seated themselves each by his own power. On the last day, having caused the bowls of all the monks to be washed, and filled them with butter clarified and unclarified, honey and molasses, for medicinal use, he gave them back to them, together with the three robes. The robes and cloaks received by novices and ordained priests were worth a hundred thousand.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, when he returned thanks, considering, &ldquo;This man has given such great alms, who can he be?&rdquo; and perceiving that at the end of two asaṅkheyyas and four thousand cycles he would become a Buddha named Gotama, addressing the Bodhisatta, made this prediction, &ldquo;After the lapse of such and such a period you will become a Buddha named Gotama.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta, hearing the prediction, thought, <span class="t18">{1.34}</span> &ldquo;It seems that I am to become a Buddha, what good can a householder&rsquo;s life do me? I will give up the world,&rdquo; and, treating all this prosperity like so much drivel, he received ordination at the hands of the Teacher. And having embraced the ascetic life and learned the word of Buddha, and having attained the Super Knowledges and the Attainments, at the end of his life he was reborn in the Brahmā Realms.</p>
<p class="p11">The city of Maṅgala Buddha was called Uttara,</p>
<p class="p11">his father was the khattiya Uttara;</p>
<p class="p11">his mother was Uttarā,</p>
<p class="p11">Sudeva and Dhammasena were his two chief <span class="t18">[1.38]</span> disciples,</p>

<p class="p11">The Nāga was his Bodhi tree,</p>
<p class="p11">his body was eighty-eight cubits high.</p>
<p class="p20">When his death took place, after he had lived ninety thousand years, at the same instant ten thousand worlds were involved in darkness, and in all worlds there was a great cry and lamentation of men.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">225. &ldquo;After Koṇḍañña the leader named Maṅgala,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dispelling darkness in the world, held aloft the torch of truth.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a394"></a>And after the Buddha had died, shrouding in darkness ten thousand worlds, the Teacher named Sumana appeared.</p>

<p class="p11">at the second, on the Golden Mountain, ninety million of millions,</p>
<p class="p11">at the third eighty million of millions.</p>
<p class="p6">At this time the Bodhisatta was the Nāga king Atula, mighty and powerful. And he, hearing that a Buddha had appeared, left the Nāga world, accompanied by his assembled kinsmen, and, making offerings with celestial music to the Buddha, whose retinue was a million million of monastics, and having given great gifts, bestowing upon each two garments of fine cloth, he was established in the Three Refuges. And this Teacher also foretold of him, &ldquo;One day he will be a Buddha.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p11">so also at the third.</p>
<p class="p6">At that time the Bodhisatta having been born as the brahmin Atideva, having heard the Teacher&rsquo;s preaching, was established in the Three Refuges. And raising his clasped hands to his head, having praised the Teacher&rsquo;s abandonment of human passion, presented him with a monk&rsquo;s upper robe. And he also made the prediction, &ldquo;You will become a Buddha.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p11">Now the city of this Buddha was called Sudhaññavatī,</p>

<p class="p6">At that time the Bodhisatta was a Yakkha chief, mighty and powerful, the lord of many millions of <span class="t18">{1.36}</span><a id="a402"></a> millions of Yakkhas. He, hearing that a Buddha had appeared, came and gave a great donation to the monastic Saṅgha, with the Buddha at their head.

For seven days he laid not aside the bliss arising from the thought of the Buddha, but through joy and gladness, seeking not after prey, he kept in attendance there, offering up his life. When the Teacher, after seven days, aroused himself from his trance, he looked upon the lion and thought: &ldquo;He will put trust in the monastic Saṅgha and make obeisance to them; let them draw near.&rdquo; At that very moment the monks drew near, and the lion put faith in the Saṅgha.

<p class="p6">At that time the Bodhisatta was a Universal Monarch; and hearing that a Buddha was born he went to him and heard the Dhamma, and gave to the Saṅgha, with the Buddha at their head, his kingdom of the four continents with its seven treasures, and took the vows under the Teacher. All the dwellers in the land, taking advantage of the birth of a Buddha in their midst, did duty as servants in the monasteries, and continually gave great donations to the Saṅgha, with the Buddha at their head.
