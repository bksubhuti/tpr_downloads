<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Devadatta makes himself out a Buddha, but loses all his disciples in a stroke. The Buddha tells a story about a crow who tried to imitate a cormorant, and died when he dived underwater.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (the hero crow) Vīrika,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;O have you seen.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.103]</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about imitating the Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4562"></a><span class="t30">When the elders had gone with their followers to visit Devadatta,</span><a id="a4563"></a><a href="notes.html#a15135"><span class="t9">{435}</span></a><span class="t30"> the Teacher asked Sāriputta what Devadatta had done when he saw them. The reply was that he had imitated the Buddha.</span><a id="a4564"></a><a href="notes.html#a15137"><span class="t9">{436}</span></a><span class="t30"> The Teacher rejoined, &ldquo;Not only now has Devadatta imitated me and thereby come to ruin; he did just the same before.&rdquo; Then, at the elder&rsquo;s request, he told a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{2.149}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4565"></a>In the past, while Brahmadatta reigned as king in Benares, the Bodhisatta became a cormorant, and dwelt by a certain pool. His name was Vīraka, the Hero.</p>
<p class="p7">There arose a famine in Kāsi. Men could not spare food for the crows, nor make offerings to Yakkhas and Nāgas. One by one the crows left the famine-stricken land, and betook them to the woods.</p>
<p class="p7">A certain crow named Saviṭṭhaka, who lived at Benares, took with him his lady crow and went to the place where Vīraka lived, making his abode beside the same pool.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, this crow was seeking food about the pool. He saw how Vīraka went down into it, and made a meal off some fish; and afterwards came up out of the water again, and stood drying his feathers. &ldquo;Under the wing of that crow,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;plenty of fish are to be got. I will become his servant.&rdquo; So he drew near.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What is it, sir?&rdquo; asked Vīraka. &ldquo;I want to be your servant, my lord!&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p class="p7">Vīraka agreed, and from that time the other served him. And from that time, Vīraka used to eat enough fish to keep him alive, and the rest he gave to Saviṭṭhaka as soon as he had caught them; and when Saviṭṭhaka had eaten enough to keep him alive, he gave what was over to his wife.</p>
<p class="p7">After a while pride came into his heart. &ldquo;This crow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is black, and so am I: in eyes and beak and feet, too, there is no difference between us. I don&rsquo;t want his fish; I will catch my own!&rdquo; So he told Vīraka that for the future he intended to go down to the water and catch fish himself. Then Vīraka said: &ldquo;Good friend, you do not belong to a <span class="t18">[2.104] </span>tribe of such crows as are born to go into water and catch fish. Don&rsquo;t destroy yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4566"></a>But in spite of this attempt to dissuade him, Saviṭṭhaka did not take the warning to heart. Down he went to the pool, down into the water; but he could not make his way through the weeds and come out again &ndash; there he was, entangled in the weeds, with only the tip of his beak appearing above the water. So not being able to breathe he perished there beneath the water. <span class="t18">{2.150}</span></p>
<p class="p7">His mate noticed that he did not return, and went to Vīraka to ask news of him. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;Saviṭṭhaka is not to be seen, where is he?&rdquo; And as she asked him this, she repeated the first verse:<a id="a4567"></a><a href="notes.html#a15140"><span class="t9">{437}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4568"></a><a id="a4569"></a><span class="t12">1. Api Vīraka passesi sakuṇaṁ mañjubhāṇakaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a4574"></a><a id="a4575"></a><a id="a4576"></a><span class="t4">Have you seen, O Vīraka, the bird having a very sweet voice, with a neck looking like a peacock&rsquo;s, my husband Saviṭṭhaka?</span></p>
<p class="p23">When Vīraka heard it, he replied, &ldquo;Yes, I know where he is gone,&rdquo; and recited the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4577"></a><a id="a4578"></a><a id="a4579"></a><span class="t12">2. Udakathalacarassa pakkhino,</span></p>

<p class="p23">When the lady-crow heard it, weeping, she returned to Benares.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Devadatta was then incarnate as Saviṭṭhaka, and I myself was Vīraka.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present two young monks are unsure which one of them is the most handsome, so they ask an old monk, who declares he is more handsome than they are. The Buddha tells a story of two fish who similarly asked a turtle to decide which of them was more handsome, only for him to declare that he was the most handsome of all!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Fine are the fish.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {2.151}</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about two young monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4590"></a><a id="a4591"></a><span class="t30">These two young fellows, we are told, belonged to a good family of Sāvatthi, and had embraced the dispensation. But they, not realising the impurity of the body,</span><a id="a4592"></a><a href="notes.html#a15143"><span class="t9">{438}</span></a><span class="t30"> sang the praises of their beauty, and went about bragging of it. </span><span class="t18">[2.105]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4593"></a><span class="t30">One day they fell into a dispute on this point, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re handsome, but so am I,&rdquo; said each of them; then, spying an aged elder sitting not far away, they agreed that he was likely to know whether they were handsome or not. Then they approached him with the question, &ldquo;Sir, which of us is handsome?&rdquo; The elder replied, &ldquo;Friends, I am more handsome than either of you.&rdquo; At this the young men reviled him, and went off, grumbling that he told them something they did not ask, but would not tell them what they did.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Saṅgha became aware of this event; and one day, when they were all together in the Dhamma Hall, they began talking about it. &ldquo;Friend, how the old elder shamed those two young fellows whose heads were full of their own beauty!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking of now as they sat together. They told him. He rejoined: &ldquo;This, is not the only time, monks, that our friends were full of the praises of their own beauty. In olden times they used to go about boasting of it as they do now.&rdquo; And then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, during the reign of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, the Bodhisatta became a Tree Devatā on the bank of the Ganges. At the point where Ganges and Jumna meet, two fish met together, one from the Ganges and one from the Jumna. &ldquo;I am beautiful!&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;and so are you!&rdquo; and then they fell to quarrelling about their beauty. Not far from the Ganges they saw a turtle lying on the bank. &ldquo;That fellow shall decide whether or no we are beautiful!&rdquo; said they; and they went up to him. &ldquo;Which of us is beautiful, friend turtle,&rdquo; they asked, &ldquo;the Ganges fish or the Jumna fish? &ldquo;The turtle answered, &ldquo;The Ganges fish is beautiful, and the Jumna fish is beautiful: but I am more beautiful than you both.&rdquo; And to explain it, he uttered the first verse: <span class="t18">{2.152}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4594"></a><span class="t12">1. Sobhati maccho Gaṅgeyyo, atho sobhati Yāmuno,</span></p>

<p class="p23">When the fish heard this, they cried, &ldquo;Ah, you rascally turtle! You won&rsquo;t answer our question, but you answer another one!&rdquo; and they repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4607"></a><a id="a4608"></a><a id="a4609"></a><span class="t12">2. Yaṁ pucchito na taṁ akkhāsi, aññaṁ akkhāsi pucchito,</span></p>

<p class="p23"><span class="t30">When this discourse was concluded, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;In those days the young monks were the two fish, the old man was the turtle, and I was the Tree Devatā who saw the whole thing from the Ganges bank.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Devadatta is going around trying to kill the Buddha. The latter tells a story of how he had done a similar thing in the past, when the Bodhisatta was an antelope, and Devadatta a hunter, and how he had been thwarted by his friends, the woodpecker and the tortoise.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the antelope (kuruṅgamiga),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Come, turtle.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.106]</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Veḷuvana, about Devadatta. News came to the Teacher that Devadatta was plotting his death. &ldquo;Ah, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it was just the same long ago; Devadatta tried then to kill me, as he is trying now.&rdquo; And he told them this story. </span><span class="t18">{2.153}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta became an Antelope, and lived within a forest, in a thicket near a certain lake. Not far from the same lake, sat a woodpecker perched at the top of a tree; and in the lake dwelt a turtle. And the three became friends, and lived together in amity.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4622"></a>A hunter, wandering about in the wood, observed the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s footprint at the going down into the water; and he set a trap of leather, strong, like an iron chain, and went his way. In the first watch of the night the Bodhisatta went down to drink, and got caught in the noose: whereat he cried the cry of capture. Thereupon the woodpecker flew down from her tree-top, and the turtle came out of the water, and consulted what was to be done.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4623"></a>Said the woodpecker to the turtle, &ldquo;Friend, you have teeth &ndash; bite this snare through; I will go and see to it that the hunter keeps away; and if we both do our best, our friend will not lose his life.&rdquo; To make this clear he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4624"></a><a id="a4625"></a><a id="a4626"></a><a id="a4627"></a><a id="a4628"></a><span class="t12">1. Iṅgha vaddham-ayaṁ pāsaṁ, chinda dantehi kacchapa,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4629"></a><a id="a4630"></a><a id="a4631"></a><a id="a4632"></a><span class="t12">Ahaṁ tathā karissāmi, yathā nehiti luddako ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Come on, this strap, this snare, you must cut through it with your teeth, tortoise, I will do my part likewise, because of that the hunter won&rsquo;t come.</span></p>
<p class="p23">The turtle began to gnaw the leather thong; the woodpecker made his way to the hunter&rsquo;s dwelling. At dawn of day the hunter went out, knife in hand. As soon as the bird saw him start, he uttered a cry, flapped his wings, and struck him in the face as he left the front door. &ldquo;Some bird of ill omen has struck me!&rdquo; thought the hunter; he turned back, and lay down for a little while. Then he rose up again, and took his knife. The bird reasoned within himself, &ldquo;The first time he went out by the front door, so now he will leave by the back!&rdquo; and he sat down behind the house. <span class="t18">{2.154}</span> The hunter, too, reasoned in the same way, &ldquo;When I went out by the front door, I saw a bad omen, now will I <span class="t18">[2.107] </span>go out by the back door!&rdquo; and so he did. But the bird cried out again, and struck him in the face. Finding that he was again struck by a bird of ill omen, the hunter exclaimed, &ldquo;This creature will not let me go!&rdquo; and turning back he lay down until sunrise, and when the sun was risen, he took his knife and started.</p>
<p class="p7">The woodpecker made all haste back to his friends. &ldquo;Here comes the hunter!&rdquo; he cried. By this time the turtle had gnawed through all the thongs but one tough thong: his teeth seemed as though they would fall out, and his mouth was all smeared with blood. The Bodhisatta saw the young hunter coming on like lightning, knife in hand: he burst the thong, and fled into the woods. The woodpecker perched upon his tree-top. But the turtle was so weak, that he lay where he was. The hunter threw him into a bag, and tied it to a tree.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta observed that the turtle was taken, and determined to save his friend&rsquo;s life. So he let the hunter see him, and made as though he were weak. The hunter saw him, and thinking him to be weak, seized his knife and set out in pursuit. The Bodhisatta, keeping just out of his reach, led him into the forest; and when he saw that they had come far away, gave him the slip and returned swift as the wind by another way. He lifted the bag with his horns, threw it upon the ground, ripped it open and let the turtle out. And the woodpecker came down from the tree.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the Bodhisatta thus addressed them both, &ldquo;My life has been saved by you, and you have done a friend&rsquo;s part to me. Now the hunter will come and take you; so do you, friend woodpecker, migrate elsewhere with your brood, and you, friend turtle, dive into the water.&rdquo; They did so.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, after Fully Awakening, uttered the second verse: <span class="t18">{2.155}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4633"></a><span class="t12">2. Kacchapo pāvisī vāriṁ, kuruṅgo pāvisī vanaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a4637"></a><a id="a4638"></a><span class="t4">The tortoise re-entered the lake, and the deer re-entered the woods, the woodpecker from the tree top carried his children far away.</span></p>
<p class="p23">The hunter returned, and saw none of them. He found his bag torn; picked it up, and went home sorrowful. And the three friends lived all their life long in unbroken amity, and then passed away to fare according to their deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Devadatta was the huntsman, Sāriputta the woodpecker, Moggallāna the turtle, and I was the Antelope.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is growing dissatisfied owing to his attachment to his former wife. The Buddha tells a story of how the monk was once a king who grieved when his queen passed away. The Bodhisatta cured him of his grief when he showed him she was now reborn as a dung-beetle, and did not care for him any more.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Once with the great king Assaka.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.108]</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying in Jetavana, about someone who was distracted by the recollection of a former wife. He asked the monk whether he were really lovesick. The man said, Yes. &ldquo;Whom are you in love with?&rdquo; the Teacher continued. &ldquo;My late wife,&rdquo; was the reply. Then the Teacher said: &ldquo;Not this once only, monk, have you been full of desire for this woman; in olden days her love brought you to great misery.&rdquo; And he told a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4646"></a>In the past, there was a king Assaka reigning in Potali, which is a city of the kingdom of Kāsi. His queen consort, named Ubbarī, was very dear to him; she was charming, and graceful, and beautiful, passing the beauty of women, though not so fair as a goddess. She died, and at her death the king was plunged in grief, and became sad and miserable. He had her body laid in a coffin, and embalmed with oil and ointment, and laid beneath the bed; and there he lay without food, weeping and wailing. <span class="t18">{2.156}</span> In vain did his parents and kinsfolk, friends and courtiers, monks and laymen, bid him not to grieve, since all things pass away; they could not move him. As he lay in sorrow, seven days passed by.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the Bodhisatta was at that time an ascetic, who had gained the five Super Knowledges and eight Attainments; he dwelt at the foot of the Himālayas. He was possessed of the divine eye, and as he looked round Jambudīpa with his heavenly vision, he saw this king lamenting, and straightaway resolved to help him. By his Supernormal Powers he rose in the air, and alighted in the king&rsquo;s park, and sat down on the ceremonial stone, like a golden image.</p>
<p class="p7">A young brahmin of the city of Potali entered the park, and seeing the Bodhisatta, he greeted him and sat down. The Bodhisatta began to talk pleasantly with him. &ldquo;Is the king a just ruler?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yes, sir, the king is just.&rdquo; replied the youth, &ldquo;but his queen is just dead; he has laid her body in a coffin, and lies down lamenting her; and today is the seventh day since he began. Why do you not free the king from this great grief? Virtuous beings like you ought to overcome the king&rsquo;s sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I do not know the king, young man,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;but if he were to come and ask me, I would tell him the place where she has now come into the flesh again, and make her speak herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Then, venerable sir, stay here until I bring the king to you,&rdquo; said the <span class="t18">[2.109] </span>youth. The Bodhisatta agreed, and he hastened into the king&rsquo;s presence, and told him about it. &ldquo;You should visit this being with the divine eye!&rdquo; he told the king.</p>
<p class="p7">The king was overjoyed, at the thought of seeing Ubbarī; and he entered his chariot and drove to the place. Greeting the Bodhisatta, he sat down on one side, and asked, &ldquo;Is it true, as I am told, that you know where my queen has come into being again?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yes, I do, my lord king,&rdquo; replied he. Then the king asked where it was.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta replied, &ldquo;O king, she was intoxicated with her beauty, and so fell into negligence and did not do fair and virtuous acts; so now she has become a little dung-worm in this very park.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.157}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Then I will show her to you, and make her speak,&rdquo; answered the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;Please make her speak!&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta commanded, &ldquo;Let the two that are busy rolling a lump of cow-dung, come forth before the king!&rdquo; and by his power he made them do it, and they came. The Bodhisatta pointed one out to the king, &ldquo;There is your queen Ubbarī, O king! She has just come out of this lump, following her husband the dung-worm. Look and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What! My queen Ubbarī a dung-worm? I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;I will make her speak, O king!&rdquo; &ldquo;Pray make her speak, venerable sir!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta by his power gave her speech. &ldquo;Ubbarī!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What is it, venerable sir?&rdquo; she asked, in a human voice. &ldquo;What was your name in your former character?&rdquo; the Bodhisatta asked her. &ldquo;My name was Ubbarī, sir,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;the consort of king Assaka.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p7">In the past, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life at the foot of the Himālayas as a monkey. He grew strong and sturdy, big of frame, well-to-do, and lived by a curve of the river Ganges in a forest haunt.</p>
<p class="p7">Now at that time there was a crocodile dwelling in the Ganges. The crocodile&rsquo;s mate saw the great frame of the monkey, <span class="t18">{2.159}</span> and she conceived a longing for his heart to eat. So she said to her lord, &ldquo;Sir, I desire to eat the heart of that great king of the monkeys!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Good wife,&rdquo; said the crocodile, &ldquo;I live in the water and he lives on dry land: how can we catch him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;By hook or by crook,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;caught he must be. If I don&rsquo;t get him, I shall die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered the crocodile, consoling her, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t trouble yourself. I have a plan; I will give you his heart to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4681"></a>So when the Bodhisatta was sitting on the bank of the Ganges, after taking a drink of water, the crocodile drew near, and said: &ldquo;Sir monkey, why do you live on bad fruits in this old familiar place? On the other side of the Ganges there is no end to the mango trees, and labuja trees,<a id="a4682"></a><a href="notes.html#a15152"><span class="t9">{442}</span></a> with fruit sweet as honey! Is it not better to cross over and have all kinds of wild fruit to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Lord crocodile,&rdquo; the monkey made answer, &ldquo;deep and wide is the Ganges: how shall I get across?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;If you will go, I will mount you on my back, and carry you over.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The monkey trusted him, and agreed. &ldquo;Come here, then,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;up on my back with you!&rdquo; Up the monkey climbed. But when the crocodile had swum a little way, he plunged the monkey under the water.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Good friend, you are letting me sink!&rdquo; cried the monkey. &ldquo;What is that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Said the crocodile, &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m carrying you out of pure good nature? Not a bit of it! My wife has a longing for your heart, and I want to give it her to eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said the monkey, &ldquo;it is nice of you to tell me. Why, if our heart were inside us when we go jumping among the tree-tops, it would be all knocked to pieces!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, where do you keep it?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta pointed out a fig tree, with clusters of ripe fruit, <span class="t18">[2.112] </span>standing not far off. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there are our hearts hanging on that fig tree.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.160}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;If you will show me your heart,&rdquo; said the crocodile, &ldquo;then I won&rsquo;t kill you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take me to the tree, then, and I will point it out to you hanging upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The crocodile brought him to the place. The monkey leapt off his back, and climbing up the fig tree sat upon it. &ldquo;O silly crocodile!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you thought that there were creatures that kept their hearts in a tree-top! You are a fool, and I have outwitted you! You may keep your fruit to yourself. Your body is great, but you have no intelligence.&rdquo; And then to explain this idea he uttered the following verses:</p>

<p class="p23">The crocodile, feeling as sad and miserable as if he had lost a thousand pieces of money, went back sorrowing to the place where he lived.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;In those days Devadatta was the crocodile, the lady Ciñcā was his mate, and I was the monkey.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This fellow, as we learn, </span><span class="t18">{2.161}</span><span class="t30"> was clever at taking care of his person.

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Saṅgha learned how much care he took of himself. In the Dhamma Hall, they all discussed it. &ldquo;Friend, what a clever fellow monk So-and-so is in knowing what is good for him!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking of as they sat there together.

<p class="p7">In the past, in the reign of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, the Bodhisatta became a Tree Devatā in a forest glade. A certain fowler, with a decoy bird, hair noose, and stick, went into the forest in search of birds. He began to follow one old bird which flew off into the woods, trying to escape. The bird would not give him a chance of catching it in his snare, but kept rising and alighting, rising and alighting. So the fowler covered himself with twigs and branches, and set his noose and stick again and again. But the bird, wishing to make him ashamed of himself, sent forth a human voice and repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4708"></a><a id="a4709"></a><a id="a4710"></a><a id="a4711"></a><span class="t12">1. Diṭṭhā mayā vane rukkhā, assakaṇṇā vibhīṭakā,</span></p>

<p class="p23">So saying, the bird flew off and went elsewhere. When it had gone, the fowler repeated the second verse: <span class="t18">{2.162}</span></p>

<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta entered into life as a woodpecker. In a wood of acacia trees he lived, and his name was Khadiravaniya, the bird of the acacia wood. He had a comrade named Kandagalaka, who got his food in a wood full of good fruit.</p>
<p class="p7">One day the friend went to visit Khadiravaniya. &ldquo;My friend is come!&rdquo; thought Khadiravaniya; and he led him into the acacia wood, and pecked at the tree-trunks until the insects came out, which he gave to his friend. As each was given him, the friend pecked it up, and ate it, as if it were a honey cake. As he ate, pride arose in his heart. <span class="t18">{2.163}</span> &ldquo;This bird is a woodpecker,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and so am I. What need for me to be fed by him? I will get nay own food in this acacia wood!&rdquo; So he said to Khadiravaniya,</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4736"></a>&ldquo;Friend, don&rsquo;t trouble yourself &ndash; I will get my own food in the acacia wood.&rdquo; Then said the other, &ldquo;You belong to a tribe of birds which finds its food in a forest of pithless silk-cotton trees, and trees that bear abundant fruit; but the acacia is full of pith, and hard. Please do not do so!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4737"></a>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Kandagalaka &ndash; am I not a woodpecker?&rdquo; And he would not listen, but pecked at an acacia trunk. In a moment his beak snapped off, and his eyes bade fair to fall out of his head, and his head split. So not being able to hold fast to the tree, he fell to the ground, repeating the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4738"></a><a id="a4739"></a><span class="t12">1. Ambho ko nāma yaṁ rukkho, sinnapatto sakaṇṭako,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This man, we learn, was unable to get out a single sound in the presence of two or three people. He was so very nervous, that he said one thing when he meant another.</span></p>

They told him. He answered, &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time that Lāḷudāyī has been a very nervous man. It was just the same before.&rdquo; And he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a certain brahmin family in the kingdom of Kāsi. When he came of age, he went to study at Taxila. On returning he found his family poor; and he bade his parents farewell and set out to Benares, saying to himself, &ldquo;I will set up my fallen family again!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">At Benares he became the king&rsquo;s attendant; and he grew very dear to the king and became a favourite.</p>
<p class="p7">Now his father lived by ploughing the land, but he had only one pair of oxen; and one of them died. He came before the Bodhisatta, and said to him, &ldquo;Son, one of my oxen is dead, and the ploughing does not go on. Ask the king to give you one ox!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;No, Father,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I have but just now seen the king; I ought not to ask him for oxen now: you ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;you do not know how bashful I am. If there are two or three people present I cannot get a word out. If I go to ask the king for an ox, I shall end by giving him this one!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;what must be, must be. I cannot ask the king; but I will train you to do it.&rdquo; So he led his father to a cemetery where there were clumps of sweet grass; and tying up tufts of it, he scattered them here and there, and named them one by one, pointing them out to his father, &ldquo;That is the king, that is the viceroy, this is the chief captain. Now, Father, when you come before the king, you must first say &ndash; &lsquo;Long live the king!&rsquo; and then repeat this verse, to ask for an ox,&rdquo; and this is the verse he taught him:</p>

<p class="p6">For the space of a whole year the man learned this couplet; and then he said to his son, &ldquo;Dear Somadatta, I have learned the lines! Now I can say it before any man! Take me to the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So the Bodhisatta, taking a suitable present, led his father into the king&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Long live the king!&rdquo; cried the brahmin, offering his present.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Who is this brahmin, Somadatta?&rdquo; the king asked.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Great king, it is my father,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why has he come here?&rdquo; asked the king. Then the brahmin repeated his couplet, to ask for the ox:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ldquo;I had two oxen to my plough, with which my work was done,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But one is dead! O mighty prince, please take the other one!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king saw that there was some mistake. &ldquo;Somadatta,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;you have plenty of oxen at home, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;If so, great king, they are your gift!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">At this answer the king was pleased. He gave the man, for a brahmin&rsquo;s offering, sixteen oxen, with fine caparison, and a village to live in, and sent him away with great honour. The brahmin ascended a carriage drawn by Sindh horses, pure white, and went to his dwelling in great pomp.</p>
<p class="p7">As the Bodhisatta sat beside his father in the chariot, said he, &ldquo;Father, I taught you the whole year long, and yet when the moment came you gave your ox to the king!&rdquo; and he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4785"></a><a id="a4786"></a><a id="a4787"></a><span class="t12">1. Akāsi yoggaṁ dhuvam-appamatto,</span></p>

<p class="p23">When he heard this, the brahmin uttered the second verse:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Hot at top.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.117]</span><span class="t30"> This is a story told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about one who hankered after a lost wife. The monk in question was asked by the Teacher if he really was lovesick. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so he was.&rdquo; &ldquo;For whom?&rdquo; was the next question. &ldquo;For my late wife.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monk,&rdquo; the Teacher said, &ldquo;this same woman in former days was wicked, and made you eat the leavings of her lover.&rdquo; Then he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, while Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as one of a family of poor acrobats, that lived by begging. So when he grew up, he was needy and squalid, and by begging he lived.</p>
<p class="p7">There was at the time, in a certain village of Kāsi, a brahmin whose wife was bad and wicked, and did wrong. <span class="t18">{2.168}</span> And it befell that the husband went abroad one day upon some matter, and her lover watching his time went to visit the house. After she had received him, he said: &ldquo;I will eat a bit before I go.&rdquo; So she made ready the food, and served up rice hot with sauce and curry, and gave it him, bidding him eat; she herself stood at the door, watching for the brahmin&rsquo;s coming. And while the lover was eating, the Bodhisatta stood waiting for a morsel.</p>
<p class="p7">At that moment the brahmin set his face for home. And his wife saw him drawing nigh, and ran in quickly, &ldquo;Up, my man is coming!&rdquo; and she made her lover go down into the store-room. The husband came in; she gave him a seat, and water for washing the hands; and upon the cold rice that was left by the other she turned out some hot rice, and set it before him. He put his hand into the rice, and felt that it was hot above and cold below. &ldquo;This must be someone else&rsquo;s leavings,&rdquo; thought he; and so he asked the woman about it in the words of the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4820"></a><span class="t12">1. Añño uparimo vaṇṇo, añño vaṇṇo ca heṭṭhimo,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4821"></a><a id="a4822"></a><span class="t12">Brāhmaṇī tveva pucchāmi: kiṁ heṭṭhā, kiñ-ca upparī ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4823"></a><a id="a4824"></a><a id="a4825"></a><span class="t4">The appearance on top differs, the appearance below differs, brahminī I ask you: why is below cold, why is on top hot?</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a4826"></a>Again and again he asked, but she, fearing lest her deed should be discovered, held her peace. Then a thought came into our gymnast&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;The man down in the store-room must be a lover, and this is the master of the house; the wife says nothing, for fear that her deed be made manifest. So ho! I will declare the whole matter, and show the brahmin that a man is hidden in his larder!&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.169}</span> And he told him the whole <span class="t18">[2.118] </span>matter; how that when he had gone out from his house, another had come in, and had done wrong; how he had eaten the first rice, and the wife had stood by the door to watch the road; and how the other man had been hidden in the store-room. And in so saying, he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4827"></a><a id="a4828"></a><a id="a4829"></a><span class="t12">2. Ahaṁ naṭosmi bhaddante, bhikkhakosmi idhāgato,</span></p>

<p class="p23">By his top-knot he haled the man out of the store-room, and bade him take care not to do the like again; and then he went away. The brahmin rebuked and beat them both, and gave them such a lesson that they were not likely to do the same again. Afterwards he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4839"></a><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended his discourse, he declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the lovesick monk reached the Fruit of the First Path, &ldquo;Your late wife was then the brahmin&rsquo;s lady; you, the lovesick monk, were the brahmin himself; and I was the gymnast.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the heterodox sects are losing out because of the popularity of the Buddha and the Saṅgha, and decide to bribe the king so they can build a monastery alongside the Jetavana. The Buddha tells the king a story of how two groups of ascetics were turned against each other and tried bribing the king for his favour, before realising their mistake and leaving for more remote dwellings.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the elder seer (jeṭṭhaka-isi).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a4845"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Heretics, Jealousy.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;The king of Bharu.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying at Jetavana, about the king of Kosala.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4846"></a><a id="a4847"></a><span class="t30">Now we read that magnificent presents were made to the Fortunate One and his company, and they were held in great respect, as it is written: &lsquo;At that time the Fortunate One was honoured and revered, respected, reverenced, highly esteemed, and received rich presents &ndash; robes, food, lodgement, drugs and medicines, and provisions; and the Saṅgha was honoured, etc. (as before); but the pilgrims of heterodox schools were not honoured, etc. (as before).&rdquo;</span><a id="a4848"></a><a href="notes.html#a15168"><span class="t9">{448}</span></a><span class="t30"> Well, the sectaries, finding that honour and gifts diminished, convened a secret meeting for deliberation. &ldquo;Since the appearance of the ascetic Gotama,&rdquo; they said, </span><span class="t18">{2.170}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;honour and gifts come no more to us, but he has got the best of both. What can be the reason of his good fortune?&rdquo; Then one of them spoke as follows. &ldquo;Ascetic Gotama has the best and chief place in all Jambudīpa to live in, and that is the reason of his success.&rdquo; Then the others said: &ldquo;If this is the reason, we will make a rival settlement above Jetavana, and then we shall receive presents.&rdquo; This was the conclusion they came to. </span><span class="t18">[2.119]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; thought they, &ldquo;if we make our settlement unknown to the king, the monks will prevent us. If he accepts a present, he will not be disinclined to break up their settlement. So we had best bribe him to give us a place for ours.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So by the intervention of his courtiers, they offered a hundred thousand pieces to the king, with this message, &ldquo;Great king, we want to make a rival settlement in Jetavana. If the monks tell you they won&rsquo;t permit it, please do not give them any answer.&rdquo; To this the king agreed, because he wanted the bribe.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After thus conciliating the king, the schismatics got an architect and put the work in hand. There was a good deal of noise about it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;What is all this great noise and tumult, Ānanda?&rdquo; the Teacher asked. &ldquo;The noise,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is some sectaries who are having a new settlement built.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is not a fit place,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;for them to settle. These sectaries are fond of noise; there&rsquo;s no living with them.&rdquo; Then he called the Saṅgha together, and bade them go inform the king, and have the building put a stop to.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4849"></a><span class="t30">The monks went and stood by the palace door. The king, as soon as he heard of their coming, knew they must be come about stopping the new settlement. But he had been bribed, and so he ordered his attendants to say the king was not at home. The monks went back and told the Teacher. The Teacher guessed that a bribe had been given, and sent his two chief disciples.</span><a id="a4850"></a><a href="notes.html#a15170"><span class="t9">{449}</span></a><span class="t30"> But the king, as soon as he heard of their coming, gave the same order as before; and they too returned and told the Teacher. The Teacher said: &ldquo;Doubtless the king is not able to stay at home today; he must be out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Next forenoon, he dressed himself, took his bowl and robe, and with five hundred monks walked to the door of the palace. The king heard them come; he descended from the upper story, and took from the Buddha his alms-bowl. Then he gave rice and gruel to him and his followers, and with a salutation sat down on one side.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher began an exposition for the king&rsquo;s benefit, in these words. &ldquo;Great king, other kings in by-gone days have taken bribes, and then by making virtuous people quarrel together have been dispossessed of their kingdom, and been utterly destroyed.&rdquo; And then, at his request, the Teacher told a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{2.171}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, king Bharu was reigning over the kingdom of Bharu. At the same time the Bodhisatta was teacher of a group of monks. He was an ascetic who had acquired the five Super Knowledges and eight Attainments; and he dwelt a long time in the region of the Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">He came down from the Himālayas to buy salt and seasoning, followed by five hundred ascetics; and they came by stages to the city of Bharu. He went begging through the city; and then coming forth from it, he sat down by the northern gate, at the root of a banyan tree all covered with twigs and branches. There he made a meal, and there he took up his abode.</p>
<p class="p7">Now when that band of ascetics had dwelt there for the space of half a moon, there came another teacher with another five hundred, who went seeking alms about the city, and then came out and sat beneath just such <span class="t18">[2.120] </span>another banyan tree by the south gate, and ate, and dwelt there. And the two bands abode there so long as they would, and then returned again to the Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">When they had gone, the tree by the south gate withered away. Next time, they who had dwelt under it came first, and perceiving that their tree was withered, they first went on their rounds throughout the city, seeking alms, and then passing out by the northern gate, they ate and lived under the banyan tree that was by that gate. And the other band, coming afterwards, went their rounds in the city, and then made ready their meal and would have dwelt by their own tree. &ldquo;This is not your tree, &rsquo;tis ours!&rdquo; they cried; and they began to quarrel about the tree. The quarrel waxed great; these said: &ldquo;Take not the place where we dwelt previously!&rdquo; and those, &ldquo;This time we came first; do not you take it!&rdquo; So crying aloud each that they were the owners of it, they all went to the king&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p class="p7">The king ordered that they who had first dwelt there should hold it. <span class="t18">{2.172}</span><a id="a4851"></a> Then the others thought: &ldquo;We will not allow ourselves to say that we have been beaten by these!&rdquo; They looked about them with divine vision,<a id="a4852"></a><a href="notes.html#a15172"><span class="t9">{450}</span></a> and observing the body of a chariot fit for an emperor to use, they took it and offered it as a gift to the king, begging him to give them too possession of the tree. He took their gift, and ordained that both should dwell under the tree; and so they were there all masters together. Then the other ascetics fetched the jewelled wheels of the same chariot, and offered them to the king, praying him, &ldquo;O mighty king, make us to possess the tree alone!&rdquo; And the king did so.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the ascetics repented, and said: &ldquo;To think that we, who have overcome the love of riches and the lust of the flesh, and have renounced the world, should fall to quarrelling by reason of a tree, and offer bribes for it! This is no seemly thing.&rdquo; And they went away in all haste till they came to the Himālayas. And all the spirits that dwelt in the realm of Bharu with one mind were angry with the king, and they brought up the sea, and for the space of three hundred leagues they made the kingdom of Bharu as though it were not. And so for the sake of the king of Bharu alone, all the inhabitants of the kingdom perished thus.</p>
<p class="p7">When the Teacher had ended this tale, after Fully Awakening, he uttered the following verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4853"></a><a id="a4854"></a><a id="a4855"></a><a id="a4856"></a><a id="a4857"></a><span class="t12">1. Isīnam-antaraṁ katvā, Bharurājā ti me sutaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p23"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this story, he added, &ldquo;Great king, one should not be under the power of desire. Two ascetics ought not to quarrel together.&rdquo; Then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;In those days, I was the leader of the sages.&rdquo; When the king had entertained the Tathāgata, and he had departed, the king sent some men and had the rival settlement destroyed, and the sectaries became homeless.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;That which can drink.&rdquo;</span><a id="a4882"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying at Jetavana, about the Perfection of Wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On one occasion, the monks were gathered in the Dhamma Hall, talking of the Tathāgata&rsquo;s wisdom. &ldquo;Friend, the Supreme Buddha&rsquo;s wisdom is great, and wide, cutting, and quick, sharp, penetrating, and full of resource.&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and asked what they talked about as they sat there together. They told him. &ldquo;Not only is the Tathāgata wise this one time, but he was wise before, and had skill in means.&rdquo; And then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta came into the world as the son of the court family priest. When he grew up, he studied at Taxila; and at his father&rsquo;s death he received the office of family priest, and he was the king&rsquo;s counsellor in things human and divine.</p>
<p class="p7">Afterwards the king opened his ear to those who provoke quarrels, and in anger bade the Bodhisatta dwell before his face no more, and sent him away from Benares. So he took his wife and family with him, and lived in a certain village of Kāsi. Afterward the king remembered his goodness, and said to himself: <span class="t18">[2.122]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;It is not meet that I should send a messenger to fetch my teacher. I will compose a verse of poetry, <span class="t18">{2.174}</span> and write it upon a leaf; I will cause crow&rsquo;s flesh to be cooked; and after I have tied up letter and meat in a white cloth, I will seal it with the king&rsquo;s seal, and send it to him. If he is wise, when he has read the letter and seen that it is crow&rsquo;s-meat, he will come; if not, then he will not come.&rdquo; And so he wrote on the leaf this verse:</p>

<p class="p23">This verse did the king write upon a leaf, and sent it to the Bodhisatta. He read the letter, and thinking: &ldquo;The king wishes to see me,&rdquo; he repeated the second verse: <span class="t18">{2.175}</span></p>

The circumstances which gave rise to it will be set forth under the Mahātakkārijātaka [Ja 481].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4931"></a><span class="t34">During one rainy season the two chief disciples, desiring to leave the multitude and to dwell apart, took leave of the Teacher, and went into the kingdom where Kokālika was. They repaired to the residence of Kokālika, and said this to him, &ldquo;Monk Kokālika, since for us it is delightful to dwell with you, and for you to dwell with us, we would abide here three months.&rdquo; &ldquo;How,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;will it be delightful for you to dwell with me?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;If you tell not a soul that the two chief disciples are dwelling here, we shall be happy, and that will be our delight in dwelling with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;And how is it delightful for me to dwell with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;We will teach the Dhamma to you for three months in your home, and we will discourse to you, and that will be your delight in dwelling with us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dwell here, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so long as you will,&rdquo; and he allotted a pleasant residence to them. There they dwelt in the fruition of the Attainments, and no man knew of their dwelling in that place.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When they had thus past the rains they said to him, &ldquo;Monk, now we have dwelt with you, and we will go to visit the Teacher,&rdquo; and asked his leave to go. He agreed, and went with them on the rounds for alms in a village over against the place where they were. After their meal the elders departed from the village. Kokālika leaving them, turned back and said to the people, &ldquo;Lay brethren, you are like brute animals. Here the two chief disciples have been dwelling for three months in the monastery opposite, and you knew nothing of it: now they are gone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did you not tell us, sir?&rdquo; the people asked.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then they took ghee and oil and medicines, raiment and clothes, and approached the elders, saluting them and saying: &ldquo;Pardon us, sirs we knew not you were the chief disciples, we have learned it but today by the words of the venerable monk Kokālika. Pray have compassion on us, and receive these medicines and clothes.&rdquo; Kokālika went after the elders with them, for he thought: &ldquo;The elders are frugal, and content with little; they will not accept these things, and then they will be given to me.&rdquo; But the elders, because the gift was offered at the instigation of a monk, neither accepted the things themselves nor had them given to Kokālika. The lay folk then said: &ldquo;Sirs, if you will not accept these, come here once again to bless us.&rdquo; The elders promised, and proceeded to the Teacher&rsquo;s presence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now Kokālika was angry, because the elders neither accepted those things themselves, nor had them given to him. The elders, however, having remained a short while with the Teacher, each chose five hundred monks as their following, and with these thousand monks went on pilgrimage seeking alms, as far as Kokālika&rsquo;s country. The lay folk came out to meet them, and led them to the same monastery, and showed them great honour day by day.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Great was the store given them of clothes and of medicines. Those monks who went out with the elders dividing the garments gave of them to all the monks which had come, but to Kokālika gave none, neither did the elders give him any. Getting no clothes Kokālika began to abuse and revile the elders, &ldquo;Sāriputta and Moggallāna are full of wicked desire; they would not accept before what was offered them, but these things they do accept. There is no satisfying them, they have no regard for another.&rdquo; But the elders, perceiving that the man was harbouring evil on their account, set out with their followers to depart; nor would they return, not though the people begged them to stay yet a few days longer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4932"></a><span class="t34">Then a young monk said: &ldquo;Where shall the elders stay, laymen? Your own particular elder does not wish them to stay here.&rdquo; Then the people went to Kokālika, and said: &ldquo;Sir, we are told you do not wish the elders to stay here. Go to! Either appease them and bring them back, or away with you and live elsewhere!&rdquo; In fear of the people this man went and made his request to the elders. &ldquo;Go back, monk,&rdquo; answered the elders, &ldquo;we will not return.&rdquo; So he, being unable to prevail upon them, returned to the monastery. Then the lay brethren asked him whether the elders had returned. &ldquo;I could not persuade them to return,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why not, monk?&rdquo; they asked. And then they began to think it must be no good monks would dwell there because the man did wrong, and they must get rid of him. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;do not stay here; we have nothing here for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Thus dishonoured by them, he took bowl and robe and went to Jetavana. After saluting the Teacher, he said: &ldquo;Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna are full of wicked desire, they are in the power of wicked desires!&rdquo; The Teacher replied, &ldquo;Say not so, Kokālika; let your heart, Kokālika, have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna; learn that they are good monks.&rdquo; Kokālika said: &ldquo;You believe in your two chief disciples, sir; I have seen it with my own eyes; they have wicked desires, they have secrets within them, they are wicked men.&rdquo; So he said thrice (though the Teacher would have stayed him), then rose from his seat, and departed. Even as he went on his way there arose over all his body boils of the size of a mustard seed, which grew and grew to the size of a ripe seed of the wood apple tree, burst, and blood ran all over him. Groaning he fell by the gate of Jetavana, maddened with pain.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">A great cry arose, and reached even to the Brahmā Realm, &ldquo;Kokālika has reviled the two chief disciples!&rdquo; Then his spiritual teacher, the Brahmā Tudu by name, learning the fact, came with the intent of appeasing the elders, and said while poised in the air, &ldquo;Kokālika, a cruel thing this you have done; make your peace with the chief disciples.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are you, brother?&rdquo; the man asked. &ldquo;Tudu Brahmā, is my name,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Have you not been declared by the Fortunate One,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;one of those who return not? That word means that such come not back to this earth. You will become a Yakkha upon a dunghill!&rdquo; Thus he upbraided the Mahābrahmā. And as he could not persuade the man to do as he advised, he replied to him, &ldquo;May you be tormented according to your own word.&rdquo; Then he returned to his abode of bliss. And Kokālika after dying was born again in the Lotus Hell. That he had been born there the great and mighty Brahmā told to the Tathāgata, and the Teacher told it to the monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">In the Dhamma Hall the monks talked of the man&rsquo;s wickedness, &ldquo;Monks, they say Kokālika reviled Sāriputta and Moggallāna, and by the words of his own mouth came to the Lotus Hell.&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and said he, &ldquo;What speak you of, monks, as you sit here?&rdquo; They told him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Here again the Teacher said: &ldquo;This is not the only time, monks, that Kokālika has been ruined by talking; it was the same before.&rdquo; And then he told the story as follows.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past Brahmadatta was king of Benares, and the Bodhisatta, being born to one of the king&rsquo;s court, grew up, and became the king&rsquo;s adviser in all things human and divine. But this king was very talkative; and when he talked there was no chance for any other to get in a word. <span class="t18">{2.176}</span> And the Bodhisatta, wishing to put a stop to his much talking, kept watching for an opportunity.</p>
<p class="p7">Now there dwelt a turtle in a certain pond in the region of the Himālayas. Two young wild geese, searching for food, struck up an acquaintance with him; and by and by they grew close friends together. One day these two said to him, &ldquo;Friend turtle, we have a lovely home in the Himālayas, on a plateau of Mount Cittakūṭa, in a cave of gold! Will you come with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how can I get there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, we will take you, if only you can keep your mouth shut, and say not a word to any body.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I can do that,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;take me along!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So they made the turtle hold a stick between his teeth; and themselves taking hold so of the two ends, they sprang up into the air.</p>
<p class="p7">The village children saw this, and exclaimed, &ldquo;There are two geese carrying a turtle by a stick!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">By this time the geese flying swiftly had arrived at the space above the palace of the king, at Benares. The turtle wanted to cry out <span class="t18">[2.124]</span> &ldquo;Well, and if my friends do carry me, what is that to you, you caitiffs?&rdquo; and he let go the stick from between his teeth, and falling into the open courtyard he split in two. What an uproar there was! &ldquo;A turtle has fallen in the courtyard, and broken in two!&rdquo; they cried. The king, with the Bodhisatta, and all his court, came up to the place, and seeing the turtle asked the Bodhisatta a question. &ldquo;Wise sir, what made this creature fall?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s my time!&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;For a long while I have been wishing to admonish the king, and I have gone about seeking my opportunity. No doubt the truth is this: the turtle and the geese became friendly; the geese must have meant to carry him to the Himālayas, and so made him hold a stick between his teeth, and then lifted him into the air; then he must have heard some remark, and wanted to reply; and not being able to keep his mouth shut he must have let himself go; <span class="t18">{2.177}</span> and so he must have fallen from the sky and thus come by his death.&rdquo; So thought he; and addressed the king, &ldquo;O king, they that have too much tongue, that set no limit to their speaking, ever come to such misfortune as this,&rdquo; and he uttered the following verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4933"></a><a id="a4934"></a><a id="a4935"></a><a id="a4936"></a><a id="a4937"></a><a id="a4938"></a><a id="a4939"></a><span class="t12">1. Avadhī vata attānaṁ kacchapo byāharaṁ giraṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p23">&ldquo;He is speaking of me!&rdquo; the king thought to himself; and asked the Bodhisatta if it was so.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Be it you, O great king, or be it another,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;whosoever talks beyond measure comes by some misery of this kind,&rdquo; and so he made the thing manifest. And thenceforward the king abstained from talking, and became a man of few words. <span class="t18">{2.178}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This discourse ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Kokālika was the turtle then, the two famous elders were the two wild geese, Ānanda was the king, and I was his wise adviser.&rdquo;</span></p>

Long ago by her means you came near being spitted and roasted for food, but wise men saved your life.&rdquo; Then he told a tale of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was his family priest. Some fishermen drew out a fish<a id="a4962"></a><a href="notes.html#a15176"><span class="t9">{452}</span></a> which had got caught in their net, and cast it upon hot sand, saying: &ldquo;We will cook it in the embers, and eat.&rdquo; So they sharpened a spit.

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The circumstances have already been given in the First Book.</span><a id="a4997"></a><a href="notes.html#a15180"><span class="t9">{454}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a lay brother who was a greengrocer in Sāvatthi and made a living by the sale of various roots and vegetables, and pumpkins and the like. Now he had a pretty daughter who was as good and virtuous as she was pretty, but was always laughing. And when she was asked in marriage by a family of his own station in life, he thought: &ldquo;She ought to be married, but she&rsquo;s always laughing; and a bad girl married into a strange family is her parents&rsquo; shame. I must find out for certain whether she is a good girl or not.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So one day he made his daughter take a basket and come with him to the forest to gather herbs. Then to try her, he took her by the hand with whispered words of love. Straightaway the girl burst into tears and began to cry out that such a thing would be as monstrous as fire rising out of water, and she besought him to forbear. Then he told her that his only intent was to try her, and asked whether she was virtuous. And she declared that she was and that she had never looked on any man with eyes of love. Calming her fears and taking her back home, he made a feast and gave her in marriage. Then feeling that he ought to go and pay his respects to the Teacher, he took perfumes and garlands in his hand and went to Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Here again the Teacher asked him where he had been so long; and he replied, &ldquo;My daughter, sir, is always smiling. After testing her, I gave her in marriage to a young gentleman. As this had to be done, I had no opportunity of paying you a visit.&rdquo; To this the Teacher answered, &ldquo;Not only now is your daughter virtuous, but virtuous she was in days of yore; and as you have tested her now, so you tested her in those days.&rdquo; And at the man&rsquo;s request he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was a Tree Devatā.</p>
<p class="p7">This same pious greengrocer took it into his head to test his daughter. He led her into the woods, <span class="t18">{2.180}</span> and seized her by the hand, making as though he had conceived a passion for her. And as she cried out in woe, he addressed her in the words of the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4998"></a><a id="a4999"></a><a id="a5000"></a><span class="t12">1. Sabbo loko attamano ahosi,</span></p>

Having grabbed you, you cry out in the woods.</span></p>
<p class="p23">When she heard it, she answered, &ldquo;Dear Father, I am a maid, and I know not the lust of the flesh,&rdquo; and weeping she uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5013"></a><a id="a5014"></a><a id="a5015"></a><a id="a5016"></a><span class="t12">2. Yo dukkhaphuṭṭhāya bhaveyya tāṇaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p23">And the greengrocer, after testing his daughter thus, took her home, and gave her in marriage to a young man. Afterwards he passed away and traveled on according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, at the end of the Truths the greengrocer entered on the Fruit of the First Path, &ldquo;In those days, father and daughter were the same as now, and the Tree Devatā that saw it all was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

The Bodhisatta settles both improbabilities with wisdom.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Well planned indeed!&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [2.127]</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{2.181}</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying in Jetavana, about a dishonest trader.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">There were two traders of Sāvatthi, one pious and the other a cheat. These two joined partnership, and loaded five hundred wagons full of wares, journeying from east to west for trade; and returned to Sāvatthi with large profits.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The pious trader suggested to his partner that they should divide their stock. The rogue thought to himself, &ldquo;This fellow has been roughing it for ever so long with bad food and lodging. Now he&rsquo;s at home again, he&rsquo;ll eat all sorts of dainties and die of a surfeit. Then I shall have all the stock for myself.&rdquo; What he said was, &ldquo;Neither the stars nor the day are favourable; tomorrow or the next day we&rsquo;ll see about it,&rdquo; so he kept putting it off. However, the pious trader pressed him, and the division was made. Then he went with scents and garlands to visit the Teacher; and after a respectful obeisance, he sat on one side. The Teacher asked when he had returned. &ldquo;Just a fortnight ago, sir,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Then why have you delayed to visit the Buddha?&rdquo; The trader explained. Then the Teacher said: &ldquo;It is not only now that your partner is a rogue; he was just the same before,&rdquo; and at his request told him a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta came into this world as the son of one in the king&rsquo;s court. When he grew up he was made a Lord Justice.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5033"></a>At that time, two traders, one from a village and one of the town, were friends together. The villager deposited with the townsman five hundred ploughshares. The other sold these, and kept the price, and in the place where they were he scattered mouse dung. By and by came the villager, and asked for his ploughshare.<a id="a5034"></a><a href="notes.html#a15183"><span class="t9">{455}</span></a> &ldquo;The mice have eaten them up!&rdquo;<a id="a5035"></a><a href="notes.html#a15185"><span class="t9">{456}</span></a> said the cheat, and pointed out the mouse dung to him. <span class="t18">[2.128]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, well, so be it,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;what can be done with things which the mice have eaten?</p>
<p class="p7">Now at the time of bathing he took the other trader&rsquo;s son, and set him in a friend&rsquo;s house, in an inner chamber, bidding them not suffer him to go out any where. <span class="t18">{2.182}</span> And having washed himself he went to his friend&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Where is my son?&rdquo; asked the cheat.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I took him with me and left him on the river side; and when I was gone down into the water, there came a hawk, and seized your son in his extended claws, and flew up into the air. I beat the water, shouted, struggled &ndash; but could not make him let go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Lies!&rdquo; cried the rogue. &ldquo;No hawk could carry off a boy&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Let be, dear friend: if things happen that should not, how can I help it? Your son has been carried off by a hawk, as I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The other reviled him. &ldquo;Ah, you scoundrel! You murderer! Now I will go to the judge, and have you dragged before him!&rdquo; And he departed. The villager said: &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; and went to the court of justice. The rogue addressed the Bodhisatta thus:</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My lord, this fellow took my son with him to bathe, and when I asked where he was, he answered, that a hawk had carried him off. Judge my cause!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Tell the truth,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, asking the other.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Indeed, my lord,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I took him with me, and a falcon has carried him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But where in the world are there hawks which carry off boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I have a question to ask you. If hawks cannot carry off boys into the air, can mice eat iron ploughshares?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My lord, I deposited in this man&rsquo;s house five hundred ploughshares. The man told me that the mice had devoured them, and showed me the droppings of the mice that had done it. My lord, if mice eat ploughshares, then hawks carry off boys: but if mice cannot do this, neither will hawks carry the boy off. This man says the mice ate my ploughshares. Give sentence whether they are eaten or no. <span class="t18">{2.183}</span> Judge my cause!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;He must have meant,&rdquo; thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;to fight the trickster with his own weapons. Well devised!&rdquo; said he, and then he uttered these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5036"></a><a id="a5037"></a><a id="a5038"></a><a id="a5039"></a><span class="t12">1. Saṭhassa sāṭheyyam-idaṁ sucintitaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><a id="a5053"></a><span class="t12">2. Kūṭassa hi santi kūṭakūṭā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5054"></a><a id="a5055"></a><span class="t12">Bhavati cāpi nikatino nikatyā,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><a id="a5057"></a><span class="t12">Mā te puttam-ahāsi phālanaṭṭho ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a5058"></a><a id="a5059"></a><a id="a5060"></a><span class="t4">There is fraud upon fraud for the fraudulent one, there is cheating in return for the one who cheats, he must give the ploughshare to the one who lost it, the one who lost his ploughshare must not steal his child. </span><span class="t18">{2.184}</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus he that had lost his son received him again, and he received his ploughshare that had lost it; and afterwards both passed away to fare according to their deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The cheat in both cases was the same, and so was the clever man; I myself was the Lord Chief Justice.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a5068"></a><a id="a5069"></a><span class="t15">In the present one monk can make no progress owing to discontent. The Buddha tells a story about a monkey who lived with a king and understood mankind&rsquo;s wrongdoing, before being set free and reporting it to his fellows. They blocked their ears rather than listen.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a5070"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the lord of the monkeys (vānarinda),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the Buddha&rsquo;s disciples = the group of monkeys (vānaragaṇa).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;The gold is mine.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a monk who was downcast and discontent.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5072"></a><span class="t30">This man could not concentrate his mind on any single object, but his life was all full of discontent; and this was told to the Teacher. When asked by the Teacher if he really were discontented, he said yes; asked why, he replied that it was through his passions. &ldquo;O monk!&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;this passion has been despised even by the lower animals; and can you, a monk in such a dispensation, yield to discontent arising from the passion that even brutes despise?&rdquo; Then he told him a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta reigned over Benares, the Bodhisatta came into the world as a monkey, in the region of the Himālayas. A forester caught him, brought him home and gave him to the king. For a long time he dwelt with the king, serving him faithfully, and he learned a great deal about the manners of the world of men. The king was <span class="t18">[2.130] </span>pleased at his faithfulness. He sent for the forester, and bade him set the monkey free in the very place where he had been caught; and so he did.</p>
<p class="p7">All the monkey tribe gathered together upon the face of a huge rock, to see the Bodhisatta now that he had come back to them; and they spoke pleasantly to him.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sir, where have you been living this long time?&rdquo; &ldquo;In the king&rsquo;s palace at Benares.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then how did you get free?&rdquo; &ldquo;The king made me his pet monkey, and being pleased with my tricks, he let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The monkeys went on, &ldquo;You must know the manner of living in the world of men: <span class="t18">{2.185}</span><a id="a5073"></a> tell us about it too &ndash; we want to hear!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me the manner of men&rsquo;s living,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;Do tell &ndash; we want to hear!&rdquo; they said again.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Mankind,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;both princes and brahmins, cry out &ndash; &lsquo;Mine! Mine!&rsquo; They know not of the impermanence, by which the things that be are not. Hear now the way of these blind fools,&rdquo; and he spoke these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5074"></a><a id="a5075"></a><a id="a5076"></a><span class="t12">1. Hiraññaṁ me suvaṇṇaṁ me, esā rattiṁ divā kathā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5077"></a><span class="t12">Dummedhānaṁ manussānaṁ Ar</span><span class="t46">i</span><span class="t12">yadhammaṁ apassataṁ.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><a id="a5083"></a><a id="a5084"></a><span class="t12">2. Dve dve gahapatayo gehe, eko tattha amassuko,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5085"></a><a id="a5086"></a><span class="t12">Lambatthano veṇikato, atho aṅkitakaṇṇako,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5087"></a><a id="a5088"></a><span class="t12">Kīto dhanena bahunā, so taṁ vitudate janan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a5089"></a><a id="a5090"></a><a id="a5091"></a><a id="a5092"></a><a id="a5093"></a><a id="a5094"></a><a id="a5095"></a><span class="t4">There are two householders in the house, one has no beard in that place, pendulant breasts, plaited hair, and perforated ears, being bought with lots of wealth, she attacks the people. </span><span class="t18">{2.186}</span></p>
<p class="p23">On hearing this, all the monkeys cried out, &ldquo;Stop, stop! We have heard what it is not meet to hear!&rdquo; and with both hands they stopped their ears tight. And they liked not the place, because they said: &ldquo;In this place we heard a thing not seemly,&rdquo; so they went elsewhere. And this rock went by the name of Garahitapiṭṭhi Rock, or the Rock of Blaming.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths this monk reached the Fruit of the First Path. &ldquo;The Buddha&rsquo;s present followers were that troop of monkeys, and their chief was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
