<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present a supporter of Ven. Ānanda&rsquo;s tries to tempt him back to the lay life by offering him half his wealth. Ven. Ānanda refuses though, as the household life is full of suffering. The Buddha tells a story of similar events which unfolded in a previous life.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a5588"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (the wanderer) Vacchanakha,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Roja the Mallian = the wealthy man of Benares (Bārāṇasīseṭṭhi).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a5589"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Attachment, Desire.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Houses in the world are sweet.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about Roja the Mallian.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">We learn that this man, who was a lay friend of Ānanda&rsquo;s, sent the elder a message that he should come to him. The elder took leave of the Teacher, and went. He served the elder with all sorts of food, and sat down on one side, engaging him in a pleasant conversation. Then he offered the elder a share of his house, tempting him by the five channels of desire. &ldquo;Ānanda, sir, I have at home great store of live and dead stock. I will divide it and give you half; let us live in one house together!&rdquo; The elder declared to him the suffering which is involved in desire; then rose from his seat, and returned to the monastery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher asked whether he had seen Roja, he replied that he had. &ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, Roja invited me to return to the world; then I explained to him the suffering involved in desires and the worldly life.&rdquo; The Teacher said: &ldquo;Ānanda, this is not the first time that Roja the Mallian has invited ascetics to return to the world; he did the same before,&rdquo; and then, at his request, he told a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{2.232}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was one of a family of brahmins who lived in a certain market town. Coming to years, he took up the ascetic life, and dwelt for a long time amid the Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">He went to Benares to purchase salt and seasoning, and lived in the king&rsquo;s grounds; next day he entered Benares. <span class="t18">[2.161]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now a certain rich man of the place, pleased at his behaviour, took him home, gave him to eat, and receiving his promise to abide with him, caused him to dwell in the garden and attended to his wants. And they conceived a friendship each for the other.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, the rich man, by reason of his love and friendship for the Bodhisatta, thought this within himself, &ldquo;The life of an ascetic is unhappy. I will persuade my friend Vacchanakha to unfrock himself; I will part my wealth in two, and give half to him, and we both will dwell together.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So one day, when the meal was done, he spake sweetly to his friend and said: &ldquo;Good Vacchanakha, unhappy is the ascetic&rsquo;s life; &rsquo;tis pleasant to live in a house. Come now, let us both together take our pleasure as we will.&rdquo; So saying, he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5590"></a><a id="a5591"></a><a id="a5592"></a><span class="t12">1. Sukhā gharā, Vacchanakha, sahiraññā sabhojanā,</span></p>

<p class="p23">The Bodhisatta on hearing him, thus replied, &ldquo;Good sir, from ignorance you have become greedy in desire, and call the householder&rsquo;s life good, and the life of the ascetic bad; listen now, and I will tell you how bad is the householder&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; and he uttered the second verse: <span class="t18">{2.233}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5602"></a><a id="a5603"></a><a id="a5604"></a><a id="a5605"></a><a id="a5606"></a><a id="a5607"></a><a id="a5608"></a><span class="t12">2. Gharā nānīhamānassa, gharā nābhaṇato &rsquo;musā,</span></p>

<p class="p23">With these words the great Buddha told the defects of a householder&rsquo;s life, and went into the garden again.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Roja the Mallian was the Benares merchant, and I was Vacchanakha the mendicant.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one deceitful monk is brought to the Buddha, who tells a story of how a heron had stood in the water trying to fool the fish into believing he was no threat to them, only to be discovered by the king of the fish.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a5626"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the king of the fish (maccharājā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a5627"></a><a id="a5628"></a><span class="t15">the monk = the deceitful heron (baka).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a5629"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Deceit, Treachery, Animals, Birds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;See that twice-born bird.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying in Jetavana, about a deceitful person. When he was brought before the Teacher, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, he was a deceitful person of old just as he is now,&rdquo; and told the following story.</span><span class="t18"> [2.162]</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{2.234}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5630"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta became a fish in a certain pond in the Himālayas region, and a great shoal went with him. Now a crane desired to eat the fish. So in a place near the pond he drooped his head, and spread out his wings, and looked vacantly, vacantly at the fish, waiting till they were off their guard.<a id="a5631"></a><a href="notes.html#a15225"><span class="t9">{473}</span></a> At the same moment the Bodhisatta with his shoal came to that place in search of food. And the shoal of fish on seeing the crane uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5632"></a><a id="a5633"></a><a id="a5634"></a><a id="a5635"></a><a id="a5636"></a><span class="t12">1. Bhaddako vatayaṁ pakkhī, dijo kumudasannibho,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a5640"></a><span class="t4">That excellent bird, twice-born, resembling a white water-lily, with its wings both settled and calm, he meditates like a great fool.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Then the Bodhisatta looked, and uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5641"></a><a id="a5642"></a><span class="t12">2. Nāssa sīlaṁ vijānātha, anaññāya pasaṁsatha,</span></p>

<p class="p23">Thereupon the fish splashed in the water and drove the crane away.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;This deceitful person was the crane, and I was the chief of the shoal of fish.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Why are hearts cold.&rdquo;</span><a id="a5657"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told during a stay near Sāketa, about a brahmin named Sāketa. Both the circumstances that suggested the story and the story itself have already been given in the First Book.</span><a id="a5658"></a><a href="notes.html#a15229"><span class="t9">{475}</span></a><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.163]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5659"></a><span class="t34">This story was told by the Teacher, while at Añjanavana, about a certain brahmin. Tradition says that when the Fortunate One with his disciples was entering the city of Sāketa, an old brahmin of that place, who was going out, met him in the gateway. Falling at the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; feet, and clasping him by the ankles, the old man cried, &ldquo;Son, is it not the duty of children to cherish the old age of their parents? Why have you not let us see you all this long time? At last I have seen you; come, let your mother see you too.&rdquo; So saying, he took the Teacher with him to his house; and there the Teacher sat upon the seat prepared for him, with his disciples around him. Then came the brahmin&rsquo;s wife, and she too fell at the feet of the Fortunate One, crying, &ldquo;My son, where have you been all this time? Is it not the duty of children to comfort their parents in their old age?&rdquo; Hereon, she called to her sons and daughters that their brother was come, and made them salute the Buddha. And in their joy the aged pair showed great hospitality to their guests. After his meal, the Teacher recited to the old people the Sutta concerning old-age; and, when he had ended, both husband and wife won fruition of the Second Path. Then rising up from his seat, the Teacher went back to Añjanavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Meeting together in the Dhamma Hall, the monks fell to talking about this thing. It was urged that the brahmin must have been well aware that Suddhodana was the father, and Mahāmāyā the mother, of the Tathāgata; yet none the less, he and his wife had claimed the Tathāgata as their own son &ndash; and that with the Teacher&rsquo;s assent. What could it all mean? Hearing their talk, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, the aged pair were right in claiming me as their son.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Monks, in ages past this brahmin was my father in 500 successive births, my uncle in a like number, and in 500 more my grandfather. And in 1500 successive births his wife was respectively my mother, my aunt, and my grandmother. So I was brought up in 1500 births by this brahmin, and in 1500 by his wife. </span><span class="t35">{2.235}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5660"></a><a id="a5661"></a>And when the Tathāgata had gone to the monastery, the monk asked, &ldquo;How, sir, did the love begin?&rdquo; and repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5662"></a><a id="a5663"></a><a id="a5664"></a><span class="t12">1. Ko nu kho Bhagavā hetu, ekacce idha puggale,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5665"></a><a id="a5666"></a><span class="t12">Atīva hadayaṁ nibbāti, cittañ-cāpi pasīdatī ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a5667"></a><a id="a5668"></a><span class="t4">What is the reason, Bhagavā, some people here, have a heart extremely cool, and a mind of faith?</span></p>
<p class="p23">The Teacher explained the nature of love by the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5669"></a><a id="a5670"></a><a id="a5671"></a><span class="t12">2. Pubbeva sannivāsena paccuppannahitena vā,</span></p>

<p class="p23"><span class="t30">After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;These two people were the brahmin and his wife in the story; and I was their son.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one boy asks his father a question about how to accomplish his purpose, and his father takes him to the Buddha to get the answer. The Buddha tells a story about how a similar question was asked in the past, and how he as Bodhisatta had answered it.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a5684"></a><span class="t30">We are told that there was a landowner who lived at Sāvatthi. One day, his son sitting on his hip asked him what is called the &ldquo;Door&rdquo;</span><a id="a5685"></a><a href="notes.html#a15231"><span class="t9">{476}</span></a><a id="a5686"></a><a id="a5687"></a><a id="a5688"></a><span class="t30"> question. He replied, &ldquo;That question requires a Buddha; nobody else can answer it.&rdquo; So he took his son to Jetavana, and saluted the Teacher. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as my son sat on my hip, he asked me the question called the &lsquo;Door.&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t know the answer, so here I am to ask you to give it.&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;This is not the first time, layman, that the lad has been a seeker after the way to accomplish his ends, and asked wise men this question; he did so before, and wise men in olden days gave him the answer; but by reason of a multitude of rebirths, he has forgotten it.&rdquo; And at his request the Teacher told a tale of the olden time.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came into this world as a rich merchant&rsquo;s son. He grew up, and when in course of time the father died, he took his father&rsquo;s place as a merchant. <span class="t18">[2.164]</span></p>
<p class="p7">And his son, a young boy, sitting on his hip, asked him a question, &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tell me a thing in one word which embraces a wide range of meaning,&rdquo; and he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5689"></a><a id="a5690"></a><a id="a5691"></a><a id="a5692"></a><a id="a5693"></a><a id="a5694"></a><a id="a5695"></a><a id="a5696"></a><span class="t12">1. Iṅgha ekapadaṁ, tāta, anekatthapadassitaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p23">His father replied with the second:</p>

<p class="p23">Thus did the Bodhisatta answer his son&rsquo;s question. The son used the way which his father pointed out to accomplish his purposes, and by and by he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths father and son reached the Fruit of the First Path, &ldquo;This man was then the son, and I was the merchant of Benares myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Ajātasattu, after killing his father, finds himself at war with his uncle, and victory goes back and forth. The Buddha tells a story of a water snake who used to eat fish, but when caught in a fish trap, was set upon and killed by the fish.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;When I was in their cage.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, about Ajātasattu.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5724"></a><span class="t30">Mahākosala, the king of Kosala&rsquo;s father, when he married his daughter to king Bimbisāra, had given her a village in Kāsi to support her. After Ajātasattu murdered Bimbisāra, his father, the queen very soon died of love for him. Even after his mother&rsquo;s death, Ajātasattu still enjoyed the revenues of this village. But the king of Kosala determined that no parricide should have a village which was his by right of inheritance, and made war upon him. Sometimes the uncle got the best of it, and sometimes the nephew. And when Ajātasattu was victor, he raised his banner and marched through the country back to his capital in triumph; but when he lost, all downcast he returned without letting any one know.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">It happened on a day that the monks sat talking about it in the Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; so one would say, &ldquo;Ajātasattu is delighted when he beats his uncle, and when he loses he is cast down.&rdquo; The Teacher, entering the Hall, asked what they were discussing this time; </span><span class="t18">{2.238}</span><span class="t30"> and they told him. He said: &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time that the man has been happy when he conquered, and miserable when he did not.&rdquo; And he told them a story. </span><span class="t18">[2.165]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta became a green frog. At the time people set wicker cages in all pits and holes of the rivers, to catch fish withal. In one cage were a large number of fish. And a water-snake, eating fish, went into the trap himself. A number of the fish thronging together fell to biting him, until he was covered with blood. Seeing no help for it, in fear of his life he slipped out of the mouth of the cage, and lay down full of pain on the edge of the water. At the same moment, the green frog took a leap and fell into the mouth of the trap. The snake, not knowing to whom he could appeal, asked the frog that he saw there in the trap, &ldquo;Friend frog, are you pleased with the behaviour of yonder fish?&rdquo; and he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5725"></a><a id="a5726"></a><a id="a5727"></a><a id="a5728"></a><a id="a5729"></a><a id="a5730"></a><span class="t12">1. Āsīvisam-pi maṁ santaṁ paviṭṭhaṁ kumināmukhaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present, after attacking the Buddha multiple times, Devadatta is finally swallowed up by the earth and everyone rejoices. The Buddha tells a story of how one vicious king&rsquo;s death was celebrated except by one porter, who feared hell would reject him and he might come to life again.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a5750"></a><span class="t15">Devadatta = (the unjust king) Mahāpiṅgala,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a5752"></a><span class="t33">&ldquo;The tawny king.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at the Jetavana, about Devadatta the heretic.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Devadatta for nine months had tried to compass the destruction of the future Buddha, and had sunk down into the earth by the gateway of Jetavana.</span><span class="t18"> [2.166]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then they that dwelt at Jetavana and in all the country round about were delighted, saying: &ldquo;Devadatta the enemy of Buddha has been swallowed up in the earth: the adversary is slain, and the Teacher has become perfectly Awakened!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{2.240}</span><span class="t30"> And hearing these words spoken many a time and oft, the people of all the continent of Jambudīpa, and all the Yakkhas, and Bhūtas, and Devas were delighted likewise.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day, all the monks were talking together in the Dhamma Hall, and thus would they say, &ldquo;Monk, since Devadatta sank into the earth, what a number of people are glad, saying, Devadatta is swallowed up by the earth!&rdquo; The Teacher entered, and asked, &ldquo;What are you all talking about here, monks?&rdquo; They told him. Then said he, &ldquo;This is not the first time, O monks, that multitudes have rejoiced and laughed aloud at the death of Devadatta. Long ago they rejoiced and laughed as they do now.&rdquo; And he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5753"></a><a id="a5754"></a>In the past reigned at Benares a wicked and unjust king named Mahāpiṅgala, the tawny king, who did sinfully after his own will and pleasure. With taxes and fines, and many mutilations<a id="a5755"></a><a href="notes.html#a15233"><span class="t9">{477}</span></a> and robberies, he crushed the folk as it were sugar-cane in a mill; he was cruel, fierce, ferocious. For other people he had not a grain of pity; at home he was harsh and implacable towards his wives, his sons and daughters, to his brahmin courtiers and the householders of the country. He was like a speck of dust that falls in the eye, like gravel in the broth, like a thorn sticking in the heel.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the Bodhisatta was a son of king Mahāpiṅgala. After this king had reigned for a long time, he died. When he died all the citizens of Benares were overjoyed and laughed a great laugh; they burnt his body with a thousand cartloads of logs, and quenched the place of burning with thousands of jars of water, and consecrated the Bodhisatta to be king: they caused a drum of rejoicing to beat about the streets, for joy that they had got them a righteous king. They raised flags and banners, and decked out the city; at every door was set a pavilion, and scattering parched corn and flowers, they sat them down upon the decorated platforms under fine canopies, and did eat and drink. The Bodhisatta himself sat upon a fine divan <span class="t18">{2.241}</span> on a great raised dais, in great magnificence, with a white parasol stretched above him. The courtiers and householders, the citizens and the doorkeepers stood around their king.</p>
<p class="p7">But one doorkeeper, standing not far from the king, was sighing and sobbing. &ldquo;Good Porter,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, observing him, &ldquo;all the people are making merry for joy that my father is dead, but you stand weeping. Come, was my father good and kind to you?&rdquo; And with the question he uttered the first verse: <span class="t18">[2.167]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5756"></a><span class="t12">1. Sabbo jano hiṁsito Piṅgalena,</span></p>

Why are you crying, watchman of the door?</span></p>
<p class="p23">The man heard, and answered, &ldquo;I am not weeping for sorrow that Piṅgala is dead. My head would be glad enough. For king Piṅgala, every time he came down from the palace, or went up into it, would give me eight blows over the head with his fist, like the blows of a blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer. So when he goes down to the other world, he will deal eight blows on the head of Yama, the gatekeeper of hell, as though he were striking me. Then the people there will cry: &lsquo;He is too cruel for us!&rsquo; And will send him up again. And I fear he will come and deal fisticuffs on my head again, and that is why I weep.&rdquo; To explain the matter he uttered the second verse:<a id="a5766"></a><a href="notes.html#a15235"><span class="t9">{478}</span></a> <span class="t18">{2.242}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5767"></a><a id="a5768"></a><a id="a5769"></a><a id="a5770"></a><span class="t12">2. Na me piyo āsi akaṇhanetto,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><span class="t4">The one with tawny eyes wasn&rsquo;t dear to me, but his coming back I truly do fear, going from here should he harrass Death&rsquo;s King, being harrassed he may sent him back here.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a5772"></a>Then said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;That king has been burnt with a thousand cartloads of wood; the place of his burning has been soaked with water from thousands of pitchers, and the ground has been dug up all round; beings that have gone to the other world, except by force of fate,<a id="a5773"></a><a href="notes.html#a15237"><span class="t9">{479}</span></a> do not return to the same bodily shape as they had before; do not be afraid!&rdquo; To comfort him, he repeated the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5774"></a><a id="a5775"></a><a id="a5776"></a><span class="t12">3. Daḍḍho vāhasahassehi, sitto ghaṭasatehi so,</span></p>

<p class="p23">After that, the porter took comfort. And the Bodhisatta ruled in righteousness; and after giving gifts and doing other good acts, he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Devadatta was Piṅgala; and his son was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Devadatta is prospering, until the Buddha overcame the elephant Nāḷāgiri, which was sent to kill him, at which point his reputation faded.

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Even as the jackal.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.168]</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying in the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5789"></a><span class="t30">Devadatta, having won favour in the eyes of Ajātasattu, yet could not make the repute and support which he received last any time. Ever since they saw the miracle</span><a id="a5790"></a><a href="notes.html#a15239"><span class="t9">{480}</span></a><span class="t30"> done when Nāḷāgiri was sent against him, the reputation and receipts of Devadatta began to fall off. </span><span class="t18">{2.243}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So one day, the monks were all talking about it in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Monks, Devadatta managed to get reputation and support, yet could not keep it up. This happened in olden days in just the same way.&rdquo; And then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5791"></a>In the past, Brahmadatta was king of Benares, and the Bodhisatta was his family priest; and he had mastered the three Vedas and the eighteen branches of knowledge. He knew the mantra entitled &lsquo;Of subduing the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p7">One day, the Bodhisatta thought that he would recite this spell; so he sat down in a place apart upon a flat stone, and there went through his reciting of it. It is said that this spell could be taught to no one without use of a special rite; for which reason he recited it in the place just described. It so happened that a jackal lying in a hole heard the spell at the time that he was reciting it, and got it by heart. We are told that this jackal in a previous existence had been some brahmin who had learned the charm &lsquo;Of subduing the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta ended his recitation, and rose up, saying: &ldquo;Surely I have that spell by heart now.&rdquo; Then the jackal arose out of his hole, and cried, &ldquo;Ho, brahmin! I have learned the spell better than you know it yourself!&rdquo; and off he ran. The Bodhisatta set off in chase, and followed some way, crying, &ldquo;That jackal will do a great mischief &ndash; catch him, catch him!&rdquo; But the jackal got clear off into the forest.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5792"></a>The jackal found a female jackal, and gave her a little nip upon the body. &ldquo;What is it, master?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Do you know me,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;or do you not?&rdquo;<a id="a5793"></a><a href="notes.html#a15241"><span class="t9">{481}</span></a> &ldquo;I do not know you.&rdquo; He repeated the spell, and thus got <span class="t18">[2.169] </span>under his orders several hundreds of jackals, and gathered round him all the elephants and horses, lions and tigers, swine and deer, and all other fourfooted creatures; <span class="t18">{2.244}</span><a id="a5794"></a> and their king he became, under the title of Sabbadāṭha, or All-tusk, and the she-jackal he made his consort. On the back of two elephants stood a lion, and on the lion&rsquo;s back sat Sabbadāṭha, the jackal king, along with his consort the she-jackal; and great honour was paid to them.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the jackal was tempted by his great honour, and became puffed up with pride, and he resolved to capture the kingdom of Benares. So with all the fourfooted creatures in his train, he came to a place near to Benares. His host covered twelve leagues of ground. From his position there he sent a message to the king, &ldquo;Give up your kingdom, or fight for it.&rdquo; The citizens of Benares, smitten with terror, shut close their gates and stayed within.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the Bodhisatta drew near the king, and said to him, &ldquo;Fear not, mighty king! Leave me the task of fighting with the jackal king, Sabbadāṭha. Except only me, no one is able to fight with him at all.&rdquo; Thus he gave heart to the king and the citizens. &ldquo;I will ask him at once,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;what he will do in order to take the city.&rdquo; So he mounted the tower over one of the gates, and cried out, &ldquo;Sabbadāṭha, what will you do to get possession of this realm?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I will cause the lions to roar, and with the roaring I will frighten the multitude: thus will I take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; thought the Bodhisatta, and down he came from the tower. He made proclamation by beat of drum that all the dwellers in the great city of Benares, over all its twelve leagues, must stop up their ears with flour. The multitude heard the command; they stopped up their own ears with flour, so that they could not hear each other speak: nay, they even did the same to their cats and other animals.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the Bodhisatta went up a second time into the tower, and cried out, &ldquo;Sabbadāṭha!&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it, brahmin?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;How will you take this realm?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I will cause the lions to roar, and I will frighten the people, and destroy them; thus will I take it!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;You will not be able to make the lions roar; these noble lions, with their tawny paws and shaggy manes, will never do the bidding of an old jackal like you! The jackal, stubborn with pride, <span class="t18">{2.245}</span> answered, &ldquo;Not only will the other lions obey me, but I&rsquo;ll even make this one, upon whose back I sit, roar alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;do it if you can.&rdquo; So he tapped with his foot on the lion which he sat upon, to roar.<span class="t18"> [2.170]</span></p>
<p class="p7">And the lion resting his mouth upon the elephant&rsquo;s temple, roared thrice, without any manner of doubt. The elephants were terrified and dropped the jackal down at their feet; they trampled upon his head and crushed it to atoms. Then and there Sabbadāṭha perished. And the elephants, hearing the roar of the lion, were frightened to death, and wounding one another, they all perished there. The rest of the creatures, deer and swine, down to the hares and cats, perished then and there, all except the lions; and these ran off and took to the woods. There was a heap of carcases covering the ground for twelve leagues.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta came down from the tower, and had the gates of the city thrown open. By beat of drum he caused proclamation to be made throughout the city, &ldquo;Let all the people take the flour from out of their ears, and they that desire meat, meat let them take!&rdquo; The people all ate what fresh meat they could, and the rest they dried and preserved.</p>
<p class="p7">It was at this time, according to tradition, that people first began to dry meat.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher having finished this discourse, identified the Jātaka by the following verses, after Fully Awakening:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Foolish Dog.&rdquo;</span><a id="a5818"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while living in Jetavana, about a dog that used to be fed in the resting hall by the Ambala tower.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">It is said that from a puppy this dog had been kept there and fed by some water-carriers. In course of time it grew up there to be a big dog. Once a </span><span class="t18">[2.171] </span><span class="t30">villager happened to see him; and he bought him from the water-carriers for an upper garment and a rupee; then, fastening him to a chain, led the dog away. The dog was led away, unresisting, making no sound, and followed and followed the new master, eating whatever was offered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fond of me, no doubt,&rdquo; thought the man; and let him free from the chain. No sooner did the dog find himself free, than off he went, and never stopped until he came back to the place he started from.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Seeing him, the monks guessed what had happened; and in the evening, when they were gathered in the Dhamma Hall, they began talking about it. &ldquo;Friend, here&rsquo;s the dog back again in our resting hall! How clever he must have been, to get rid of his chain! No sooner free, than back he ran!&rdquo; The Teacher, entering, asked what they were all talking about as they sat together. They told him. He rejoined, &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time our dog was clever at getting rid of his chain; he was just the same before.&rdquo; And he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a rich family of the kingdom of Kāsi; and when he grew up, he set up a house of his own. There was a man in Benares who had a dog which had been fed on rice till it grew fat. <span class="t18">{2.247}</span> And a certain villager who had come to Benares saw the dog; and to the owner he gave a fine garment and a piece of money for the dog, which he led off bound by a strap. Arrived at the outskirts of a forest, he entered a hut, tied up the dog, and lay down to sleep. At that moment the Bodhisatta entered the forest on some errand, and beheld the dog made fast by a thong; whereat he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5819"></a><a id="a5820"></a><a id="a5821"></a><a id="a5822"></a><span class="t12">1. Bālo vatāyaṁ sunakho yo varattaṁ na khādati,</span></p>

<p class="p23">On hearing this verse, the dog uttered the second:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5828"></a><a id="a5829"></a><a id="a5830"></a><a id="a5831"></a><span class="t12">2. Aṭṭhitaṁ me manasmiṁ me, atho me hadaye kataṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;I had a pupil once.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.172]</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told in the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On this occasion the monks said to Devadatta, &ldquo;Friend Devadatta, the Supreme Buddha is your teacher; of him you learned the Three Piṭakas and how to produce the four kinds of Absorption; you really should not act the enemy to your own teacher!&rdquo; Devadatta replied, &ldquo;Why, friends, Gotama the ascetic my teacher? Not a bit: was it not by my own power that I learned the Three Piṭakas, and produced the four Absorptions?&rdquo; He refused to acknowledge his teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks fell talking of this in the Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;Friend! Devadatta repudiates his teacher! He has become an enemy of the Supreme Buddha! And what a miserable fate has befallen him!&rdquo; In came the Teacher, and enquired what they were all talking of together. They told him. &ldquo;Ah, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is not the first time that Devadatta has repudiated his teacher, and shown himself my enemy, and come to a miserable end. It was just the same before.&rdquo; And then he told the following story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5846"></a><a id="a5847"></a><a id="a5848"></a><a id="a5849"></a><a id="a5850"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a musician&rsquo;s family. His name was teacher Guttila. When he grew up, he mastered all the branches of music, and under the name of Guttila Gandhabba he became the chief of his kind in all Jambudīpa. He married no wife, but maintained his blind parents.<a id="a5851"></a><a href="notes.html#a15243"><span class="t9">{482}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">At that time certain traders of Benares made a journey to Ujjeni for trade. A holiday was proclaimed; they all clubbed together; they procured scents and perfumes and ointments, and all manner of foods and meats. &ldquo;Pay the hire,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;and fetch a musician!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">It happened that at the time a certain Mūsila <span class="t18">{2.249}</span> was the chief musician in Ujjeni. Him they sent for, and made him their musician. Mūsila was a player on the lute; and he tuned his lute up to the highest key, to play upon. But they knew the playing of Guttila Gandhabba, and his music seemed to them like scratching on a mat. So not one of them showed pleasure. When Mūsila saw that they expressed no pleasure, he said to himself, &ldquo;Too sharp, I suppose,&rdquo; and tuning his lute down to the middle tone, he played it so. Still they sat indifferent. Then he thought: &ldquo;I suppose they know nothing about it,&rdquo; and making as though he <span class="t18">[2.173] </span>too were ignorant, he played with the strings all loose. As before, they made no sign. Then Mūsila asked them, &ldquo;Good merchants, why do you not like my playing?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What! Are you playing?&rdquo; cried they. &ldquo;We imagined that you must be tuning up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why, do you know any better musician,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;or are you too ignorant to like my playing?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Said the merchants, &ldquo;We have heard the music of Guttila Gandhabba, at Benares; and yours sounds like women crooning to sooth their babies.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Here, take your money back,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it. Only when you go to Benares, please take me with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">They agreed, and took him back to Benares with them; they pointed out the dwelling of Guttila, and departed every man to his own house.</p>
<p class="p7">Mūsila entered the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s dwelling; he saw his beautiful lute where it stood, tied up: he took it down, and played upon it. At this the old parents, who could not see him because they were blind, <span class="t18">{2.250}</span> cried out: &ldquo;The mice are gnawing at the lute! Shoo! Shoo! The rats are biting the lute to pieces!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">At once Mūsila put down the lute, and greeted the old folks. &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; asked they. He replied, &ldquo;I come from Ujjeni to learn at the feet of the teacher.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said they. He asked where the teacher was.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;He is out, father; but he will be back today,&rdquo; came the answer. Mūsila sat down and waited until he came; then after some friendly words, he told his errand. Now the Bodhisatta was skilled in divining from the lineaments of the body. He perceived that this was not a good man; so he refused. &ldquo;Go, my son, this art is not for you.&rdquo; Mūsila clasped the feet of the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s parents, to help his suit, and prayed them, &ldquo;Make him teach me!&rdquo; Again and again his parents besought the Bodhisatta to do so; until he could not stand it any longer, and did as he was asked. And Mūsila went along with the Bodhisatta into the king&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Who is this, master?&rdquo; asked the king, on seeing him. &ldquo;A pupil of mine, great king!&rdquo; was the reply. By and by he got the ear of the king.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the Bodhisatta did not stint his knowledge, but taught his pupil everything which he knew himself. This done, he said: &ldquo;Your knowledge is now perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5852"></a>Thought Mūsila, &ldquo;I have now mastered my art. This city of Benares is the chief city in all Jambudīpa. My teacher is old; here therefore I must <span class="t18">[2.174] </span>stay.&rdquo; So he said to his teacher, &ldquo;Sir, I would serve the king.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good, my son,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I will tell the king of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">He came before the king, and said: &ldquo;My pupil wishes to serve your highness. Fix what his fee shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king answered, &ldquo;His fee shall be half of yours.&rdquo; And he came and told it to Mūsila. Mūsila said: &ldquo;If I receive the same as you, I will serve; but if not, then I will not serve him.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.251} </span>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;Say, do I not know all that you know?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, you do.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then why does he offer me the half?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta informed the king what had passed. The king said: &ldquo;If he is as perfect in his art as you, he shall receive the same as you do.&rdquo; This saying of the king the Bodhisatta told to his pupil. The pupil consented to the bargain; and the king, being informed of this, replied, &ldquo;Very good. What day will you compete together?&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it the seventh day from this, O king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king sent for Mūsila. &ldquo;I understand that you are ready to try issue with your master?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, your Majesty,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p class="p7">The king would have dissuaded him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there should never be rivalry between master and pupil.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Hold, O king!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;yes, let there be a meeting between me and my teacher on the seventh day; we shall know which of us is master of his art.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So the king agreed; and he sent the drum beating round the city with this notice, &ldquo;Oyez! On the seventh day Guttila the teacher, and Mūsila the pupil, will meet at the door of the royal palace, to show their skill. Let the people assemble from the city, and see their skill!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5853"></a>The Bodhisatta thought within himself, &ldquo;This Mūsila is young and fresh, I am old and my strength is gone. What an old man does will not prosper. If my pupil is beaten,<a id="a5854"></a><a href="notes.html#a15245"><span class="t9">{483}</span></a> there is no great credit in that. If he beats me, death in the woods is better than the shame which will be my portion.&rdquo; So to the woods he went, but he kept returning through fear of death and going back to the wood through fear of shame. And in this way six days passed by. The grass died as he walked, and his feet wore away a path.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time, Sakka&rsquo;s throne became hot. Sakka meditated, and perceived what had happened. &ldquo;Guttila Gandhabba is suffering much sorrow in the forest by reason of his pupil. <span class="t18">{2.252}</span> I must help him!&rdquo; So he went in haste and stood before the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why have you taken to the woods?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the other. <span class="t18">[2.175] </span>&ldquo;I am Sakka.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5855"></a>Then said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;I was in fear of being worsted by my pupil, O King of the Devas; and therefore did I flee to the woods.&rdquo; And he repeated the first verse:<a id="a5856"></a><a href="notes.html#a15247"><span class="t9">{484}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5857"></a><a id="a5858"></a><a id="a5859"></a><a id="a5860"></a><span class="t12">1. Sattatantiṁ sumadhuraṁ rāmaṇeyyaṁ avācayiṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5861"></a><a id="a5862"></a><span class="t12">So maṁ raṅgamhi avheti, saraṇaṁ me hohi Kosiyā ti!</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a5863"></a><a id="a5864"></a><span class="t4">The seven stringed and sonorous lute he sounded agreeably, he addresses me from the stage, please be my refuge, Kosiya!</span></p>
<p class="p23">&ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; said Sakka, &ldquo;I am your defence and refuge,&rdquo; and he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5865"></a><a id="a5866"></a><a id="a5867"></a><span class="t12">2. Ahaṁ taṁ saraṇaṁ samma, aham-ācar</span><span class="t46">i</span><span class="t12">yapūjako,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5868"></a><span class="t12">Na taṁ jayissati sisso, sissam-ācar</span><span class="t46">i</span><span class="t12">ya jessasī ti!</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a5869"></a><a id="a5870"></a><a id="a5871"></a><span class="t4">I am a refuge to you, friend, I am one who worships teachers, the pupil won&rsquo;t conquer you, teacher, the pupil will be defeated!</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a5872"></a>&ldquo;As you play, you shall break one of the strings of your lute, and play upon six; and the music shall be as good as before. Mūsila too shall break a string, and he shall not be able to make music with his lute; then shall he be defeated. And when you see that he is defeated, you shall break the second string of your lute, and the third, even unto the seventh, and you shall go on playing with nothing but the body; and from the ends of the broken strings the sound shall go forth, and fill all the land of Benares for a space of twelve leagues.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.253}</span></p>
<p class="p7">With these words he gave the Bodhisatta three playing-dice, and went on, &ldquo;When the sound of the lute has filled all the city, you must throw one of these dice into the air; and three hundred Accharā shall descend and dance before you. While they dance throw up the second, and three hundred shall dance in front of your lute; then the third, and then three hundred more shall come down and dance within the arena. I too will come with them; go on, and fear not!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5873"></a>In the morning the Bodhisatta returned home. At the palace door a pavilion was set up, and a throne was set apart for the king. He came down from the palace, and took his seat upon the divan in the decorated pavilion. All around him were thousands of slaves, women beauteously apparelled, courtiers, brahmins, citizens. All the people of the town had come together. In the courtyard they were fixing the seats circle on circle, tier above tier. The Bodhisatta, washed and anointed, had eaten of all manner of finest meats; and lute in hand he sat waiting in his appointed place. Sakka was there, invisible, poised in the air, surrounded <span class="t18">[2.176] </span>by a great company. However, the Bodhisatta saw him. Mūsila too was there, and sat in his own seat. All around was a great concourse of people.</p>
<p class="p7">First the two played each the same piece. When they played, both the same, the multitude was delighted, and gave abundant applause. Sakka spoke to the Bodhisatta, from his place in the air, &ldquo;Break one of the strings!&rdquo; said he. Then the Bodhisatta broke the bee-string; and the string, though broken, gave out a sound from its broken end; it seemed like music divine. Mūsila too broke a string; but after that no sound came out of it. His teacher broke the second, and so on to the seventh string: he played upon the body alone, and the sound continued, and filled the town: the multitude in thousands waved and waved their kerchiefs in the air, in thousands they shouted applause. <span class="t18">{2.254}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta threw up one of the dice into the air, and three hundred Accharā descended and began to dance. And when he had thrown the second and third in the same manner, there were nine hundred Accharā dancing as Sakka had said. Then the king made a sign to the multitude; up rose the multitude, and cried, &ldquo;You made a great mistake in matching yourself against your teacher! You know not your measure!&rdquo; Thus they cried out against Mūsila; and with stories and staves, and anything that came to hand, they beat and bruised him to death, and seizing him by the feet, they cast him upon a dustheap.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5874"></a>The king in his delight showered gifts upon the Bodhisatta, and so did they of the city. Sakka likewise spake pleasantly to him, and said: &ldquo;Wise sir, I will soon send my charioteer Mātali with a carriage drawn by a thousand thoroughbreds; and you shall mount upon my divine carriage, drawn by a thousand steeds, and travel to heaven,&rdquo; and he departed.</p>
<p class="p7">When Sakka was returned, and sat upon his throne, made all of a precious stone, the Devadhītā asked him, &ldquo;Where have you been, O king?&rdquo; Sakka told them in full all that had happened, and praised the virtues and good parts of the Bodhisatta. Then said the Devadhītā, &ldquo;O king, we long to look upon this teacher; fetch him here!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Sakka summoned Mātali. &ldquo;The Devaccharā,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;desire to look upon Guttila Gandhabba. Go, seat him in my divine carriage, and bring him here.&rdquo; The charioteer went and brought the Bodhisatta. Sakka gave him a friendly greeting. &ldquo;The Devakaññā,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;wish to hear your music, teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5875"></a>&ldquo;We musicians, O great king,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;live by practice of our art. For a recompense I will play.&rdquo; &ldquo;Play on, and I will recompense you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I care for no other recompense but this. Let these Devadhītā tell me what acts of virtue brought them here; then will I play.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.255}</span> <span class="t18">[2.177] </span>Then said the Devadhītā, &ldquo;Gladly will we tell you of the virtues that we have practised; but first do you play to us, teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">For the space of a week the Bodhisatta played to them, and his music surpassed the music of heaven. On the seventh day he asked the Devadhītā of their virtuous lives, beginning from the first. One of them, in the time of the Buddha Kassapa, had given an upper garment to a certain monk; and having renewed existence as an attendant of Sakka, had become chief among the Devakaññā, with a retinue of a thousand Accharā: of her the Bodhisatta asked, &ldquo;What did you do in a previous existence, that has brought you here?&rdquo; The manner of his question and the gift she had given have been told in the Vimāna story,<a id="a5876"></a><a href="notes.html#a15250"><span class="t9">{485}</span></a> they spoke as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5877"></a><span class="t12">&ldquo;O brilliant Devatā, like morning star,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5878"></a><span class="t12">Shedding your light of beauty near and far,</span><a id="a5879"></a><a href="notes.html#a15253"><span class="t19">{486}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whence springs this beauty? Whence this happiness?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whence all the blessings that the heart can bless?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I ask you, Devī excellent in might,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whence comes this all-pervading wondrous light?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When you were mortal woman, what did you</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To gain the glory that surrounds you now?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ldquo;Chief among men and chief of women she</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who gives an upper robe in generosity.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She that gives pleasant things is sure to win</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A home divine and fair to enter in.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Behold this habitation, how divine!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As fruit of my good deeds this home is mine</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A thousand </span><span class="t12">Accharā </span><span class="t12">stand at my call;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fair nymphs &ndash; and I the fairest of them all.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And therefore am I excellent in might;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5880"></a><span class="t12">Hence comes this all-pervading wondrous light!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{2.256}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Another had given flowers for worship to a monk who craved an alms. Another had been asked for a scented wreath of five sprays for the shrine, and gave it. Another had given sweet fruits. Another had given fine essences. Another had given a scented five-spray to the shrine of Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers. Another had heard the discourse of monks or nuns in wayfaring, or such as had taken up their abode in the house of some family. Another had stood in the water, and given water to a monk who had eaten his meal on a boat. Another living in the world had done her duty by mother-in-law and father-in-law, never losing her temper. Another had divided even the share that she received, and so did eat, and was virtuous. Another, who had been a slave in some household, without anger and without pride had given away a share of her own portion, and had been born again as an attendant upon the King of <span class="t18">[2.178] </span>the Gods. So also all those who are written in the story of Guttilavimāna, thirty and seven Devadhītā, were asked by the Bodhisatta what each had done to come there, and they too told what they had done in the same way by verses.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5881"></a>On hearing all this, the Bodhisatta exclaimed, &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis good for me, in truth, truly &rsquo;tis very good for me, that I came here, and heard by how very small a merit great glory has been attained. Henceforward, when I return to the world of men, I will give all manner of gifts, and perform good deeds.&rdquo; And he uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5882"></a><span class="t12">&ldquo;O happy dawn! O happy must I be!</span><a id="a5883"></a><a href="notes.html#a15255"><span class="t19">{487}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O happy pilgrimage, whereby I see</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">These Devatās, like </span><span class="t12">Accharās</span><span class="t12">, </span><span class="t18">{2.257}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And hear their sweet discourse! Henceforth I swear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Full of sweet peace, and generosity,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of temperance, and truth my life shall be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Till I come there where no more sorrows are.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then after seven days had passed, the king of heaven laid his commands upon Mātali the charioteer, and he seated Guttila in the chariot and sent him to Benares. And when he came to Benares, he told the people what he had seen with his own eyes in heaven. From that time the people resolved to do good deeds with all their might.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;In those days Devadatta was Mūsila, Anuruddha was Sakka, Ānanda was the king, and I was Guttila Gandhabba.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;What he sees.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a turntail vagrant who wandered about the country.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">It is said that this man could not find any one to argue with him in all Jambudīpa; till he came to Sāvatthi, and asked whether any one could dispute with him. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he was told, &ldquo;the Supreme Buddha;&rdquo; hearing which, he and a multitude with him repaired to Jetavana, and put a question to the Teacher, </span><span class="t18">[2.179] </span><span class="t30">while he was discoursing in the midst of the four kinds of disciples. The Teacher answered his question, and then put one to him in return. This the man failed to answer, got up, and turned tail. The crowd sitting round exclaimed, &ldquo;One word, sir, vanquished the itinerant!&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Yes, monks, and just as I have vanquished him now with one word, so I did before.&rdquo; Then he told a story of olden days.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a brahmin in the kingdom of Kāsi. He grew up, and mastered his passions; and embracing the ascetic life, <span class="t18">{2.258}</span> he dwelt a long time in the Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">He came down from the highlands, and took up his abode near a considerable town, in a hut of leaves built beside a bend of the river Ganges. A certain pilgrim, who found no one that could answer him throughout all Jambudīpa, came to that town. &ldquo;Is there anyone,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;who can argue with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they said, and told him the power of the Bodhisatta. So, followed by a great multitude, he made his way to the place where the Bodhisatta dwelt, and after greeting him, took a seat.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Will you drink,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;of the Ganges water, infused with wild wood odours?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The pilgrim tried to catch him in his words. &ldquo;What is Ganges? Ganges may be sand, Ganges may be water, Ganges may be the near bank, Ganges may be the far bank!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Said the Bodhisatta to the pilgrim, &ldquo;Besides the sand, the water, the here and the further bank, what other Ganges can you have?&rdquo; The pilgrim had no answer for this; he rose up, and went away. When he had gone the Bodhisatta spake these verses by way of discourse to the assembled multitude:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present some brahmins learn from the Buddha, and then think they know all that he knows, but when he teaches a particularly deep discourse they cannot understand it. The Buddha tells a story of how in the past he had faced the same slight, and had asked questions of the pupils which they couldn&rsquo;t answer.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the teacher (ācariya),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Time all consumes.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.180]</span><span class="t30"> This is a story told by the Teacher while he stayed near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhagavana Park, in connection with the Discourse on the Succession of Causes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At that time, it is said, five hundred brahmins who had mastered the three Vedas, having embraced this dispensation, studied the Three Piṭakas. These learned, they became intoxicated with pride, thinking to themselves, &ldquo;The Supreme Buddha knows just the Three Piṭakas, and we know them too. So what is the difference between us?&rdquo; They discontinued their waiting upon the Buddha, and went about with an equal following of their own.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day the Teacher, when these men were seated before him, repeated the Discourse on the Succession of Causes,</span><a id="a5917"></a><a href="notes.html#a15257"><span class="t9">{488}</span></a><span class="t30"> and adorned it with the eight grounds. They did not understand a word. The thought came into their mind, &ldquo;Here we have been believing that there were none so wise as we, and of this we understand nothing. There is none so wise as the Buddhas: O the excellence of the Buddhas!&rdquo; After this they were humbled, as quiet as serpents with their fangs extracted.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5918"></a><span class="t30">When the Teacher had stayed as long as he wished in Ukkaṭṭhā, he departed to Vesāli; and at Gotama&rsquo;s shrine he repeated the Discourse on the Gotamaka Shrine.</span><a id="a5919"></a><a href="notes.html#a15259"><span class="t9">{489}</span></a><span class="t30"> There was a quaking of a thousand worlds! Hearing this, these monks became saints.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5920"></a><span class="t30">But however, after the Teacher had finished repeating the Discourse on the Succession of Causes, during his visit to Ukkaṭṭhā </span><span class="t18">{2.260}</span><span class="t30"> the monks discussed the whole affair in the Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;How great is the power of the Buddhas, friend! Why, these brahmin mendicants, who used to be so drunk with pride, have been humbled by the Discourse on the Succession of Causes!&rdquo; The Teacher entered and asked what their talk was about. They told him. He said: &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time that I have humbled these men, who used to carry their heads so high with pride; I did the same before.&rdquo; And then he told them a tale of the olden time.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a brahmin; who, when he grew up, and mastered the Three Vedas, became a far-famed teacher, and instructed five hundred pupils in sacred verses. These five hundred, having given their best energy to their work, and perfected their learning, said within themselves, &ldquo;We know as much as our teacher: there is no difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Proud and stubborn, they would not come before their teacher&rsquo;s face, nor do their round of duty.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, they saw their master seated beneath a jujube tree; and desiring to mock him, they tapped upon the tree with their fingers. &ldquo;A worthless tree!&rdquo; said they. <span class="t18">[2.181]</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta observed that they were mocking him. &ldquo;My pupils,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I will ask you a question.&rdquo; They were delighted. &ldquo;Speak on,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we will answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Their teacher asked the question by repeating the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5921"></a><a id="a5922"></a><a id="a5923"></a><a id="a5924"></a><span class="t12">1. Kālo ghasati bhūtāni sabbāneva sahattanā,</span></p>

<p class="p23"><a id="a5929"></a>The youths listened to the problem; but not one amongst them could answer it. Then said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Do not imagine that this question is in the Three Vedas. You imagine that you know all that I know, and so you act like the jujube tree.<a id="a5930"></a><a href="notes.html#a15261"><span class="t9">{490}</span></a> You don&rsquo;t know that I know a great deal which is unknown to you. Leave me now: I give you seven days &ndash; think over this question for so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So they made salutation, and departed each to his own house. There for a week they pondered, yet they could make neither head nor tail of the problem. On the seventh day, they came to their teacher, and greeted him, sitting down.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, you of auspicious speech, have you solved the question?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;No, we have not,&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p class="p7">Again the Bodhisatta spoke in reproof, uttering the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5931"></a><a id="a5932"></a><a id="a5933"></a><span class="t12">2. Bahūni narasīsāni lomasāni brahāni ca,</span></p>

<p class="p23">&ldquo;Fools are you,&rdquo; he went on, rebuking the youths, &ldquo;you have ears with holes in them, but not wisdom,&rdquo; and he solved the problem. <span class="t18">{2.262}</span> They listened. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;great are our teachers!&rdquo; and they craved his pardon, and quenching their pride they waited upon the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time these monks were the five hundred pupils; and I myself was their teacher.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the ascetic Nāthaputta blames the Buddha for eating meat. The Buddha tells a story of a past life in which he has been similarly blamed, and how he had said that it is not the one who eats, but the one who kills who is to blame for the meat.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">It is said that this man, after he had fled to the refuge, offered hospitality and then gave food with meat in it. The naked ascetics on hearing this were angry and displeased; they wanted to do the Tathāgata a mischief, &ldquo;The ascetic Gotama,&rdquo; sneered they, &ldquo;with his eyes open, eats meat prepared on purpose for him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5945"></a><span class="t30">The monks discussed this matter in their Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Friend, Nāthaputta the naked ascetic</span><a id="a5946"></a><a href="notes.html#a15263"><span class="t9">{491}</span></a><span class="t30"> goes about sneering, because, he says, &lsquo;The ascetic Gotama eats meat prepared on purpose for him, with his eyes open.&rsquo; &rdquo; Hearing this, the Teacher rejoined, &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that Nāthaputta has been sneering at me for eating meat which was got ready for me on purpose; he did just so in former times.&rdquo; And he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a brahmin. When he came of age he embraced the ascetic life.</p>
<p class="p7">He came down from the Himālayas to get salt and seasoning, and next day walked the city, begging alms. A certain wealthy man designed to annoy the ascetic. So he brought him to his dwelling, and pointed out a seat, and then served him with fish.</p>
<p class="p7">After the meal, the man sat on one side, and said: &ldquo;This food was prepared on purpose for you, by killing living creatures. Not upon my head is this wrong, but upon yours!&rdquo; And he repeated the first verse:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks were talking about it in the Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;Friend, did you see how Lāḷudāyi curled his lip in scorn of the two chief disciples?&rdquo; On hearing which the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, in olden days, as now, Lāḷudāyi had no other answer but a curl of the lip.&rdquo; Then he told them a story. </span><span class="t18">{2.264}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when king Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was his adviser in things spiritual and temporal. Now the king had a son, Pādañjali by name, an idle lazy loafer. By and by the king died. His obsequies over, the courtiers talked of consecrating his son Pādañjali to be king. But the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis a lazy fellow, an idle loafer &ndash; shall we take and consecrate him king?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The courtiers held a trial. They sat the youth down before them, and made a wrong decision. They adjudged something to the wrong owner, and asked him, &ldquo;Young sir, do we decide rightly?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The lad curled his lip. &ldquo;He is a wise lad, I think,&rdquo; thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;he must know that we have decided wrongly,&rdquo; and he recited the first verse:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Four monks, approaching the Tathāgata, asked him to explain the means by which Absorption may be induced. This he explained. This done, they dispersed to the several places where they spent their nights and days. One of them, having learned the Six Sense Spheres, became a saint; another did so after learning the Five Elements of Being, the third after learning the Four Principal Elements, the fourth after learning the Eighteen Constituents of Being. Each of them recounted to the Teacher the particular excellence which he had attained. A thought came into the mind of one of them; and he asked the Teacher, &ldquo;There is only one Nibbāna for all these modes of meditation; how is it that all of them lead to becoming an Arahat?&rdquo; Then the Teacher asked, &ldquo;Is not this like the people who saw the Flame of the Forest?&rdquo; As they requested him to tell them about it, he repeated a tale of bygone days.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5998"></a>In the past Brahmadatta the king of Benares had four sons. One day they sent for the charioteer, and said to him, &ldquo;We want to see a Flame of the Forest; show us one!&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.185]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very well, I will,&rdquo; the charioteer replied. But he did not show it to them all together. He took the eldest at once to the forest in the chariot, and showed him the tree at the time when the buds were just sprouting from the stem. To the second he showed it when the leaves were green, to the third at the time of blossoming, and to the fourth when it was bearing fruit.</p>
<p class="p7">After this it happened that the four brothers were sitting together, and someone asked, &ldquo;What sort of a tree is the Flame of the Forest?&rdquo; Then the first brother answered,</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5999"></a>&ldquo;Like a burnt stump!&rdquo; And the second cried, &ldquo;Like a banyan tree!&rdquo; And the third, &ldquo;Like a piece of meat!&rdquo;<a id="a6000"></a><a href="notes.html#a15271"><span class="t9">{494}</span></a> And the fourth said: &ldquo;Like the acacia!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">They were vexed at each other&rsquo;s answers, and ran to find their father. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; they asked, &ldquo;what sort of a tree is the Flame of the Forest?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What did you say to that?&rdquo; he asked. They told him the manner of their answers.</p>
<p class="p7">Said the king, &ldquo;All four of you have seen the tree. Only when the charioteer showed you the tree, you did not ask him &lsquo;What is the tree like at such a time?&rsquo; <span class="t18">{2.266}</span> or &lsquo;at such another time?&rsquo; You made no distinctions, and that is the reason of your mistake.&rdquo; And he repeated the first verse:</p>

<p class="p23">The Teacher, having explained the matter, then addressed the monks, &ldquo;Now as the four brothers, because they did not make a distinction and ask, fell in doubt about the tree, so you have fallen in doubt about what is right,&rdquo; and, becoming Perfectly Awakened, he uttered the second verse:</p>

<p class="p7">In the past, in the reign of Brahmadatta king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a landowner&rsquo;s family, and gained a living by selling corn. Another man, a snake-charmer, had trained a monkey, made him swallow an antidote, and making a snake play with the monkey he gained his livelihood in this way.</p>
<p class="p7">A merrymaking had been proclaimed; this man wished to make merry at the feast, and he entrusted the monkey to this merchant, bidding him not neglect it. Seven days after he came to the merchant, and asked for his monkey. The monkey heard his master&rsquo;s voice, and came out quickly from the grain shop. At once the man beat him over the back with a piece of bamboo; then he took him off to the woods, tied him up and fell asleep. So soon as the monkey saw that he was asleep, he loosed his bonds, scampered off and climbed a mango tree. He ate a mango, and dropped the stone upon the snake-charmer&rsquo;s head. The man awoke, and looked up: there was the monkey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wheedle him!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and when he comes down from the tree, I&rsquo;ll catch him!&rdquo; So to wheedle him, he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6020"></a><a id="a6021"></a><span class="t12">1. Ekaputtako bhavissasi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6022"></a><span class="t12">Tvañ-ca no hessasi issaro kule,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Oroha dumasmā Sālaka,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6023"></a><a id="a6024"></a><span class="t12">Ehi dāni gharakaṁ vajemase ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6025"></a><span class="t4">You&rsquo;ll be my only child, you will be master in our family, </span><span class="t18">{2.268} </span><a id="a6026"></a><a id="a6027"></a><a id="a6028"></a><span class="t4">descend from the tree, Sālaka, come now we should go to our home. </span><span class="t18">[2.187]</span></p>
<p class="p23">The monkey listened, and repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6029"></a><a id="a6030"></a><span class="t12">2. Nanu maṁ suhadayo ti maññasi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6031"></a><span class="t12">Yañ-ca maṁ hanasi veḷuyaṭṭhiyā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6032"></a><a id="a6033"></a><span class="t12">Pakkambavane ramāmase,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gaccha tvaṁ gharakaṁ yathāsukhan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6034"></a><a id="a6035"></a><a id="a6036"></a><a id="a6037"></a><span class="t4">My heart is surely good, you think, but you beat me with bamboo sticks, we enjoy this ripe mango wood, you go to your home as you like.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Up he arose, and was soon lost in the wood; while the snake-charmer returned to his house grieving.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Our novice was the monkey. The elder was the snake-charmer, and I myself was the corn merchant.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is being very deceitful, and it sets the monks to talking about him. The Buddha explains that in a previous life he had been a monkey, had dressed as an ascetic to try and gain a warm fire, but was discovered and chased away.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a6043"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the (ascetic) father (pitā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Rāhula = the son (putta),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the deceiving monk = the monkey (makkaṭa).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a6044"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Deceit, Appearances, Animals.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;A holy sage.&rdquo;</span><a id="a6045"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while living at Jetavana, about a deceitful monk.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Saṅgha found out his deceit. In the Dhamma Hall they were talking it over, &ldquo;Friend, monk So-and-so, after embracing the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation, which leads to safety, still practises deceit.&rdquo; The Teacher on coming in </span><span class="t18">{2.269}</span><span class="t30"> asked what they were discussing together. They told him. Said he, &ldquo;Monks, it is not the only time this monk has been a deceitful person; for a deceitful person he was before, when he shammed simply for the sake of warming himself at the fire.&rdquo; Then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a brahmin family. When he grew up, and his own son was of an age to run about, his wife died; he took the child on his hip, and departed into the Himālayas, where he became an ascetic, and brought up his son to the same life, dwelling in a hut of leaves.</p>
<p class="p7">It was the rainy season, and the heaven poured down its floods incessantly: a monkey wandered about, tormented with the cold, chattering and rattling his teeth. The Bodhisatta fetched a great log, lit a fire, and lay down upon his pallet. His son sat by him, and massaged his feet. <span class="t18">[2.188]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now the monkey had found a dress belonging to some dead ascetic. He clad himself in the upper and lower garment, throwing the skin over one shoulder; he took the pole and waterpot, and in this sage&rsquo;s dress he came to the leaf-hut for the fire: and there he stood, in his borrowed plumes.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6046"></a>The lad caught sight of him, and cried out to his father, &ldquo;See, father &ndash; there is an ascetic, trembling with cold! Call him here; he shall warm himself.&rdquo; Thus addressing his father, he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6047"></a><a id="a6048"></a><a id="a6049"></a><span class="t12">1. Ayaṁ isī upasamasaṁyame rato</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6050"></a><a id="a6051"></a><a id="a6052"></a><a id="a6053"></a><span class="t12">Sa tiṭṭhatī sisirabhayena aṭṭito,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6054"></a><span class="t12">Handā ayaṁ pavisatumaṁ agārakaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6055"></a><span class="t12">Vinetu sītaṁ darathañ-ca kevalan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6056"></a><a id="a6057"></a><a id="a6058"></a><a id="a6059"></a><a id="a6060"></a><a id="a6061"></a><a id="a6062"></a><span class="t4">This seer, delighting in calm and restraint stands afflicted by the fear of winter, come now, please enter into this household, drive away all cold and anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="p23">The Bodhisatta listened to his son; he rose up, and looked; then he knew it was a monkey, and repeated the second verse: <span class="t18">{2.270}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6063"></a><span class="t12">2. Nāyaṁ isī upasamasaṁyame rato,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6064"></a><span class="t12">Kapī ayaṁ dumavarasākhagocaro,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6065"></a><a id="a6066"></a><span class="t12">So dūsako rosako cāpi jammo,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6067"></a><span class="t12">Sace vaje mam-pi dūseyyagāran-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6068"></a><a id="a6069"></a><a id="a6070"></a><a id="a6071"></a><a id="a6072"></a><span class="t4">This is no seer, delighting in calm and restraint, this is a monkey who ranges in tree branches. He is a spoiler, a provocateur, vulgar, if he comes inside he will surely spoil my home.</span></p>
<p class="p23">With these words, the Bodhisatta seized a firebrand, and scared away the monkey; and he leaped up, and whether he liked the wood or whether he didn&rsquo;t, he never returned to that place any more. The Bodhisatta cultivated the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and to the young ascetic he explained how to focus on the Meditation Object; and he too let the Super Knowledges and Attainments spring up within him. And both of them, without a break in their Absorption, became destined to the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Thus did the Teacher discourse by way of showing how this man was not then only, but always, a deceitful person. This ended, he declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths some reached the First Path, some the Second, and yet some the Third, &ldquo;The hypocritical monk was the monkey, Rāhula was the son, and I was the ascetic myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
