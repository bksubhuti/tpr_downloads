<p class="p7"><a id="a8790"></a><a id="a8791"></a><a id="a8792"></a><span class="t15">In the present an innocent courtier is thrown into prison, but later released and honoured by the king. The Buddha tells a story of how a man intrigued in the palace in Benares, was exiled and enticed a foreign king to attack his former country. The king of Benares, rather than cause the deaths of others, allowed himself to be captured, and the conqueror, seeing his virtue, relented and set him free. In this telling we have additional dialogue they exchanged.</span></p>

The incident that gave rise to the story has been given in full before.</span><a id="a8798"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15516"><span class="t9">{608}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8799"></a><a id="a8800"></a><span class="t34">This tale the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a courtier of the king of Kosala. This man was very useful to the king, we are told, and did everything that had to be done. Because he was very useful, the king did him great honour. The others were jealous, and concocted a slander, and calumniated him. The king believed their saying, and without enquiring into his guilt, bound him in chains, though virtuous and innocent, and cast him into prison. There he dwelt all alone; but, by reason of his virtue, he had peace of mind, and with mind at peace he understood the conditions of existence, and attained the fruition of the First Path. By and by the king found that he was guiltless, and broke his chains and gave him honour more than before.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The man wished to pay his respects to the Teacher; and taking flowers and perfumes, he went to the monastery, and did reverence to the Tathāgata, and sat respectfully aside. The Teacher talked graciously with him. &ldquo;We have heard that ill fortune befell you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Yes, sir, but I made my ill fortune into good; and as I sat in prison, I produced the fruition of the First Path.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7">Here too the Bodhisatta became king in Benares. The wicked councillor called in the king of Kosala and got him to seize upon the kingdom of Kāsi, and to throw the Bodhisatta into prison.<a id="a8801"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15518"><span class="t9">{609}</span></a> The king of Benares developed Absorption and sat cross-legged in the air. A fierce heat sprang up in the body of the marauding king, and he drew near to the king of Benares and repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Stripped of all the joys of life,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Jewelled earrings, horse and car,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Robbed of child and loving wife,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nought your pleasure seems to mar.&rdquo; </span><a id="a8802"></a><span class="t18">{3.154}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing him the Bodhisatta recited these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Pleasures soon make haste to leave us,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pleasures soon must all forego,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sorrow has no power to grieve us,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Joy itself soon turns to woe.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Moons with new-born orb appearing</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wax awhile, to wane and die,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Suns with warmth all nature cheering,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Haste to set in yonder sky.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Change is this world&rsquo;s law I see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sorrow has no pangs for me.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.103]</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a8803"></a>Thus now did the Great Being expound the Dhamma to the usurper king, and bringing his conduct to the test, repeated these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;The idle sensual layman I detest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The false ascetic is a rogue confessed.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A bad king will a case unheard decide;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wrath in the sage can ne&rsquo;er be justified.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. The warrior prince a well-weighed verdict gives,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of righteous judge the fame for ever lives.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.155}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king of Kosala having thus gained the forgiveness of the Bodhisatta and given him back his kingdom, departed to his own country.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his discourse, thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the king of Kosala, and I myself was the king of Benares.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present when a landholder loses his father he is inconsolable. The Buddha tells him a story of similar happenings in the past, and how a landowner&rsquo;s son had brought his father to see the truth by attempting to feed a dead ox.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a8812"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (the householder&rsquo;s son) Sujāta.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a8813"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Wisdom, Impermanence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Why haste to bring.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning a landowner who had lost his father. On the death of his father, they say, he went about lamenting, quite unable to shake off his grief. The Teacher perceived in the man a capacity to attain to the fruit of emancipation, and when he went his rounds in Sāvatthi for alms, accompanied by an attendant monk, he came to his house and sitting down on the seat prepared for him he bowed to his host, who was also seated, and said: &ldquo;Lay brother, are you grieving?&rdquo; and on his replying, &ldquo;Yes, venerable sir, I am,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Friend, sages of old hearkened to the words of wisdom, and when they lost a father, they did not grieve.&rdquo; And at the request of his host he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life in the house of a landowner. And they called him young Sujāta. When he was grown up, his grandfather died. Then his father from the day of the old man&rsquo;s death was filled with sorrow, and taking his bones from the place of cremation he erected an earth-mound in his pleasure-garden, and depositing the remains there, whenever he visited <span class="t18">[3.104] </span>the place, adorned the Stūpa with flowers and studiously lamented, neither bathing nor anointing himself nor eating. Neither did he attend to his business. The Bodhisatta, on observing this, thought: &ldquo;My father ever since the death of my grandfather goes about overwhelmed with grief. And no one, I am sure, except myself has power to console him. I will find a way to deliver him from his sorrow.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.156}</span></p>
<p class="p7">So seeing a dead ox lying outside the city, he brought grass and water and placing them before it said: &ldquo;Eat and drink, eat and drink.&rdquo; All that passed by on seeing this said: &ldquo;Friend Sujāta, are you mad? Do you offer grass and water to a dead ox?&rdquo; But he answered not a word.</p>
<p class="p7">So they went to his father and said: &ldquo;Your son has become mad. He is giving grass and water to a dead ox.&rdquo; On hearing this the landowner ceased to grieve for his father, and began to grieve for his son. And he went in haste and cried, &ldquo;My dear Sujāta, are you not in your sober senses? Why do you offer grass and water to the carcase of an ox?&rdquo; And hereupon he spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Why haste to bring your new-mown grass so sweet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And cry to lifeless beast, &lsquo;Arise and eat&rsquo;?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. No food may raise to life an ox that&rsquo;s dead,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your words are idle and of folly bred.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta uttered two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;I think this beast may come to life again,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Both head and tail and its four feet remain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. But of my grandfather head and limbs are gone:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No fool weeps o&rsquo;er his grave, but you alone.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.157}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the father of the Bodhisatta thought: &ldquo;My son is wise. He knows the right thing to be done both for this world and for the next. He did this to console me.&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;My dear and wise son Sujāta, it is known to me that all existing things are impermanent. Henceforth I will not grieve. Such a son as this must be every one that would remove a father&rsquo;s grief.&rdquo; And singing the praises of his son he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;As ghee-fed flame that blazes out amain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is quenched with water, so he quenched my pain.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. With sorrow&rsquo;s shaft my heart was wounded sore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He healed the wound and did my life restore.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. The barb extracted, full of peace and joy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I cease to grieve and hearken to my boy.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. Thus kindly souls wean mortals from their grief,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As wise Sujāta brought his sire relief.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">The Teacher having ended his discourse revealed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the landowner attained fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time I myself was Sujāta.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a8820"></a><span class="t15">In the present one king has a palace built, and has the architect blinded afterwards. The Buddha tells a story of how a wise man had warned a prince about his violent behaviour, but in his ambition when raised to king he put out the eyes of many other kings, and then suffered blindness himself in retribution.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a8821"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Cruelty, Retribution, Devas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Though you are now.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.105] </span><span class="t30">This story the Teacher, while living in the Bhesakalā grove near Suṁsumāragiri (Mount Crocodile) in the country of the Bhaggas, told concerning young prince Bodhi. This prince was the son of Udena, and at this time dwelt in Suṁsumāragiri. Now he summoned a very skilful artisan, and got him to build him a palace called Kokanada, and to make it unlike that of any other king. </span><span class="t18">{3.158}</span><span class="t30"> And afterwards he thought: &ldquo;This artisan may build a similar palace for some other king.&rdquo; And from a feeling of envy he plucked out his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This circumstance became known in the assembly of the monks. Then they raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, young prince Bodhi had the eyes of such and such an artisan put out. Surely he is a harsh, cruel, and violent man.&rdquo; The Teacher came and asked what was the topic the monks were debating as they sat together, and hearing what it was he said: &ldquo;Not only now, but formerly too such was his nature, and of old in like manner he put out the eyes of a thousand warriors and, after slaying them, he offered up their flesh as a sacrifice.&rdquo; And so saying he told them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta became a world-renowned teacher at Taxila, and youths of the warrior and brahmin castes came from all Jambudīpa, to be taught the arts by him. The son of the king of Benares too, prince Brahmadatta, was taught the three Vedas by him. Now he was by nature harsh, cruel, and violent. The Bodhisatta, by his power of divination knowing his character, said: &ldquo;My friend, you are harsh, cruel, and violent, and verily power that is attained by a man of violence is shortlived: when his power is gone from him, he is like a ship that is wrecked at sea. He reaches no sure haven. Therefore be not of such a character.&rdquo; And by way of admonition he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Though you are now with peace and plenty blessed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Such happy fate may short-lived prove to be:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should riches perish, be not sore distressed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like storm-tossed sailor wrecked far out at sea.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Each one shall fare according to his deed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And reap the harvest as he sows the seed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whether of goodly herb, or maybe noxious weed.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.159}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then he bade his teacher farewell and returned to Benares, and after exhibiting his proficiency in the arts to his father, he was established in the vice-royalty and on his father&rsquo;s death he succeeded to the kingdom. His family priest, Piṅgiya by name, was a harsh and cruel man. Being greedy of fame, he thought: &ldquo;What if I were to cause all the rulers of <span class="t18">[3.106] </span>Jambudīpa to be seized by this king, and if he should thus become sole monarch and I become sole priest?&rdquo; And he got the king to hearken to his words.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8822"></a>And the king marched forth with a great army and invested the city of a certain king and took him prisoner. And by similar means he gained the sovereignty of all Jambudīpa, and with a thousand kings in his train, he went to seize upon the kingdom of Taxila. The Bodhisatta repaired the walls of the city and made it impregnable to its enemies. And the king of Benares had a canopy set up over him and a curtain thrown round about him, at the foot of a big banyan tree on the banks of the Ganges. And having a couch spread for him, he took up his quarters there. Fighting in the plains of Jambudīpa he had taken captive a thousand kings, but failing in his attack on Taxila, he asked his priest, &ldquo;Teacher, though we have come here with a host of captive kings, we cannot take Taxila. What now are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Great king,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;put out the eyes of the thousand kings <span class="t18">{3.160}</span> and ripping open their bellies let us take their flesh and the five sweet substances and make an offering to the guardian deity of this banyan. And surrounding the tree with a rimmed circumference let us fill it with blood five inches deep. And so shall the victory soon be ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king readily assented and concealing mighty wrestlers behind the curtain, he summoned each king separately, and when the wrestlers had squeezed them in their arms till they had reduced them to a state of insensibility, he had their eyes put out, and after they were dead, he took the flesh and caused the carcases to be carried away by the Ganges. Then he made the offering, as described above, and had the drum beaten and went forth to battle. Then came a certain Yakkha from his watch-tower and tore out the right eye of the king. Severe pain set in, and maddened by the agony he suffered, he went and lay down at full length upon the couch prepared for him at the foot of the banyan tree. At this moment a vulture took a sharp-pointed bone, and perched on the top of the tree, in eating the flesh it let drop the bone, and the sharp point falling as with iron spikes on the king&rsquo;s left eye, destroyed that eye too. At this moment he recalled the words of the Bodhisatta and said: &ldquo;Our teacher when he said &lsquo;These mortals experience results corresponding to their deeds, even as fruit corresponds with the seed,&rsquo; spoke, I suppose, with all this before his mind&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo; And in his lamentation he addressed Piṅgiya in two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Ah! Now at last I recognize the truth</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The teacher taught me in my heedless youth:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wrong not, he cried, or else the evil deed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To thine own punishment may one day lead. </span><span class="t18">[3.107]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Beneath this tree&rsquo;s extended boughs and shade</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Libation due of sandal oil was made.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas here I slew a thousand kings, and lo!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The pangs they suffered then, I now must undergo.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.161}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus lamenting, he called to mind his queen-consort, and repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;O Ubbarī, my queen of swarthy hue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lithe as a shoot of fair moringa tree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That do your limbs with sandal oil bedew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How should I live, bereft of sight of you?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea death itself than this less grievous far would be!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">While he was still murmuring these words, he died and was born again in hell. The priest so ambitious of power could not save him, nor could he save himself by his own power, and as soon as he died, his army broke up and fled.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the young prince Bodhi was the marauding king, Devadatta was Piṅgiya, and I myself was the world-famed teacher.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present when a landholder loses his son he is inconsolable. The Buddha tells a story of a family of old who lost a son, but understanding the nature of the world, did not grieve. Later they were questioned and rewarded by Sakka.</span></p>

The introductory story is just the same as that of the man who lost both his wife and father. Here too the Teacher in the same way went to the man&rsquo;s house, and after saluting him as he was seated, asked him saying: &ldquo;Pray, sir, are you grieving?&rdquo; And on his replying, &ldquo;Yes, venerable sir, ever since my son&rsquo;s death I grieve,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Sir, verily that which is subject to dissolution is dissolved, and that which is subject to destruction is destroyed,</span><a id="a8831"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15520"><span class="t9">{610}</span></a><a id="a8832"></a><span class="t30"> and this happens not to one man only, nor in one village merely, but in countless spheres, and in the Three Worlds, there is no creature that is not subject to death, nor is there any existing thing that is capable of abiding in the same condition. All beings are subject to </span><span class="t18">[3.108] </span><span class="t30">death, and all compounds are subject to dissolution. But sages of old, when they lost a son, said, &lsquo;That which is subject to destruction is destroyed,&rsquo; and grieved not.&rdquo; And hereupon at the man&rsquo;s request he related a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin household, in a village outside the gates of Benares, and rearing a family he supported them by field labour. He had two children, a son and a daughter. When the son was grown up, the father brought a wife home for him from a family of equal rank with his own. Thus with a female slave they composed a household of six: the Bodhisatta and his wife, the son and daughter, the daughter-in-law and the female slave. They lived happily and affectionately together. The Bodhisatta thus admonished the other five, &ldquo;According as you have received, give alms, observe the fast days, keep the moral law, dwell on the thought of death, be mindful of your mortal state. For in the case of beings like ourselves, death is certain, life uncertain: all existing things are transitory and subject to decay. Therefore take heed to your ways day and night.&rdquo; They readily accepted his teaching and dwelt earnestly on the thought of death.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day the Bodhisatta went with his son to plough his field. <span class="t18">{3.163}</span> The son gathered together the rubbish and set fire to it. Not far from where he was, lived a snake in an anthill. The smoke hurt the snake&rsquo;s eyes. Coming out from his hole in a rage, it thought: &ldquo;This is all due to that fellow,&rdquo; and fastening upon him with its four teeth it bit him. The youth fell down dead. The Bodhisatta on seeing him fall, left his oxen and came to him, and finding that he was dead, he took him up and laid him at the foot of a certain tree, and covering him up with a cloak, he neither wept nor lamented. He said: &ldquo;That which is subject to dissolution is dissolved, and that which is subject to death is dead. All compound existences are transitory and liable to death.&rdquo; And recognizing the transitory nature of things he went on with his ploughing. Seeing a neighbour pass close by the field, he asked, &ldquo;Friend, are you going home?&rdquo; And on his answering, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Please then to go to our house and say to the mistress, &lsquo;You are not today as formerly to bring food for two, but to bring it for one only. And hitherto the female slave alone has brought the food, but today all four of you are to put on clean garments, and to come with perfumes and flowers in your hands.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, and went and spoke these very words to the brahmin&rsquo;s wife. She asked, &ldquo;By whom, sir, was this message given?&rdquo; &ldquo;By the brahmin, lady,&rdquo; he replied. <span class="t18">[3.109]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Then she understood that her son was dead. But she did not so much as tremble. Thus showing perfect self-control, and wearing white garments and with perfumes and flowers in her hand, she bade them bring food, and accompanied the other members of the family to the field. But not one of them either shed a tear or made lamentation. The Bodhisatta, still sitting in the shade where the youth lay, ate his food. And when his meal was finished, they all took up firewood and lifting the body on to the funeral pile, they made offerings of perfumes and flowers, and then set fire to it. But not a single tear was shed by any one. All were dwelling on the thought of death. Such was the efficacy of their virtue that the throne of Sakka manifested signs of heat. <span class="t18">{3.164}</span> Sakka said: &ldquo;Who, I wonder, is anxious to bring me down from my throne?&rdquo; And on reflection he discovered that the heat was due to the force of virtue existing in these people, and being highly pleased he said: &ldquo;I must go to them and utter a loud cry of exultation like the roaring of a lion, and immediately afterwards fill their dwelling place with the seven treasures.&rdquo; And going there in haste he stood by the side of the funeral pyre and said: &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;We are burning the body of a man, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;It is no man that you are burning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think you are roasting the flesh of some beast that you have slain.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not so, my lord,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;It is merely the body of a man that we are burning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then he said: &ldquo;It must have been some enemy.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;It is our own true son, and no enemy,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Then he could not have been dear as a son to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;He was very dear, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Then why do you not weep?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the Bodhisatta, to explain the reason why he did not weep, uttered the first verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Man quits his mortal frame, when joy in life is past,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">E&rsquo;en as a snake is wont its worn out slough to cast.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. No friend&rsquo;s lament can touch the ashes of the dead:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why should I grieve? He fares the way he had to tread.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.165}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka on hearing the words of the Bodhisatta, asked the brahmin&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;How, lady, did the dead man stand to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I sheltered him ten months in my womb, and suckled him at my breast, and directed the movements of his hands and feet, and he was my grown up son, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Granted, lady, that a father from the nature of a man may not weep, a mother&rsquo;s heart surely is tender. Why then do you not weep?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And to explain why she did not weep, she uttered a couple of verses: <span class="t18">[3.110]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Uncalled he hither came, unbidden soon to go;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">E&rsquo;en as he came, he went. What cause is here for woe?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. No friend&rsquo;s lament can touch the ashes of the dead:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why should I grieve? He fares the way he had to tread.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing the words of the brahmin&rsquo;s wife, Sakka asked the sister, &ldquo;Lady, what was the dead man to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;He was my brother, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Lady, sisters surely are loving towards their brothers. Why do you not weep?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">But she to explain the reason why she did not weep, repeated a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Though I should fast and weep, how would it profit me?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My kith and kin, alas, would more unhappy be. </span><span class="t18">{3.166}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. No friend&rsquo;s lament can touch the ashes of the dead:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why should I grieve? He fares the way he had to tread.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka on hearing the words of the sister, asked his wife, &ldquo;Lady, what was he to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;He was my husband, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Women surely, when a husband dies, as widows are helpless. Why do you not weep?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">But she to explain the reason why she did not weep, uttered two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;As children cry in vain to grasp the moon above,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So mortals idly mourn the loss of those they love.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. No friend&rsquo;s lament can touch the ashes of the dead:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why should I grieve? He fares the way he had to tread.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.167}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka on hearing the words of the wife, asked the handmaid, saying: &ldquo;Woman, what was he to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;He was my master, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;No doubt you must have been abused and beaten and oppressed by him and therefore, thinking he is happily dead, you weep not.&rdquo; &ldquo;Speak not so, my lord. This does not suit his case. My young master was full of long-suffering and love and pity for me, and was as a foster child to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Then why do you not weep?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And she to explain why she did not weep, uttered a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;A broken pot of earth, ah! who can piece again?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So too to mourn the dead is nought but labour vain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. No friend&rsquo;s lament can touch the ashes of the dead:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why should I grieve? He fares the way he had to tread.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.111]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka after hearing what they all had to say, was greatly pleased and said: &ldquo;You have carefully dwelt on the thought of death. Henceforth you are not to labour with your own hands. I am Sakka, king of heaven. I will create the seven treasures in countless abundance in your house. <span class="t18">{3.168}</span> You are to give alms, to keep the moral law, to observe the fast days, and to take heed to your ways.&rdquo; And thus admonishing them, he filled their house with countless wealth, and so parted from them.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher having finished his exposition of the Dhamma, declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the landowner attained the fruit of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time Khujjuttarā was the female slave, Uppalavaṇṇā the daughter, Rāhula the son, Khemā the mother, and I myself was the brahmin.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;While others weep.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher, dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning a minister of the king of Kosala. The introductory story is identical with one already given.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">But in this case the king after bestowing great honour on a minister who served him well, gave ear to certain mischief-makers and had him seized and thrown into prison. While he was lying there, he entered upon the First Path. The king, becoming aware of his great merit, released him. He took a scented garland and coming into the presence of the Teacher, saluted him and sat down. Then the Teacher asked if some evil had not befallen him. &ldquo;Yes, venerable sir,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but through evil good has come to me. I have entered on the First Path.&rdquo; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;not you only, but sages of old got good out of evil.&rdquo; And herewith at his request he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born to him as the son of his queen-consort. And they called him prince Ghata. He afterwards acquired a knowledge of the arts at Taxila and ruled his kingdom righteously.</p>
<p class="p7">Now a certain minister misconducted himself in the royal harem. The king, after witnessing the offence with his own eyes, banished him from <span class="t18">[3.112] </span><a id="a8841"></a>his kingdom. At that time a king named Vaṅka ruled in Sāvatthi. The minister went to him and entering his service, just as in the former story, gained the king&rsquo;s ear and got him to seize on the kingdom of Benares. After gaining possession of the kingdom, he had the Bodhisatta bound in chains and threw him into prison. The Bodhisatta entered on an Absorption <span class="t18">{3.169}</span> and sat cross-legged in the air. A burning heat sprang up in the body of Vaṅka. He came and beheld the countenance of the Bodhisatta radiant with the beauty of a full-blown lotus, like to a golden mirror, and in the form of a question repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;While others weep and wail, their cheeks with tears bestained,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why still with smiling face, has Ghata ne&rsquo;er complained?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta, to explain why he did not grieve, recited the remaining verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;To change the past all sorrow is but vain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">It has no blessing for a future state:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why should I, Vaṅka, of my woes complain?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Grief is no helpmate fit with us to mate.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. One that is sick with sorrow pines away,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His food insipid and distasteful grows,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pierced as with arrows, to his grief a prey,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He sinks a laughing-stock to all his foes.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Whether my home be on dry land or sea,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be it in village, or some forest drear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No sorrow ever shall come nigh to me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A soul converted can have nought to fear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. But he that lacks completion in himself</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And is with lust of things of sense fire,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Not the whole world, with all its sordid pelf,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Can e&rsquo;er suffice for such a man&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.170}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Vaṅka therefore, after hearing these four verses, asked forgiveness of the Bodhisatta, and restored him to his kingdom and went his way. But the Bodhisatta handed over the kingdom to his ministers, and retreating to the Himālayas became an ascetic, and without any break in his Absorption he became destined to birth in the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was king Vaṅka, and I myself was king Ghata.&rdquo;</span></p>

That elder, they say, when wicked folk came to him, such as hunters, fishermen and the like, laid down the moral law to them, and any others that he might see from time to time, saying: &ldquo;Receive you the precepts.&rdquo; Through respect for the elder, they could not disobey his words and accepted the precepts, but failed to keep it, and still followed each after his own business. The elder took counsel with his fellow monastics and said: &ldquo;Sirs, these men receive the precepts from me, but keep it not.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.171}</span><span class="t30"> They answered, &ldquo;Venerable sir, you preach the precepts to them against their wishes, and as they dare not disobey what you tell them, they accept it. Henceforth lay not down the precepts to such as these.&rdquo; The elder was offended.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8852"></a><span class="t30">On hearing of the incident they started a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, how that the elder Sāriputta preached the precepts to any that he happened to see. The Teacher came and inquired what was the topic that the monks were debating in their assembly, and on hearing what it was, he said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but formerly also he preached the precepts to any men he might chance to see, even though they did not ask for it.&rdquo; And herewith he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born and grew up in a brahmin household, and became the chief pupil of a world-famed teacher at Taxila. At that time this teacher preached the moral precepts to any one that he might see, fishermen and the like, even if they did not want it, repeatedly bidding them to listen to the Dhamma. But though they heard it, they kept it not. The teacher spoke of it to his disciples. His disciples said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, you preach to them against their wishes, and therefore they break the precepts. Henceforth preach only to those who wish to hear you, and not to those who do not wish.&rdquo; The teacher was filled with regret, but even so he still laid down the precepts to all whom he happened to see.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day some people came from a certain village and invited the teacher to partake of the cakes offered to brahmins. He summoned his disciple named Kāraṇḍiya and said: &ldquo;My dear son, I am not going, but you are to go there with these five hundred disciples, and receive the cakes, and bring the portion that falls to my share.&rdquo; So he sent him. The disciple went, and as he was returning, he spied on the road a cave, and the thought struck him, &ldquo;Our master lays down the precepts, without being asked, to all that he sees. Henceforth I will cause him to preach only to those that wish to hear him.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.172}</span> And while the other disciples were comfortably seated, <span class="t18">[3.114] </span>he arose and picking up a huge stone, flung it into the cave, and again and again repeated the action. Then the disciples stood up and said: &ldquo;Sir, what are you doing?&rdquo; Kāraṇḍiya said not a word. And they went in haste and told their master. The master came and in conversing with Kāraṇḍiya repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Why in forest all alone</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seizing oft a mighty stone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Did you hurl it with a will,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mountain cave as &rsquo;twere to fill?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing his words, Kāraṇḍiya to rouse his master uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;I would make this sea-girt land</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Smooth as palm of human hand:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus I level knoll and hill</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And with stones each hollow fill.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The brahmin, on hearing this, repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er a one of mortal birth</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Has the power to level earth.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Scarce Kāraṇḍiya can hope</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With a single cave to cope.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.173}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The disciple, on hearing this, spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;If a man of mortal birth</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Has no power to level earth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Heretics may well refuse,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brahmin, to adopt your views.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the teacher made an appropriate reply. For he now recognized that other men might differ from him, and thinking: &ldquo;I will no longer act thus,&rdquo; he uttered the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Friend Kāraṇḍiya, in short</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For my good you do exhort:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Earth can never levelled be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Neither can all men agree.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the teacher sing the praises of his disciple. And he, after he had thus admonished his teacher, conducted him home. <span class="t18">{3.174}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended this lesson, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Sāriputta was the brahmin, and I myself was the disciple Kāraṇḍiya.&rdquo;</span></p>

One day they raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, Devadatta is harsh, cruel, and violent. He has not an atom of pity for mortals.&rdquo; When the Teacher came, he inquired what was the topic the monks were assembled to discuss, and on hearing what it was, he said: &ldquo;Monks, not only now, but formerly also he was pitiless.&rdquo; And herewith he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8863"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a young elephant, and growing up a fine handsome beast, he became the leader of the herd, with a following of eighty thousand elephants, and dwelt in the Himālayas. At that time a quail laid her eggs in the feeding-ground of the elephants. When the eggs were ready to be hatched, the young birds broke the shells and came out. Before their wings had grown, and when they were still unable to fly, the Great Being with his following of eighty thousand elephants, in ranging about for food, came to this spot. On seeing them the quail thought: &ldquo;This royal elephant will trample on my young ones and kill them. Lo! I will implore his righteous protection for the defence of my brood.&rdquo; Then she raised her two wings and standing before him repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Elephant of sixty years,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Forest lord amongst your peers,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I am but a puny bird,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You a leader of the herd;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Spare my little ones, I pray.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.175}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being said: &ldquo;O quail, be not troubled. I will protect your offspring.&rdquo; And standing over the young birds, while the eighty thousand elephants passed by, he thus addressed the quail, &ldquo;Behind us comes a solitary rogue elephant. He will not do our bidding. When he comes, do you entreat him too, and so ensure the safety of your offspring.&rdquo; And with these words he made off. And the quail went forth to meet the other elephant, and with both wings uplifted, making respectful salutation, she spoke the second verse: <span class="t18">[3.116]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Roaming over hill and dale</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cherishing your lonely way,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And with wings my homage pay.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I am but a wretched quail,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Spare my tender brood to slay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing her words, the elephant spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;I will slay your young ones, quail;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What can your poor help avail?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My left foot can crush with ease</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Many thousand birds like these.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.176}</span></p>
<p class="p6">And so saying, with his foot he crushed the young birds to atoms, and urinating over them washed them away in a flood of water, and went off loudly trumpeting. The quail sat down on the bough of a tree and said: &ldquo;Then be off with you and trumpet away. You shall very soon see what I will do. You little know what a difference there is between strength of body and strength of mind. Well! I will teach you this lesson.&rdquo; And thus threatening him she repeated the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Power abused is not all gain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Power is often folly&rsquo;s bane.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beast that did my young ones kill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will work you mischief still.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And so saying, shortly afterwards she did a good turn to a crow, and when the crow, who was highly pleased, asked, &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; the quail said: &ldquo;There is nothing else, sir, to be done, but I shall expect you to strike with your beak and to peck out the eyes of this rogue elephant.&rdquo; The crow readily assented, and the quail then did a service to a blue fly, and when the fly asked, &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;When the eyes of this rogue elephant have been put out by the crow, then I want you to let fall an egg upon them.&rdquo; The fly agreed, and then the quail did a kindness to a frog, and when the frog asked what it was to do, she said: &ldquo;When this rogue elephant becomes blind, and shall be searching for water to drink, then take your stand and utter a croak on the top of a mountain, and when he has climbed to the top, come down and croak again at the bottom of the precipice. This much I shall look for at your hands.&rdquo; After hearing what the quail said, the frog readily assented. <span class="t18">{3.177}</span></p>
<p class="p7">So one day the crow with its beak pecked out both the eyes of the elephant, and the fly dropped its eggs upon them, and the elephant being eaten up with maggots was maddened by the pain, and overcome with thirst wandered about seeking for water to drink. At this moment the frog standing on the top of a mountain uttered a croak. Thought the elephant, &ldquo;There must be water there,&rdquo; and climbed up the mountain. Then the frog descended, and standing at the bottom croaked again. The elephant thought: &ldquo;There will be water there,&rdquo; and <span class="t18">[3.117] </span>moved forward towards the precipice, and rolling over fell to the bottom of the mountain and was killed. When the quail knew that the elephant was dead, she said: &ldquo;I have seen the back of my enemy,&rdquo; and in a high state of delight strutted over his body, and passed away to fare according to her deeds.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, one ought not to incur the hostility of anyone. These four creatures, by combining together, brought about the destruction of this elephant, strong as he was.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;A quail with crow, blue fly and frog allied</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Once proved the issue of a deadly feud.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Through them king elephant untimely died:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Therefore all quarrelling should be eschewed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">This verse was spoken after Fully Awakening.</p>

In all other births Devadatta failed to excite so much as an atom of fear in the Bodhisatta, </span><span class="t18">{3.178}</span><a id="a8874"></a><a id="a8875"></a><a id="a8876"></a><a id="a8877"></a><span class="t30"> but in the Culladhammapālajātaka [Ja 358], when the Bodhisatta was only seven months old, he had his hands and feet and head cut off and his body encircled with sword cuts, as it were with a garland. In the Daddarajātaka [Ja 438]</span><a id="a8878"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15525"><span class="t9">{612}</span></a><a id="a8879"></a><a id="a8880"></a><a id="a8881"></a><a id="a8882"></a><a id="a8883"></a><a id="a8884"></a><span class="t30"> he killed him by twisting his neck, and roasted his flesh in an oven and ate it. In the Khantivādijātaka [Ja 313] he had him scourged with two thousand strokes of a whip, and ordered his hands and feet and ears and nose to be cut off, and then had him seized by the hair of his head and dragged along, and when he was stretched at full length on his back, he kicked him in the belly and made off, and that very day the Bodhisatta died. But both in the Cullanandakajātaka [Ja 222] and the Vevaṭiyakapijātaka [Ja 516]</span><a id="a8885"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15527"><span class="t9">{613}</span></a><span class="t30"> he merely had him put to death. Thus did Devadatta for a long time go about trying to slay him, and continued to do so, even after he became a Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So one day they raised a discussion in the Hall of </span><span class="t18">[3.118]</span><span class="t30"> Dhamma, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, Devadatta is continually forming plots to slay the Buddhas. Being minded to kill the Supreme Buddha, he instigated archers to shoot him, he threw down a rock upon him, and let loose the elephant Nālāgiri on him.&rdquo; When the Teacher came and inquired what subject the monks were assembled to discuss, on hearing what it was he said: &ldquo;Monks, not only now, but formerly too he went about to kill me, but now he fails to excite a particle of fear in me, though formerly when I was prince Dhammapāla he brought about my death, though I was his own son, by encircling my body with sword cuts, as it were with a garland.&rdquo; And so saying, he related a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Mahāpatāpa was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as the son of his queen-consort Candā and they named him Dhammapāla. When he was seven months old, his mother had him bathed in scented water and richly dressed and sat playing with him. The king came to the place of her abode. And as she was playing with the boy, being filled with a mother&rsquo;s love for her child, she omitted to rise up on seeing the king. He thought: &ldquo;Even now this woman is filled with pride on account of her boy, and does not value me a straw, but as the boy grows up, she will think, &lsquo;I have a man for my son,&rsquo; and will take no notice of me. I will have him put to death at once.&rdquo; So he returned home, and sitting on his throne summoned the executioner into his presence, with all the instruments of his office. <span class="t18">{3.179}</span> The man put on his yellow robe and wearing a crimson wreath laid his axe upon his shoulder, and carrying a block and a bowl in his hands, came and stood before the king, and saluting him said: &ldquo;What is your pleasure, sire?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Go to the royal closet of the queen, and bring here Dhammapāla,&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p class="p7">But the queen knew that the king had left her in a rage, and laid the Bodhisatta on her bosom and sat weeping. The executioner came and giving her a blow in the back snatched the boy out of her arms and took him to the king and said: &ldquo;What is your pleasure, sire?&rdquo; The king had a board brought and put down before him, and said: &ldquo;Lay him down on it.&rdquo; The man did so. But queen Candā came and stood just behind her son, weeping. Again the executioner said: &ldquo;What is your pleasure, sire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Cut off Dhammapāla&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo; said the king. Queen Candā said: &ldquo;Great king, my boy is only a child, seven months old. He knows nothing. The fault is not his. If there be any fault, it is mine. Therefore bid my hands to be cut off.&rdquo; And to make her meaning clear, she uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Mahāpatāpa&rsquo;s wretched queen,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis I alone to blame have been.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bid Dhammapāla, sire, go free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And off with hands of luckless me.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.119]</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king looked at the executioner. &ldquo;What is your pleasure, sire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Without further delay, off with his hands,&rdquo; said the king. At this moment the executioner took a sharp axe, and lopped off the boy&rsquo;s two hands, as if they had been young bamboo shoots. <span class="t18">{3.180}</span> The boy, when his hands were cut off, neither wept nor lamented, but moved by patience and generosity bore it with resignation. But the queen Candā put the tips of his fingers in her lap and stained with blood went about lamenting. Again the executioner asked, &ldquo;What is your pleasure, sire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Off with his feet,&rdquo; said the king. On hearing this, Candā uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Mahāpatāpa&rsquo;s wretched queen,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis I alone to blame have been.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bid Dhammapāla, sire, go free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And off with feet of luckless me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But the king gave a sign to the executioner, and he cut off both his feet. Queen Candā put his feet also in her lap, and stained with blood, lamented and said: &ldquo;My lord Mahāpatāpa, his feet and hands are cut off. A mother is bound to support her children. I will work for wages and support my son. Give him to me.&rdquo; The executioner said: &ldquo;Sire, is the king&rsquo;s pleasure fulfilled? Is my service finished?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;What then is your pleasure, sire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Off with his head,&rdquo; said the king. Then Candā repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Mahāpatāpa&rsquo;s wretched queen,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis I alone to blame have been.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bid Dhammapāla, sire, go free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And off with head of luckless me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And with these words she offered her own head. Again the executioner asked, &ldquo;What is your pleasure, sire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Off with his head,&rdquo; said the king. So he cut off his head and asked, &ldquo;Is the king&rsquo;s pleasure fulfilled?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;What further am I to do, sire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Catching him with the edge of the sword,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;encircle him with sword cuts as it were with a garland.&rdquo; Then he threw the body of the boy up into the air, and catching it with the edge of his sword, encircled him with sword cuts, as it were with a garland, and scattered the bits on the dais. Candā placed the flesh of the Bodhisatta in her lap, and as she sat on the dais lamenting, she repeated these verses: <span class="t18">{3.181}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;No friendly councillors advise the king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Slay not the heir that from your loins did spring:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. No loving kinsmen urge the tender plea,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Slay not the boy that owes his life to thee.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Moreover after speaking these two verses queen Candā, pressing both her hands upon her heart, repeated the third<a id="a8886"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15529"><span class="t9">{614}</span></a> verse: <span class="t18">[3.120]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;You, Dhammapāla, were by right of birth</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The lord of earth:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your arms, once bathed in oil of sandalwood,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lie steeped in blood.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My fitful breath, alas, is choked with sighs</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And broken cries.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">While she was thus lamenting, her heart broke, as a bamboo snaps, when the grove is on fire, and she fell dead on the spot. The king too being unable to remain on his throne fell down on the dais. An abyss was cleft asunder in the ground, and straightaway he fell into it. Then the solid earth, though many myriads more than two hundred thousand leagues in thickness, being unable to bear with his wickedness, clave asunder and opened a chasm. A flame arose out of the Avīci hell, and seizing upon him, wrapped him about, as with a royal woollen garment, <span class="t18">{3.182}</span> and plunged him into Avīci. His ministers performed the funeral rites of Candā and the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having brought this discourse to an end, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Devadatta was the king, Mahāpajāpatī was Candā, and I myself was prince Dhammapāla.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one faithful young woman manages to convert her new family to the Buddha&rsquo;s teaching, and later, together with her husband, goes forth. The Buddha tells a story of how a doe had saved her lord when he had been trapped by a hunter.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the king of the deer (migarājā),</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a8894"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Faith, Self-sacrifice, Women, Animals.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;O golden foot.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8895"></a><a id="a8896"></a><span class="t30"> This was a story told by the Teacher while in residence at Jetavana, about a maiden of gentle birth in Sāvatthi. She was, they say, the daughter in the household of a servitor of the two chief disciples at Sāvatthi, and was a faithful believer, fondly attached to Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, abounding in good works, wise, and devoted to generosity and such like deeds of piety. Another family in Sāvatthi of equal rank but of heretical views chose her in marriage. Then her parents said: &ldquo;Our daughter is a faithful believer, devoted to the Three Jewels, given to alms and other good works, but you hold heretical views. And as you will not allow her to give alms, or to hear the Dhamma, or to visit the monastery, or to keep the moral law, or to observe the fast days, as she pleases, we will not give her to you in marriage. Choose you a maiden from a family of heretical views like yourselves.&rdquo; When their offer was rejected, they said: &ldquo;When she comes to our house let your daughter do everything of this kind, as she pleases. We will not prevent her. Only grant us this boon.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take her then,&rdquo; they answered. So they celebrated the marriage </span><span class="t18">[3.121] </span><span class="t30">festivity at an auspicious season and led her home. She proved faithful in the discharge of her duties, and a devoted wife, and rendered due service to her father-in-law and mother-in-law.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8897"></a><a id="a8898"></a><span class="t30">One day she said to her husband, &ldquo;I wish, my lord, to give alms to our family monastics.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, my dear, give them just what you please.&rdquo; So one day she invited these monastics, and making a great entertainment, she fed them with choice food, and taking a seat apart from them she said: &ldquo;Venerable sirs, this family is heretical and unbelieving. They are ignorant of the value of the Three Jewels. Well then, sirs, until this family understands the value of the Three Jewels, do you continue to receive your food here.&rdquo; The monastics assented and continually ate their meals there. Again she addressed her husband, </span><span class="t18">{3.183}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Sir, the monastics constantly come here. Why do you not see them?&rdquo; On hearing this he said: &ldquo;Very well, I will see them.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On the morrow she told him when the monastics had finished their meal. He came and sat respectfully on one side, conversing affably with the monastics. Then the Captain of the Dhamma preached the Dhamma to him. He was so charmed with the exposition of the faith, and the behaviour of the monastics, that from that day forward he prepared mats for the elders to sit on, and strained water for them, and after the meal listened to the exposition of the faith. By and by his heretical views gave way.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8899"></a><span class="t30">So one day the elder in expounding the faith declared the Truths to the man and his wife, and when the sermon was ended, they were both established in the fruition of the First Path. Thenceforth all of them, from his parents down to the hired servants, gave up their heretical views, and became devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So one day this young girl said to her husband, &ldquo;What, sir, have I to do with the household life? I wish to adopt the ascetic life.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, my dear,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I too will become an ascetic.&rdquo; And he conducted her with great pomp to a nunnery, and had her admitted as a novice, and himself too went to the Teacher and begged to be ordained. The Teacher admitted him first as a novice and afterwards to full monastic orders. They both received clear spiritual vision, and shortly became an Arahat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day they raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, a certain woman by reason of her own faith and that of her husband became a novice. And both of them having adopted the ascetic life, and gained clear spiritual vision, became Arahats.&rdquo; The Teacher, when he came, inquired what was the topic the monks were sitting in council to discuss, and on hearing what it was, he said: &ldquo;Monks, not only now, did she set her husband free from the bonds of passion. Formerly too she freed even sages of old from the bonds of death.&rdquo; And with these words he held his peace, but being pressed by them he related a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a young stag, and grew up a beautiful and graceful creature, of the colour of gold. His fore and hind feet were covered, as it were, with a preparation of lac. <span class="t18">{3.184}</span> His horns were like a silver wreath, his eyes resembled round jewels, and his mouth was like a ball of crimson wool. The doe that was his mate was also a handsome creature, and they lived happily and harmoniously together. Eight myriads of dappled deer followed in the train of the Bodhisatta. While they were thus living there, a certain hunter set a snare in the deer drives.</p>
<p class="p7">So one day the Bodhisatta, while leading his herd, entangled his foot in the snare, and thinking to break the noose he tugged at it and cut the skin of his foot. Again he tugged it, and hurt the flesh, and a third time and injured the tendon. And the noose penetrated to the very bone. Not <span class="t18">[3.122] </span>being able to break the snare, the stag was so alarmed with the fear of death that he uttered the cry of capture. On hearing it the herd of deer fled in a panic. But the doe, as she fled, looking amongst the deer, missed the Bodhisatta, and thought: &ldquo;This panic must certainly have something to do with my lord,&rdquo; and flying in haste to him, with many tears and lamentations she said: &ldquo;My lord, you are very strong. Why can you not get the better of the snare? Put forth your strength and break it.&rdquo; And thus stirring him up to make an effort, she uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;O golden foot, no effort spare</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To loose thyself from thongéd snare.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How could I joy, bereft of you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To range amidst the woodland free?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.185}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta, on hearing this, responded in a second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8900"></a><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;I spare no effort, but in vain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My liberty I cannot gain.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The more I struggle to get loose,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The sharper bites the thongéd noose.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the doe said: &ldquo;My lord, fear not. By my own power will I entreat the hunter, and by giving up my own life I will gain yours in exchange.&rdquo; And thus comforting the Great Being, she continued to embrace the blood-stained Bodhisatta. But the hunter approached, with sword and spear in hand, like to the destroying flame at the beginning of a cycle. On seeing him, the doe said: &ldquo;My lord, the hunter is coming. By my own power I will rescue you. Be not afraid.&rdquo; And thus comforting the stag, she went to meet the hunter, and standing at a respectful distance, she saluted him and said: &ldquo;My lord, my husband is of the colour of gold, and endued with all the virtues, the king of eight myriads of deer.&rdquo; And thus singing the praises of the Bodhisatta, she begged for her own death, if only the king of the herd might remain intact, and she repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Let on the earth a leafy bed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hunter, where we may fall, be spread:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And drawing from its sheath your sword,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Slay me and afterwards my lord.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The hunter, on hearing this, was struck with amazement and said: &ldquo;Even human beings give not up their lives for their king; much less the beasts. What can this mean? This creature speaks with a sweet voice in the language of men. <span class="t18">{3.186}</span> This day will I grant life to her and to her mate.&rdquo; And greatly charmed with her, the hunter uttered the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;A beast that speaks with voice of men,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ne&rsquo;er came before within my ken.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Rest you in peace, my gentle deer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And cease, O golden foot, to fear.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.123]</span></p>
<p class="p6">The doe seeing the Bodhisatta set at his ease, was highly delighted and returning thanks to the hunter, repeated the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;As I today rejoice to see</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This mighty beast at liberty,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So, hunter, that did loose the trap,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;I scent the fragrance.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher, while living at Jetavana, told concerning a discontented monk. The Teacher asked if it were true that he longed for the world, and what had he seen to make him regret having taken orders. The monk answered, &ldquo;It was all owing to the charms of a woman.&rdquo; The Teacher said: &ldquo;Verily, monk, there is no possibility of being on one&rsquo;s guard against womenfolk. Sages of old, though they took the precaution to dwell in the abode of the Garuḷas, failed to be on their guard against them.&rdquo; And being urged by him, the Teacher related a story of the past.</span><span class="t18"> [3.124]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past king Tamba reigned in Benares, and his queen-consort named Sussondī was a woman of surpassing beauty. At that time the Bodhisatta came to life as a young Garuḷa. Now the Nāga island was then known as Seruma island, and the Bodhisatta lived on this island in the abode of the Garuḷas. And he went to Benares, disguised as a youth, and played at dice with king Tamba. Remarking his beauty they said to Sussondī, &ldquo;Such and such a youth plays at dice with our king.&rdquo; She longed to see him, and one day she adorned herself and repaired to the dice-chamber. <span class="t18">{3.188}</span> There taking her stand amongst the attendants, she fixed her gaze on the youth. He too gazed on the queen, and the pair fell in love with one another. The Garuḷa king by an act of supernatural power stirred up a storm in the city. The people, through fear of the house falling, fled out of the palace. By his power he caused it to be dark, and carrying off the queen with him in the air, he made his way to his own who lived on Nāga island. But no one knew of the coming or going of Sussondī. The Garuḷa took his pleasure with her, and still came to play at dice with the king. Now the king had a minstrel named Sagga, and not knowing where the queen had gone, the king addressed the minstrel and said: &ldquo;Go now and explore every land and sea, and discover what has become of the queen.&rdquo; And so saying he bade him begone.</p>
<p class="p7">He took what was necessary for his journey, and beginning the search from the city gate, at last came to Bhārukaccha. At that time certain merchants of Bhārukaccha were setting sail for the Golden Land. He approached them and said: &ldquo;I am a minstrel. If you remit my passage money, I will act as your minstrel. Take me with you.&rdquo; They agreed to do so, and putting him on board weighed anchor. When the ship was fairly off, they called him and bade him make music for them. He said: &ldquo;I would make music, but if I do, the fish will be so excited that your vessel will be wrecked.&rdquo; &ldquo;If a mere mortal,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;make music, there will be no excitement on the part of the fish. Play to us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then do not be angry with me,&rdquo; he said, and tuning his lute and keeping perfect harmony between the words of his song and the accompaniment of the lute string, he made music for them. The fish were maddened at the sound and splashed about. And a certain sea monster leaping up fell upon the ship and broke it in two. Sagga lying on a plank was carried along by the wind till he reached a banyan tree in the Nāga island, where the Garuḷa king lived.</p>
<p class="p7">Now queen Sussondī, whenever the Garuḷa king went to play at dice, came down from her place of abode, <span class="t18">{3.189}</span> and as she was wandering on the edge of the shore, she saw and recognized the minstrel Sagga, and asked him how he got there. He told her the whole story. And she comforted him and said: &ldquo;Do not be afraid,&rdquo; and embracing him in her arms, she carried him to her abode and laid him on a couch. And when he was greatly revived, she fed him with heavenly <span class="t18">[3.125] </span>food, bathed him in heavenly scented-water, arrayed him in heavenly raiment, and adorned him with flowers of heavenly perfume, and made him recline upon a heavenly couch. Thus did she watch over him, and whenever the Garuḷa king returned, she hid her lover, and so soon as the king was gone, under the influence of passion she took her pleasure with him. At the end of a month and a half from that time some merchants, who dwelt at Benares, landed at the foot of the banyan tree in this island, to get firewood and water. The minstrel went on board ship with them, and on reaching Benares, as soon as he saw the king, while he was playing at dice, Sagga took his lute, and making music recited the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8915"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;I scent the fragrance of the timira grove,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I hear the moaning of the weary sea:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tamba, I am tormented with my love,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For fair Sussondī dwells afar from me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the Garuḷa king uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;How did you cross the stormy main,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Seruma in safety gain?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How did you Sagga, tell me, pray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To fair Sussondī win your way?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.190}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sagga repeated three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;With trading-folk from Bhārukaccha land</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My ship was wrecked by monsters of the sea;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I on a plank did safely gain the strand,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. When an anointed queen with gentle hand</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Upbore me tenderly upon her knee,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As though to her a true son I might be.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. She food and raiment brought, and as I lay</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With love-lorn eyes hung o&rsquo;er my couch all day.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Know, Tamba, well; this word is truth I say.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Garuḷa, while the minstrel thus spake, was filled with regrets and said: &ldquo;Though I dwelt in the abode of the Garuḷas, I failed to guard her safely. What is this wicked woman to me?&rdquo; So he brought her back and presented her to the king and departed. And thenceforth he did not come there any more.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the worldly-minded monk attained fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the king of Benares, and I myself was the Garuḷa king.&rdquo;</span></p>

On a certain occasion the two chief elders resolved during the rainy season to devote themselves to solitude. So they bade the Teacher farewell and leaving the company of the monks they went forth from Jetavana, carrying their bowl and robes with their own hands, and lived in a forest near a border village. And a certain man, who waited on the elders and lived upon their leftovers, dwelt apart in the same place. On seeing how happily these elders lived together, he thought: &ldquo;I wonder if it is possible to set them at variance.&rdquo; So he drew near to Sāriputta and said: &ldquo;Can it be, venerable sir, that there is some quarrel between you and the venerable chief elder Moggallāna?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why so, sir?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;He ever, venerable sir, speaks in your dispraise and says, &ldquo;When I am gone, what is Sāriputta worth compared with me in caste, lineage, family and country, or in the power of Attainments in the sacred volumes?&rdquo; The elder smiled and said: &ldquo;Be off, sir!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8926"></a><span class="t30">Another day he drew near to the chief elder Moggallāna, and said the same thing. He too smiled and said: &ldquo;Be off, sir!&rdquo; Moggallāna went to Sāriputta and asked, &ldquo;Has this fellow, who lives on our leavings, said anything to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, friend, he has.&rdquo; &ldquo;And he said exactly the same thing to me. We must drive him away.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, friend, drive him away.&rdquo; The elder said: &ldquo;You are not to come here,&rdquo; and snapping his fingers at him, he drove him away. The two elders lived happily together, and returning to the Teacher, made obeisance to him and sat down. The Teacher spoke kindly to them and asked if they had kept their retreat pleasantly. They said: &ldquo;A certain beggar wished to set us at variance, but failing in the attempt he ran away.&rdquo; The Teacher said: &ldquo;Verily, Sāriputta, not only now, but formerly also, he thought to set you at variance, but failing in the attempt he ran away.&rdquo; And hereupon at his request he related a story of bygone days.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8927"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a Tree Devatā in a forest. <span class="t18">{3.192}</span> At that time a lion and a tiger lived in a mountain cave in that forest. A jackal was in attendance on them, and living on their leftovers began to grow fat in body. And one day he was struck with the thought: &ldquo;I have never yet eaten the flesh of a lion or a tiger. I must set these two animals at variance, and when in consequence of their quarrel they have come by their death, I will eat their flesh.&rdquo; So he drew near to the lion and said: &ldquo;Is there any quarrel, sir, between you and the tiger?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why so, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Your reverence,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he ever speaks in your dispraise and says, &ldquo;When I <span class="t18">[3.127] </span>am gone, this lion will never attain to the sixteenth part of my personal beauty, nor of my stature and girth, nor of my natural strength and power.&rdquo; Then the lion said to him, &ldquo;Off with you. He will never speak thus of me.&rdquo; Then the jackal drew near to the tiger also, and spoke after the same manner. On hearing him, the tiger hastened to the lion, and asked, &ldquo;Friend, is it true, that you said so and so of me?&rdquo; And he spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8928"></a><a id="a8929"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Is it thus Sudāṭha</span><a id="a8930"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15537"><span class="t19">{618}</span></a><span class="t12"> speaks of me?</span></p>

<p class="p13"><a id="a8931"></a><span class="t12">Subāhu still to me must yield.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this Sudāṭha repeated the four remaining verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Is it thus Subāhu speaks of me?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In grace of form and pedigree,</span></p>

<p class="p6">When the qualities of a friend had been thus set forth in these four verses, the tiger said: &ldquo;The fault is mine,&rdquo; and begged pardon of the lion. And they continued to live happily together in the same place. But the jackal departed and fled elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having brought his lesson to an end, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the jackal was the beggar who lived on leftovers, the lion was Sāriputta, the tiger Moggallāna, and the deity that dwelt in that forest and saw the whole thing with his own eyes was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

The king, they say, owing to his reputation for virtue, regarded him with special honour, beyond what was paid to other brahmins. He thought: &ldquo;Can it be that the king regards me with special honour, because I am endowed with virtue, or as one devoted to the acquisition of learning? I will just test the comparative importance of virtue and learning.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So one day he abstracted a coin from the royal treasury board. The treasurer, such was his respect for him, did not say a word. It occurred a second time, and the treasurer said nothing. But on the third occasion he had him arrested as one who lived by robbery, and brought him before the king. And when the king asked what his offence was, he charged him with stealing the king&rsquo;s property. </span><span class="t18">{3.194}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Is this true, brahmin?&rdquo; said the king.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;I am not in the habit of stealing your property, sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I had my doubts as to the relative importance of virtue and learning, and in testing which was the greater of the two, I thrice took a coin without permission, and then I was given into custody and brought before you. Now that I know the greater efficacy of virtue compared with learning, I no longer wish to live a layman&rsquo;s life. I will become an ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8941"></a><span class="t30">On obtaining leave to do so, without so much as looking back on his house door, he went straight to Jetavana and begged the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher granted him both novice and full monastic orders. And he had been no long time in orders, before he attained to Insight and reached Arahatship.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8942"></a><span class="t30">The incident was discussed in the Dhamma Hall, how that a certain brahmin, after proving the power of virtue, took orders and obtaining Insight became an Arahat. When the Teacher came and inquired of the monks what was the nature of the topic they were sitting to discuss, on hearing what it was, he said: &ldquo;Not this man only now, but sages of old also put virtue to the proof, and by becoming ascetics worked out their own safety.&rdquo; And herewith he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family. And when he came of age, he acquired every liberal art at Taxila, and on his return to Benares he went to see the king. The king offered him the post of family priest, and as he kept the Five Precepts, the king looked upon him with respect as a virtuous man. &ldquo;Can it be,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;that the king regards me with respect as a virtuous man, or as one devoted to the acquisition of learning?&rdquo; And the whole story corresponds exactly with the modern instance, but in this case the brahmin said: &ldquo;Now I know the great importance <span class="t18">[3.129] </span>of virtue compared with learning.&rdquo; And hereupon he spoke these five verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Virtue and learning I wanted to test;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Henceforth I doubt not that virtue is best.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Virtue excels vain gifts of form and birth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Apart from virtue learning has no worth.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. A prince or peasant, if to wrong enslaved,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In neither world from misery is saved.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Men of high caste with those of base degree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If virtuous here, in heaven will equal be. </span><span class="t18">{3.195}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. Not birth, nor lore, nor friendship aught avails,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pure virtue only future bliss entails.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being sing the praises of virtue, and having gained the consent of the king, that very day he betook himself to the Himālayas region, and adopting the ascetic life he developed the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and became destined to birth in the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher here ended this lesson and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time it was I myself that put virtue to the test and adopted the ascetic life.&rdquo;</span></p>

There came a time when this merchant loaded five hundred carts with local produce and gave orders to the men in charge to go to the great merchant Anāthapiṇḍika, and barter the wares in his correspondent&rsquo;s shop for their value, and bring back the goods received in exchange. So they came to Sāvatthi, and found Anāthapiṇḍika. First making him a present, they told him their business. &ldquo;You are welcome,&rdquo; said the great man, and ordered them to be lodged there and provided with money for their needs. After kindly enquiries after their master&rsquo;s health, he bartered their merchandise and gave them the goods in exchange. Then they went back to their own district, and reported what had happened.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Shortly afterwards, Anāthapiṇḍika similarly dispatched five hundred carts with merchandise to the very district in which they dwelt; and his people, when they had got there, went, present in hand, to call upon the border merchant. &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;From Sāvatthi,&rdquo; replied they; &ldquo;from your correspondent, Anāthapiṇḍika.&rdquo; &ldquo;Anyone can call himself Anāthapiṇḍika,&rdquo; said he with a sneer; and taking their present, he bade them begone, giving them neither lodging nor a gift. So they bartered their goods for themselves and brought back the wares in exchange to Sāvatthi, with the story of the reception they had had.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now it chanced that this border merchant dispatched another caravan of five hundred carts to Sāvatthi; and his people came with a present in their hands to wait upon Anāthapiṇḍika. But, as soon as Anāthapiṇḍika&rsquo;s people caught sight of them, they said: &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll see, sir, that they are properly lodged, fed, and supplied with money for their needs.&rdquo; And they took the strangers outside the city and bade them unyoke their carts at a suitable spot, adding that rice and a gift would come from Anāthapiṇḍika&rsquo;s house. About the middle watch of the night, having collected a band of serving-men and slaves, they looted the whole caravan, carried off every garment the men had got, drove away their oxen, and took the wheels off the carts, leaving the latter but removing the wheels. Without so much as a shirt among the lot of them, the terrified strangers sped away and managed to reach their home on the border. Then Anāthapiṇḍika&rsquo;s people told him the whole story. &ldquo;This capital story,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;shall be my gift to the Teacher today,&rdquo; and away he went and told it to the Teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;This is not the first time, sir,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;that this border merchant has shown this disposition; he was just the same in days gone by.&rdquo; Then, at Anāthapiṇḍika&rsquo;s request, he told the following story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a very wealthy merchant in that city. And he too had as a correspondent a border merchant whom he had never seen and all came to pass as above.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In this version when the merchant of Benares was told that the followers of the foreign merchant were robbed of all their property and, after losing everything they possessed, had to take to flight, he said: &ldquo;Because they failed to do what they ought for the strangers who came to them, they find no one ready to do them a good turn.&rdquo; And so saying he repeated these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8951"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Who spite of honour, while he plays the part</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of humble servant, loathes you in his heart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Poor in good works and rich in words alone &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ah! Such a friend you surely would not own. </span><span class="t18">[3.130]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Be you in deed to every promise true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Refuse to promise what you can not do;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wise men on empty braggarts look askew.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. No friend suspects a quarrel without cause,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For ever watching to discover flaws:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But he that trustful on a friend can rest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As little child upon its mother&rsquo;s breast,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Will ne&rsquo;er by any stranger&rsquo;s deed or word,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be separated from his bosom&rsquo;s lord.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Who draws the yoke of human friendship well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of bliss increased and honoured life can tell:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. But one that tastes the joys of calm repose,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Drinking sweet draughts of Truth &ndash; he only knows</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Escape from defilements and all his woes.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.197}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being, disgusted by coming into contact with evil associates, through the power of solitude, bring his teaching to a climax and lead men to the deathless and great Nibbāna.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time I myself was the merchant of Benares.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">Alternative Title: Devatāpucchitapañhā (Comm)</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">The Devas who lived in the king&rsquo;s parasol asked the king four questions, and he agreed to ask his brahmin seers, but they did not know the answers. Only the wise Mahosadha could answer correctly.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (paṇḍita) Mahosadha.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Past Source: Ja 546 Mahā-ummagga,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Quoted at: Ja 364 Khajjopanaka.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t15">Keywords: Wisdom, Clever answers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This question about a fire-fly will be set forth in full in the Mahā-ummagga [Ja 546].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now the deity that dwelt in the royal parasol no longer hearing the voice of the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s discourse wondered what might be the cause, and when she had found it out determined to bring the sage back. So at night she appeared through a hole in the circuit of the parasol, and asked the king four questions... The king could not answer, and said so, but offered to ask his wise men, asking a day&rsquo;s delay.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8957"></a><span class="t11">Next day he sent a message summoning them, but they replied, &ldquo;We are ashamed to show ourselves in the street, shaven as we are.&rdquo; So he sent them four skullcaps to wear on their heads. (That is the origin of these caps, so they say.) Then they came, and sat where they were invited to go, and the king said: &ldquo;Senaka, last night the deity that dwells in my parasol asked me four questions, which I could not solve but I said I would ask my wise men. Pray solve them for me.&rdquo; And then he recited the first verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">1. &ldquo;He strikes with hands and feet, and beats on the face; yet, O king, he is dear, and grows dearer than a husband.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Senaka stammered out whatever came first, &ldquo;Strikes how, strikes whom,&rdquo; and could make neither head nor tail of it; the others were all dumb. The king was full of distress. When again at night the Devatā asked whether he had found out the riddle, he said: &ldquo;I asked my four wise men, and not even they could say.&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;What do they know? Save wise Mahosadha there is none can solve it. If you do not send for him and get him to solve these questions, I will cleave your head with this fiery blade.&rdquo; After thus frightening him she went on, &ldquo;O king, when you want fire don&rsquo;t blow on a firefly, and when you want milk don&rsquo;t milk a horn.&rdquo; Then she repeated the Firefly Question of the Fifth Book:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8958"></a><span class="t25">2. &ldquo;When light is extinguished, who that goes in search of fire ever thinks a firefly to be fire, if he sees it at night?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">3. If he crumbles over it cow-dung and grass, it is a foolish idea; he cannot make it burn. So also a beast gets no benefit by wrong means, if it milks a cow by the horn where milk will not flow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">4. By many means men obtain benefit, by punishment of enemies and kindness shown to friends.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">5. By winning over the chiefs of the army, and by the counsel of friends, the lords of the earth possess the earth and the fulness thereof.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">&ldquo;They are not like you, blowing at a firefly in the belief that it is a fire: you are like one blowing at a firefly when fire is at hand, like one who throws down the balance and weighs with the hand, like one who wants milk and milks the horn, when you ask deep questions of Senaka and the like of him. What do they know? Like fireflies are they, like a great flaming fire is Mahosadha blazing with wisdom. If you do not find out this question, you are a dead man.&rdquo; Having thus terrified the king, she disappeared.</span></p>
