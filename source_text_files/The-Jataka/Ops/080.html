The occasion will be explained in the Sāmajātaka [Ja 540].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain monk who supported his mother. They say that there was a wealthy merchant at Sāvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, he exclaimed that he would go too.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the Tathāgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parents&rsquo; consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then he thought to himself, &ldquo;I live here distracted &ndash; it is not suitable for me,&rdquo; and he became anxious to reach the goal of insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the son&rsquo;s place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, &ldquo;Tell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchant&rsquo;s family in Sāvatthi.&rdquo; &ldquo;O friend, don&rsquo;t ask for news of that family.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;They say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When he heard the other&rsquo;s words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, &ldquo;O sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;they are my own father and mother, I am their son.&rdquo; &ldquo;O friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you &ndash; do you go and take care of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;For twelve years,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;I have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit: I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for heaven.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from Sāvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to Sāvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: &ldquo;Shall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?&rdquo; Then he said to himself, &ldquo;In old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.&rdquo; So he left the road to Sāvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the Mātiposakasutta [SN 7.19]. As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: &ldquo;If I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, &lsquo;A son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,&rsquo; I went away before without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.&rdquo; So he took his ticket and his ticket-food and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to Sāvatthi and he thought to himself, &ldquo;Shall I first get the gruel or see my parents?&rdquo; He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their round for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, &ldquo;We have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.&rdquo; When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At last the father said to the mother, &ldquo;Go to him; can this be your son?&rdquo; She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: &ldquo;Do not grieve, I will support you,&rdquo; so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, &ldquo;Your complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale &ndash; has some illness come upon you?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;No illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,&rdquo; and he told them the history. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;the Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.&rdquo; When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;So and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the Teacher sent for this monk, and asked him, &ldquo;Is what I hear true, monk, that you support lay folks?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; &ldquo;My mother and father, sir.&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Well done, monk! Wise men of old, even when embodied as lower animals, having been born as parrots even, when their parents grew old laid them in a nest and fed them with food which they brought in their own beaks.&rdquo; So saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11179"></a>In the past, a king named king Magadha reigned in Rājagaha. At that time there stood a brahmin village, named Sālindiya, towards the north-east as you go out of the city. In this north-eastern district was property belonging to Magadha. There was a brahmin who lived in Sālindiya, whose name was Kosiyagotta,<a id="a11180"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16224"><span class="t9">{946}</span></a><a id="a11181"></a> and he held an estate of one thousand acres,<a id="a11182"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16226"><span class="t9">{947}</span></a> where he grew rice. When the crop was standing, he made a stout fence, and gave the land in charge to his own men, to one fifty acres, to another sixty, and so he distributed among them some five hundred acres of his estate. <span class="t18">{4.277}</span><a id="a11183"></a> The other five hundred he delivered to a hired man for a wage, and the man made a hut there and dwelt there day and night. Now to the north-east of this estate was a certain great wood of silk-cotton trees,<a id="a11184"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16228"><span class="t9">{948}</span></a> growing upon the flat top of a hill, and in this wood lived a great number of parrots. <span class="t18">[4.176]</span></p>
<p class="p7">At that time the Bodhisatta was born among this flock of parrots, as the son of the king of the parrots. He grew up handsome and strong, big his body was as the nave of a cart-wheel. His father now grown old said to him, &ldquo;I am able no longer to go far afield; do you take care of this flock,&rdquo; and committed the lordship of it to his son. From the next day onwards he refused to permit his parents to go foraging; but with the whole flock away he flew to the Himālayas hills, and after eating his fill of the clumps of rice that grew wild there, on his return brought food sufficient for his mother and father, and fed them with it.</p>
<p class="p7">One day the parrots asked him a question. &ldquo;Formerly,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;the rice was ripe by this time on the Magadha farm; is it grown now or not?&rdquo; &ldquo;Go and see,&rdquo; he replied, and then sent two parrots to find out. The parrots departed, and alighted in the Magadha lands, in that part which was guarded by the hired man; rice they ate, and one head of rice they took back with them to their wood, and dropped it before the Great Being&rsquo;s feet, saying: &ldquo;Such is the rice which grows there.&rdquo; He went next day to the farm, and alighted, with all his flock. The man ran this way and that, trying to drive off the birds, but drive them away he could not. The rest of the parrots ate, and departed with empty beaks; but the parrot king gathered together a quantity of rice, and brought it back to his parents. Next day the parrots ate the rice there again, and so afterwards. Then the man began to think, <span class="t18">{4.278}</span> &ldquo;If these creatures go on eating for another few days, there will not be a bit left. The brahmin will have a price put on the rice, and fine me in the sum. I will go tell him.&rdquo; Taking a handful of rice, and a gift with it, he went to see the brahmin, and greeted him, and stood on one side. &ldquo;Well, my good man,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;is there a good crop of rice?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, brahmin, there is,&rdquo; he replied, and repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;The crop of rice is very nice, but I would have you know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The parrots are devouring it, I cannot make them go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. There is one bird, of all the herd the finest, who first feeds,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then takes a bundle in his beak to meet his future needs.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the brahmin heard this, he conceived an affection for the parrot king. &ldquo;My man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you know how to set a snare?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo; The master then addressed him in this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Then set a snare of horse&rsquo;s hair that captured he may be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And see you take the bird alive and bring him here to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The farm watchman was much pleased that no price had been put upon the rice, and no debt spoken of. He went straight and made a snare of horsehair. Then he found out when they were like to descend that day; and spying out the place where the parrot king alighted, next day very early in the morning he made a cage about the size of a waterpot, and set <span class="t18">[4.177] </span>the snare, and sat down in his hut looking for the parrots to come. The parrot king came amidst all his flock; and he being by no means greedy, <span class="t18">{4.279}</span> came down in the same place as yesterday, with his foot right in the noose. When he found his foot fast he thought: &ldquo;Now if I cry out the cry of the captured, my kinsfolk will be so terrified, they will fly away foodless. I must endure until they have finished their food.&rdquo; When at last he perceived that they had taken their fill, being in fear of his life, he thrice cried the cry of the captured. All the birds flew off. Then the king of the parrots said: &ldquo;All these my kith and kin, and not one to look back at me! What wrong have I done?&rdquo; And upbraiding them he uttered a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;They ate, they drank, and now away they hasten every one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I only caught within a snare: what evil have I done?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The watchman heard the cry of the parrot king, and the sound of the other parrots flying through the air. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; thought he. Up he got from his hut, and went to the place of his snare, and there he saw the king of the parrots. &ldquo;The very bird I set the snare for is caught!&rdquo; he cried, in high delight. He took the parrot out of the snare, and tied both his feet together, and making his way to Sālindiya village, he delivered the bird to the brahmin. The brahmin in his strong affection for the Great Being, caught hold of him tight in both hands, and seating him on his hip, bespoke him in these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;The bellies of all others are outbellied far by you:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">First a full meal, then off you fly with a good beak-full too!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Have you a granary there to fill? Or do you hate me sore?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I ask it you, come tell me true &ndash; where do you put your store?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, the parrot king answered, repeating in a human voice sweet as honey the seventh verse: <span class="t18">{4.280}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;I hate you not, O Kosiya! No granary I own;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Once in my wood I pay a debt, and also grant a loan,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And there I store a treasure up: so be my answer known.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the brahmin asked him:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;What is that loan the which you grant? What is the debt you pay?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell me the treasure you store up, and then fly free away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this request of the brahmin the parrot king made reply, explaining his intent in four verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;My callow chicks, my tender brood, whose wings are still ungrown,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who shall support me by and by: to them I grant the loan.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Then my old ancient parents, who far from youth&rsquo;s bounds are set,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With that within my beak I bring, to them I pay my debt.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. And other birds of helpless wing, and weak full many more,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To these I give in generosity: this sages call my store.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. This is that loan the which I grant, this is the debt I pay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And this the treasure I store up: now I have said my say.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.178]</span></p>
<p class="p6">The brahmin was pleased when he heard this pious discourse from the Great Being; and he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;What noble principles of life! How blessed is this bird!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From many men who live on earth such rules are never heard. </span><span class="t18">{4.281}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. Eat, eat your fill whereas you will, with all your kindred too;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And, parrot! Let us meet-again: I love the sight of you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">With these words, he looked upon the Great Being with a soft heart, as though it were his only son; and loosing the bonds from his feet, he rubbed them with oil a hundred times refined, and seated him on a seat of honour, and gave him to eat sweetened corn upon a golden dish, and gave him sugar-water to drink. After this the king of the parrots warned the brahmin to be careful, reciting this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;O Kosiya! Within your dwelling here</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I had both food and drink and friendship dear.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Give you to those whose burden is laid down,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Support your parents when they old are grown.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11185"></a>The brahmin then delighted in heart uttered his exalted utterance in this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;Surely Luck&rsquo;s goddess came herself today</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When I set eyes upon this peerless bird!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will do kindly deeds and never stay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now that the parrot&rsquo;s sweet voice I have heard.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11186"></a>But the Great Being refused to accept the thousand acres which the brahmin offered him, but took only eight acres. The brahmin set up boundary stones, and made over this property to him; and then, raising his hands to his head in reverence, he said: &ldquo;Go in peace, my lord, and console your weeping parents,&rdquo; and then let him go. Much pleased, he took a head of rice, and carried it to his parents, and dropped it before them, saying: &ldquo;Arise now, my dear parents!&rdquo; They arose at his word, with weeping faces. <span class="t18">{4.282}</span><a id="a11187"></a> Then flocks of parrots began together, asking, &ldquo;How did you get free, my lord?&rdquo; He told them the whole story from beginning to end. And Kosiya followed<a id="a11188"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16230"><span class="t9">{949}</span></a> the advice of the king of the parrots, and distributed much alms to the righteous men, and ascetics, and brahmins.</p>
<p class="p7">The last verse was repeated by the Teacher explaining this:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;This Kosiya with joy and great delight</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Common and plentiful made drink and food:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With food and drink he satisfied aright</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brahmins and holy men, himself all good.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: &ldquo;Thus, monks, to support one&rsquo;s parents is the traditional way of the wise and good.&rdquo; Then, having declared the Truths, he identified the Jātaka, now at the conclusion of the Truths that monk became established in the fruit of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time the Buddha&rsquo;s followers were the flock of parrots, two of the king&rsquo;s family were the father and mother, Channa was the watchman, Ānanda the brahmin, and I was myself the king of the parrots.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a11199"></a><span class="t30">This Jātaka must be told beginning from the Distant Epoch of the Buddha&rsquo;s existence.</span><a id="a11200"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16232"><span class="t9">{950}</span></a><a id="a11201"></a><span class="t30"> But the story of the Epochs, as far as the lion&rsquo;s roar of Kassapa</span><a id="a11202"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16234"><span class="t9">{951}</span></a><a id="a11203"></a><span class="t30"> of Uruvelā, in Laṭṭhivana,</span><a id="a11204"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16236"><span class="t9">{952}</span></a><a id="a11205"></a><span class="t30"> the Bamboo Forest, has been told before in the Apaṇṇakajātaka [Ja 1].</span><a id="a11206"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16238"><span class="t9">{953}</span></a><a id="a11207"></a><a id="a11208"></a><a id="a11209"></a><span class="t30"> Beginning from that point you will read in the Vessantarajātaka [Ja 547] the continuation of it as far as to the coming to Kapilavatthu. The Teacher, seated in his father&rsquo;s house, during the meal, recounted the Mahādhammapālajātaka [Ja 447]; and after the meal was done he said: &ldquo;I will praise the noble qualities of Rāhula&rsquo;s mother in her own house, by telling the Candakinnarajātaka [Ja 485].&rdquo; Then handing his bowl to the king, with the two chief disciples he passed over to the house of Rāhula&rsquo;s mother. At that time there were forty thousand dancing girls who lived in her presence, and of them a thousand and ninety were maidens of the warrior caste. When the lady heard of the Tathāgata&rsquo;s coming she bade all these put on yellow robes, and they did so. </span><span class="t18">{4.283}</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher came and took his seat in a place which was assigned him. Then all the women cried out with one voice, and there was a great sound of lamentation. Rāhula&rsquo;s mother having wept and so put away her grief, welcomed the Teacher, and sat down, with the deep reverence due to a king.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the king began the tale of her goodness, &ldquo;Listen to me, sir; she heard that you wore yellow robes, and so she robed herself in yellow; that garlands and such things are to be given up, and lo she has given up garlands and sits upon the ground. When you entered upon the ascetic life she became a widow; and refused the gifts that other kings sent her. So faithful is her heart to you.&rdquo; Thus he told of her goodness in many different ways. The Teacher said: &ldquo;It is no marvel, great king! That now in my last existence the lady should love me, and should be of faithful heart and led by me alone. So also, even when born as an animal, she was faithful and mine alone.&rdquo; Then at the king&rsquo;s request he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11210"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was king in Benares the Great Being was born in the region of the Himālayas as a Kinnara. His wife was <span class="t18">[4.180] </span><a id="a11211"></a>named Candā.<a id="a11212"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16240"><span class="t9">{954}</span></a> These two dwelt together on a silver mountain named Candapabbata, or the Mountain of the Moon.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11213"></a>At that time the king of Benares had committed his government to his ministers, and all alone dressed in two yellow robes, and armed with the five weapons,<a id="a11214"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16242"><span class="t9">{955}</span></a><a id="a11215"></a> he proceeded to the Himālayas. While eating his venison he remembered where was a little stream, and began to climb the hill. Now the Kinnaras that live on the Mountain of the Moon in the rainy season remain on the mountain, and come down only in the hot weather.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time the Kinnara Canda, with his mate, came down and wandered about, anointing himself with perfumes, eating the pollen of flowers, clothing himself in flower-gauze for inner and outer garments, swinging in the creepers to amuse himself, singing songs in a honey-voice. He too came to this stream; and at one halting-place he went down into it with his wife, scattering flowers about and playing in the water. Then they put on again their garments of flowers, and on a sandy spot white as a silver plate they spread a couch of flowers, and lay there. <span class="t18">{4.284}</span><a id="a11216"></a> Picking up a piece of bamboo, the male Kinnara began to play upon it, and sang with a honey-voice; while his mate waving her soft hands danced nearby and sang withal. The king caught the sound, and treading softly that his footsteps might not be heard, he approached, and stood watching the Kinnaras from a secret place. He immediately fell in love with the female Kinnara. &ldquo;I will shoot the husband,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and kill him, and I will live here with his wife.&rdquo; Then he shot the Kinnara Canda, who lamenting in his pain uttered four verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis passing away, I think, and my blood is flowing, flowing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I am losing my hold on life, O Candā! My breath is going!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &rsquo;Tis sinking, I am in pain, my heart is burning, burning:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But &rsquo;tis for your sorrow, Candā, the heart within me is yearning.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. As grass, as a tree I perish, as a waterless river I dry:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But &rsquo;tis for your sorrow, Candā, my heart within me is yearning.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. As rain on a lake at the mountain foot are the tears that fall from my eye:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But &rsquo;tis for your sorrow, Candā, my heart within me is yearning.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being lament in four verses; and lying upon his couch of flowers, he lost consciousness, and turned away. The king stood where he was. But the other Kinnara did not know that the Great Being was wounded, not even when he uttered his lament, being intoxicated with her own delight. <span class="t18">{4.285}</span> Seeing him lie there turned away and lifeless, she began to wonder what could be the matter with her lord. As she examined him she saw the blood oozing from the mouth of the wound, and being unable to bear the great pain of sorrow for her beloved husband, she <span class="t18">[4.181] </span>cried out with a loud voice. &ldquo;The Kinnara must be dead,&rdquo; thought the king, and he came out and showed himself. When Candā beheld him she thought: &ldquo;This must be the brigand who has slain my dear husband!&rdquo; and trembling she took to flight. Standing upon the hill-top she denounced the king in five verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;That evil prince &ndash; ah, woe is me! &ndash; my husband dear did wound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who there beneath a woodland tree now lies upon the ground.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. O prince! The woe that wrings my heart may your own mother pay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11217"></a><span class="t12">The woe that wrings my heart with my Kimpurisa</span><a id="a11218"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16244"><span class="t19">{956}</span></a><span class="t12"> dead this day!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Yea, prince! The woe that wrings my heart may your own wife repay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The woe that wrings my heart with my Kimpurisa dead this day!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. And may your mother mourn her lord, and may she mourn her son,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who on my lord most innocent for lust this deed have done.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. And may your wife look on and see the loss of lord and son,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For you upon my harmless lord for lust this deed have done.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When she had thus made her lament in these five verses, standing upon the mountain top the king comforted her by another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Weep not nor grieve: the woodland dark has blinded you, I ween:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A royal house shall honour you, and you shall be my queen.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.286}</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;What is this word you have said?&rdquo; cried Candā, when she heard it; and loud as a lion&rsquo;s roar she declaimed the next verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;No! I will surely slay myself! Thine I will never be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who slew innocent Kimpurisa, and all for lust for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When he heard this his passion left him, and he recited another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;Live if you will, O timid one! To the Himālayas go:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11219"></a><span class="t12">Creatures that feed on shrub and tree</span><a id="a11220"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16246"><span class="t19">{957}</span></a><span class="t12"> the woodland love, I know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">With these words he departed indifferent. Candā so soon as she knew him gone came up and, embracing the Great Being, took him up to the hill-top, and laid him on the flat land there: placing his head on her lap, she made a lament in twelve verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;Here in the hills and mountain caves, in many a glen and grot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11221"></a><span class="t12">What shall I do, O Kimpurisa, now that I see you not?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. The wild beasts range, the leaves are spread on many a lovely spot:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. The wild beasts range, sweet flowers are spread on many a lovely spot:</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. Clear run the rivers down the hills, with flowers all overgrown:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What shall I do, O Kimpurisa, now you have left me lone?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. Blue are the Himālaya hills, most fair they are to see:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What shall I do, O Kimpurisa, now that I see you not?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11224"></a>So did she make her lament; and putting the hand of the Great Being on her breast she felt that it still was warm. &ldquo;Canda lives yet!&rdquo; she thought: &ldquo;I will taunt the gods<a id="a11225"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16250"><span class="t9">{959}</span></a> until I bring him to life again!&rdquo; Then she cried aloud, taunting them, &ldquo;Are there none who govern the world? <span class="t18">{4.288}</span> Are they on a journey? Or peradventure they are dead, and therefore save not my dear husband!&rdquo; By the power of her pain Sakka&rsquo;s throne became hot. Pondering he perceived the cause; in the form of a brahmin he approached, and from a waterpot took water and sprinkled the Great Being with it. On the instant the poison ceased to act, his colour returned, he knew not so much as the place where the wound had been: the Great Being stood up quite well. Candā seeing her well-beloved husband to be whole, in joy fell at the feet of Sakka, and sang his praise in the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. &ldquo;Praise, holy brahmin! Who did give unto a hapless wife</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Her well-loved husband, sprinkling him with the elixir of life!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka then gave this advice, &ldquo;From this time forth go not down from the Mountain of the Moon among the paths of men, but abide here.&rdquo; Twice he repeated this, and then returned to his own place. And Candā said to her husband, &ldquo;Why stay here in danger, my lord? Come, let us go to the Mountain of the Moon,&rdquo; reciting the last verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. &ldquo;To the mountain let us go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where the lovely rivers flow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Rivers all o&rsquo;ergrown with flowers:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There for ever, while the breeze</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whispers in a thousand trees,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Charm with talk the happy hours.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: &ldquo;Not only now, but long ago as now, she was devoted and faithful of heart to me.&rdquo; Then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Anuruddha was [Sakka, Devadatta was]</span><a id="a11226"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16252"><span class="t9">{960}</span></a><span class="t30"> the king, Rāhula&rsquo;s mother was Candā, and I myself was the Devatā.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one layman makes friends with everyone, and eventually comes into contact with the Buddha. The latter explains the importance of friendship with a story about a pair of hawks who made friends of the animals around them, who then protected their children when they were hunted.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the lion (sīha),</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a11233"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Friendship, Cooperation, Animals, Birds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;The country churls.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[4.183] </span><span class="t30">This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about Mittagandhaka, a lay brother. </span><span class="t18">{4.289}</span><span class="t30"> This man, they say, the offspring of a decayed family at Sāvatthi, sent a companion to offer marriage to a young gentlewoman. The question was asked, &ldquo;Has he friend or comrade who can dispose of any matter that needs looking to?&rdquo; Reply was made, &ldquo;No, there was none.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then he must make some friends first,&rdquo; they said to him. The man followed this advice, and struck up a friendship with the four gatekeepers. After this he made friends by degrees with the town warders, the astrologers, the nobles of the court, even with the commander-in-chief and the viceroy; and by association with them he became the king&rsquo;s friend, and after that a friend of the eighty chief elders, and through elder Ānanda, with the Tathāgata himself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11234"></a><a id="a11235"></a><span class="t30">Then the Teacher established his family in the Refuges and the Precepts, the king gave him high place, and he was known as Mittagandhaka, the &ldquo;man of many friends.&rdquo;</span><a id="a11236"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16254"><span class="t9">{961}</span></a><span class="t30"> The king bestowed a great house upon him, and caused his nuptial feast to be celebrated, and a world of people from the king downwards sent him gifts. Then his wife received a present sent by the king, and the viceroy&rsquo;s present sent by the viceroy, and the present of the commander-in-chief, and so forth, having all the people of the city bound to her. On the seventh day, with great ceremony the One with Ten Powers was invited by the newly married pair, great gifts were bestowed on the Buddha and his company to the number of five hundred; at the end of the feast they received the Teacher&rsquo;s thanks and were both established in the fruit of the First Path.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11237"></a><span class="t30">In the Dhamma Hall all were talking about it. &ldquo;Monks, the layman Mittagandhaka followed his wife&rsquo;s advice, and by her means became a friend to everyone, and received great honour at the king&rsquo;s hand; and having become friends with the Tathāgata both husband and wife were established in the fruit of the First Path.&rdquo; The Teacher entered and asked what they talked of. They told him. He said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that this man has received great honour by reason of this woman. In days long gone by, when he was an animal, by her advice he made many friends, and was set free from anxiety on a son&rsquo;s behalf.&rdquo; So saying he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, certain men of the marches used to make a settlement, wheresoever they could best find their food, dwelling in the forest, and killing meat for themselves and their families from the game which abounded there. <span class="t18">{4.290}</span><a id="a11238"></a> Not far from their village was a large natural lake, and upon its southward shore lived a hawk, on the west a female hawk; on the north a lion, king of the beasts; on the east an osprey, king of the birds; in the middle dwelt a turtle on a small island. The hawk asked the female hawk to become his wife. She asked him, &ldquo;Have you any friends?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We must have someone who can defend us against any danger or trouble that may arise, and you must find some friends.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whom shall <span class="t18">[4.184]</span> I make friends with?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, with king osprey who lives on the eastern shore, and with the lion on the north, and with the turtle who dwells in the middle of this lake.&rdquo; He took her advice and did so. Then the two lived together (it should be said that on a little islet in the same lake grew a kadamba tree, surrounded by the water on all sides) in a nest which they made.</p>
<p class="p7">Afterwards there were given to them two sons. One day, while the wings of the younglings were yet callow, some of the country folk went foraging through the woods all day and found nothing. Not wishing to return home empty-handed, they went down to the lake to catch a fish or a turtle. They got on the island, and lay down beneath the kadamba tree; and there being tormented by the bites of gnats and mosquitoes, to drive these away, they kindled a fire by rubbing sticks together, and made a smoke. The smoke rising annoyed the birds, and the young ones uttered a cry. &ldquo;It is the cry of birds!&rdquo; said the country folk. &ldquo;Up, make up the fire: we cannot lie here hungry, but before we lie down we will have a meal of fowls&rsquo; flesh.&rdquo; They made the fire blaze, and built it up. But the mother bird hearing the sound, thought: &ldquo;These men wish to eat our young ones. We made friends to save us from that danger. I will send my mate to the great osprey.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.291}</span> Then she said: &ldquo;Go, my husband, tell the osprey of the danger which threatens our young,&rdquo; repeating this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;The country churls build fires upon the isle,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To eat my young ones in a little while:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O hawk! To friend and comrade give the word,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My children&rsquo;s danger tell to every bird!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11239"></a>The bird flew at all speed to the place, and gave a cry to announce his arrival. Leave given, he came near to the osprey, and made his greeting. &ldquo;Why have you come?&rdquo; asked the osprey. Then the bird repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;O wingèd fowl! The chief of birds are thou:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So, osprey king, I seek your shelter now.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Some country-folk hunting now are fain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To eat my young: be you my joy again!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; said the osprey to the hawk, and consoling him he repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;In season, out of season, wise men make</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Both friends and comrades for protection&rsquo;s sake:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For you, O hawk! I will perform this deed;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The good must help each other at their need.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.292}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then he went on to ask, &ldquo;Have the churls climbed up the tree, my friend?&rdquo; &ldquo;They are not climbing yet; they are just piling wood on the fire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then you had better go quickly and comfort my <span class="t18">[4.185] </span><a id="a11240"></a>friend your mate, and say I am coming.&rdquo; He did so. The osprey went also, and from a place near to the kadamba tree he watched for the men to climb, sitting upon a tree-top. Just as one of the boors who was climbing the tree had come near to the nest, the osprey dived into the lake, and from wings and beak sprinkled water over the burning brands, so that they were put out. Down came the men, and made another fire to cook the bird and its young; when they climbed again, once more the osprey demolished the fire. So whenever a fire was made, the bird put it out, and midnight came. The bird was much distressed: the skin under his stomach had become quite thin, his eyes were blood-shot. Seeing him, the hen-bird said to her mate, &ldquo;My lord, the osprey is tired out; go and tell the turtle, that he may have a rest.&rdquo; When he heard this, the bird approaching the osprey, addressed him in a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Good help the good: the necessary deed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You have in pity done for us at need.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Our young are safe, you living: have a care</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of your own self, nor all your strength outwear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing these words, loud as a lion&rsquo;s roar he repeated the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;While I am keeping guard about this tree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I care not if I lose my life for you:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So use the good: thus friend will do for friend:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea, even if he perish at the end.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.293}</span></p>
<p class="p6">But the sixth verse was repeated by the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, as he praised the bird&rsquo;s goodness:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;The egg-born bird that flies the air did a most painful work,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The osprey, guarding well the chicks before the midnight mark.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the hawk said: &ldquo;Rest awhile, friend osprey,&rdquo; and then away to the turtle, whom he aroused. &ldquo;What is your errand, friend?&rdquo; asked the turtle. &ldquo;Such and such a danger has come upon us, and the royal osprey has been labouring hard ever since the first watch, and is very weary; that is why I have come to you.&rdquo; With these words he repeated the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Even they who fall through wrong or evil deed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May rise again if they get help in need.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My young in danger, straight I fly to you:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O dweller in the lake, come, succour me!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the turtle repeated another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;The good man to a man who is his friend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Both food and goods, even life itself, will lend.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For you, O hawk! I will perform this deed:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The good must help each other at their need.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.186]</span></p>
<p class="p6">His son, who lay not far off, hearing the words of his father thought: &ldquo;I would not have my father troubled, but I will do my father&rsquo;s part,&rdquo; and therefore he repeated the ninth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;Here at your ease remain, O father mine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And I your son will do this task of thine. </span><span class="t18">{4.294}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A son should serve a father, so &rsquo;tis best;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ll save the hawk his young ones in the nest.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The father turtle addressed his son in a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;So do the good, my son, and it is true</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That son for father service ought to do.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet they may leave the hawk&rsquo;s young brood alone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Perchance, if they see me so fully grown.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11241"></a>With these words the turtle sent the hawk away, adding, &ldquo;Fear not, my friend, but go you before and I will come presently after.&rdquo; He dived into the water, collected some mud, and went to the island, quenched the flame, and lay still. Then the countrymen cried, &ldquo;Why should we trouble about the young hawks? Let us roll over this cursed<a id="a11242"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16256"><span class="t9">{962}</span></a> turtle, and kill him! He will be enough for all.&rdquo; So they plucked some creepers and got some strings, but when they had made them fast in this place or that, and torn their clothes to strips for the purpose, they could not roll the turtle over. The turtle lugged them along with him and plunged in deep water. The men were so eager to get him that in they fell after: splashed about, and scrambled out with a belly-full of water.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Just look,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;half the night one osprey kept putting out our fire, and now this turtle has made us fall into the water, and swallow it, to our great discomfort. Well, we will light another fire, and at sunrise we will eat those young hawks.&rdquo; Then they began to make a fire. The hen-bird heard the noise they were making, and said: &ldquo;My husband, sooner or later these men will devour our young and depart: you go and tell our friend the lion.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.295}</span> At once he went to the lion, who asked him why he came at such an unseasonable hour. The bird told him all from the beginning, and repeated the eleventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;Mightiest of all the beasts, both beasts and men</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fly to the strongest when beset with fear.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My young ones are in danger; help me then:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You are our king, and therefore I am here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">This said, the lion repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;Yes, I will do this service, hawk, for you:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come, let us go and slay this gang of foes!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Surely the prudent, he who wisdom knows,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Protector of a friend must try to be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Having thus spoken, he dismissed him, saying: &ldquo;Now go, and comfort your young ones.&rdquo; Then he went forward, churning up the crystal water.<span class="t18"> [4.187]</span></p>
<p class="p7">When the churls perceived him approaching, they were frightened to death, &ldquo;The osprey,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;put out our fire-brands; the turtle made us lose the clothes we had on: but now we are done for. This lion will destroy us at once.&rdquo; They ran this way and that: when the lion came to the foot of the tree, nothing could he see. <span class="t18">{4.296}</span> Then the osprey, the hawk, and the turtle came up, and accosted him. He told them the profitableness of friendship, and said: &ldquo;From this time forth be careful never to break the bonds of friendship.&rdquo; With this advice he departed: and they also went each to his own place. The hen-hawk looking upon her young, thought: &ldquo;Ah, through friends have my young been given back to me!&rdquo; and as she rejoiced, she spoke to her mate, and recited six verses declaring the effect of friendship:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;Get friends, a houseful of them without fail,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11243"></a><span class="t12">Get a great friend: a blessing he&rsquo;ll be found:</span><a id="a11244"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16258"><span class="t19">{963}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vain strike the arrows on a coat of mail.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And we rejoice, our younglings safe and sound.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. By their own comrade&rsquo;s help, the friend who stayed to take their part,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">One chirps, the fledglings chirp reply, with notes that charm the heart.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. The wise asks help at friend&rsquo;s or comrade&rsquo;s hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lives happy with his goods and brood of kind:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So I, my mate, and young, together stand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Because our friend to pity was inclined.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. A man needs king and warriors for protection:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And these are his whose friendship is perfection:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You cravest happiness: he is famed and strong;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He surely prospers to whom friends belong.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. Even by the poor and weak, O hawk, good friends must needs be found:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">See now by kindness we and ours each one are safe and sound.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. The bird who wins a hero strong to play a friendly part,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As you and I are happy, hawk, is happy in his heart.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.297}</span></p>
<p class="p6">So she declared the quality of friendship in six verses. And all this company of friends lived all their lives long without breaking the bond of friendship, and then passed away according to their deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11245"></a><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended this discourse, said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that he won to bliss by his wife&rsquo;s means; it was the same before.&rdquo; With these words, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the married pair were the pair of hawks, Rāhula was the young turtle, Moggallāna was the old turtle, Sāriputta the osprey, and I was myself the lion.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a11260"></a><span class="t30">The monks brought to light all the evil parts in the man as they conversed together in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Such a one, monks, after he had dedicated himself to this dispensation which leads to safety, yet lives in deceit!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and would know what they talked of there. They told him. Said he, &ldquo;This is not now the first time; he was deceitful before,&rdquo; and so saying he told a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{4.298}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was family priest, and a wise, learned man was he. On a certain day, he went into his park to disport him, and seeing a beauteous prostitute<a id="a11261"></a> fell in love with her, and took up his abode with her. He got her with child, and when she perceived it she said to him, &ldquo;Sir, I am with child; when he is born, and I am to name him, I will give him his grandfather&rsquo;s name.&rdquo; But he thought: &ldquo;It can never be that the name of a noble family should be given to a slave girl&rsquo;s bastard.&rdquo; Then he said to her, &ldquo;My dear, this tree here is called Uddāla,<a id="a11262"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16264"><span class="t9">{966}</span></a> and you may name the child Uddālaka because he was conceived here.&rdquo; Then he gave her a seal-ring, and said: &ldquo;If it be a girl use this to help bring her up; but if a boy, bring him to me when he grows up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">In due time she brought forth a son, and named him Uddālaka. When he grew up, he asked his mother, &ldquo;Mother, who is my father?&rdquo; &ldquo;The family priest, my boy.&rdquo; &ldquo;If that is so, I will learn the holy books.&rdquo; So receiving the ring from his mother, and a teacher&rsquo;s fee, he journeyed to Taxila and learned there from a world-renowned teacher.</p>
<p class="p7">In the course of his studies he saw a company of ascetics. &ldquo;These must surely have perfect knowledge,&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;I will learn of them.&rdquo; Accordingly he renounced the world, so eager was he for knowledge, and did menial service for them, begging them in return to teach him their own wisdom. So they taught him all they knew; but among the whole five hundred of them not one there was who outdid him in knowledge, he was the wisest of them all. Then they gathered together and appointed him to be their teacher.</p>
<p class="p7">He <span class="t18">[4.189] </span><a id="a11263"></a>said to them, &ldquo;Venerable sirs, you always live in the woodland eating fruits and roots; why do you not go in the paths of men?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;men are willing to give us gifts, but they make us show gratitude by declaring the Dhamma, they ask us questions: for fear of this we go not ever among them.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Sirs, if you have me, let a Universal Monarch ask questions, leave me to settle them, and fear nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So he went on pilgrimage with them, seeking alms, and at last came to Benares, <span class="t18">{4.299}</span> and stayed in the king&rsquo;s park. Next day, in company with them all, he sought alms in a village before the city gate. The folk gave them alms in plenty. On the day following the ascetics traversed the city, the folk gave them alms in plenty. The ascetic Uddālaka gave thanks, and blessed them, and answered questions. The people were edified, and gave all they had need of in great abundance.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11264"></a>The whole city buzzed with the news, &lsquo;A wise teacher is come, a holy ascetic,&rsquo; and the king got wind of it.&rdquo; Where do they live?&rdquo; asked the king. They told him, &ldquo;In the park.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this day I will go and see them.&rdquo; A man went and told it to Uddālaka, saying: &ldquo;The king is to come and see you today.&rdquo; He called the company together, and said: &ldquo;Sirs, the king is coming: win favour in the eyes of the great for one day, it is enough for a lifetime.&rdquo; &ldquo;What must we do, teacher?&rdquo; they asked. Then he said: &ldquo;Some of you must be at the swinging penance,<a id="a11265"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16266"><span class="t9">{967}</span></a><a id="a11266"></a> some squat on the ground,<a id="a11267"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16268"><span class="t9">{968}</span></a><a id="a11268"></a> some lie upon beds of spikes, some practise the penance of the five fires,<a id="a11269"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16270"><span class="t9">{969}</span></a> others go down into the water, others again recite holy verses in this place or that.&rdquo; They did as he bade. Himself with wise men eight or ten sat upon a prepared seat with a head-rest disputing, a fair volume beside him laid upon a beautiful writing dish, and listeners all around.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11270"></a>At that moment the king with his family priest and a great company came into the park, and when he saw them all deep in their sham austerities, he was pleased and thought: &ldquo;They are free from all fear of evil states hereafter.&rdquo; Approaching Uddālaka, he greeted him graciously and sat down on one side; then in the delight of his heart began speaking to the family priest, and recited the first verse:<a id="a11271"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16272"><span class="t9">{970}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;With uncleansed teeth, and goatskin garb and hair</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All matted, muttering holy words in peace:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Surely no human means to good they spare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Surely they know the truth, have won release.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.190] {4.300}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, the family priest replied, &ldquo;The king is pleased where he should not be pleased, and I must not be silent.&rdquo; Then he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;A learned sage may do ill deeds, O king:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A learned sage may fail to follow right.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A thousand Vedas will not safety bring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Failing just works, or save from evil plight.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Uddālaka, when he heard these words thought to himself, &ldquo;The king was pleased with the ascetics, be they what you will; but this man comes a clap over the snout of the ox when he goes too fast, drops dirt in the dish all ready to eat: I must talk to him.&rdquo; So he addressed to him the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;A thousand Vedas will not safety bring</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Failing just works, or save from evil plight:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The Vedas then, must be a useless thing:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">True Dhamma is &ndash; control yourself, do right.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.301}</span></p>
<p class="p6">At this the family priest recited the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Not so: the Vedas are no useless thing:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Through works with self-control, true Dhamma is.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To study well the Vedas fame will bring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But by right conduct we attain to bliss.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now thought Uddālaka, &ldquo;It will never do to be on ill terms with this man. If I tell him I am his son, he needs must love me; I will tell him I am his son.&rdquo; Then he recited the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Parents and kinsmen claim one&rsquo;s care;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A second self our parents are:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;m Uddālaka, a shoot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Noble brahmin, from your root.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;Are you indeed Uddālaka?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other. Then he said: &ldquo;I gave your mother a token, where is it?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Here it is, brahmin,&rdquo; and handed him the ring. The brahmin knew the ring again, and said: &ldquo;Without doubt you are a brahmin; but do you know the duties of a brahmin?&rdquo; He enquired concerning these duties in the words of the sixth verse: <span class="t18">{4.302}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;What makes the brahmin? How can he be perfect? Tell me this:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What is a righteous man, and how wins he Nibbāna&rsquo;s bliss?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Uddālaka explained it in the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;The world renounced, with fire, he worship pays,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pours water, lifts the sacrificial pole:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As one who does his duty men him praise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And such a brahmin wins him peace of soul.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The family priest listened to his account of the brahmin&rsquo;s duties, but found fault with it, reciting the eighth verse as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Not sprinkling makes the brahmin pure, perfection is not this,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor peace nor kindness thus he wins nor yet Nibbāna&rsquo;s bliss.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.191]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hereupon Uddālaka asked, &ldquo;If this does not make the brahmin, then what does?&rdquo; reciting the ninth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;What makes the brahmin? How can he be perfect? Tell me this:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What is a righteous man? And how wins he Nibbāna&rsquo;s bliss?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.303}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The family priest answered by reciting another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;He has no field, no goods, no wish, no kin,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Careless of life, no sensual desires, no evil ways:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Even such a brahmin peace of soul shall win,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So as one true to duty men him praise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After this Uddālaka recited a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11272"></a><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;Khattiya, Brahmin, Vessa, Sudda, and Outcaste, Pukkusa,</span><a id="a11273"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16274"><span class="t19">{971}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All these can be compassionate, can win Nibbāna&rsquo;s bliss:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who among all the saints is there who worse or better is?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the brahmin recited a verse, to show that there is no higher or lower from the moment he has become an Arahat:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;Khattiya, Brahmin, Vessa, Sudda, and Outcaste, Pukkusa,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All these can be compassionate, can win Nibbāna&rsquo;s bliss:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">None among all the saints is found who worse or better is.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But Uddālaka found fault with this, reciting a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11274"></a><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;Khattiya, Brahmin, Vessa, Sudda, and Outcaste, Pukkusa,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All these can virtuous be, and all attain Nibbāna&rsquo;s bliss:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. None among all the saints is found who worse or better is.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You are a brahmin, then, for nought: vain is your rank, I wis.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.304}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Here the family priest recited two verses more, with a similitude:</p>

The circumstances will appear under the Kusajātaka [Ja 531]. </span><span class="t18">{4.305}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This was a tale the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told about a discontented monk. The story tells that he was of noble birth and lived at Sāvatthi, and on his heartily embracing the dispensation he adopted the ascetic life. Now one day as he was going his rounds for alms in Sāvatthi, he met a fair lady and fell in love with her at first sight. Overcome by his passion he lived an unhappy life, and letting his nails and hair grow long and wearing soiled robes, he pined away and became quite sallow, with all his veins standing out on his body. And just as in the Deva world, the Devaputtas who are destined to fall from their heavenly existence manifest five well-known signs, that is to say, their garlands wither, their robes soil, their bodies grow ill-favoured, perspiration pours from their armpits, and they no longer find pleasure in their Deva home, so too in the case of worldly monks, who fall from the Dhamma, the same five signs are to be seen: the flowers of faith wither, the robes of righteousness soil, through discontent and the effects of an evil name their persons grow ill-favoured, the sweat of corruption streams from them and they no longer delight in a life of solitude at the foot of forest trees &ndash; all these signs were to be found in him. So they brought him into the presence of the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;Venerable sir, this fellow is discontented.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Here again the Teacher asked, &ldquo;Is it true, monk, that you are discontent?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir, it is true.&rdquo; &ldquo;For what cause?&rdquo; &ldquo;For lust&rsquo;s sake, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monk why are you discontent, after embracing such a faith as this which leads to safety; and all for lust&rsquo;s sake? In days of yore, before the Buddha arose, wise men who took to the ascetic life, even they who were ordained in an outside sect, made an oath, and renounced a suggested idea connected with temptations or desires!&rdquo; So saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as the son of a great brahmin householder who owned a fortune of eighty crores of money. The name they gave him was my lord Mahākañcana [Great Gold]. At the time when he could but just go upon his feet, another son was born to the brahmin, and they called him my lord Upakañcana [Lesser Gold]. Thus in succession seven sons came, and youngest of all came a daughter, whom they named Kañcanadevī [Lady Gold].</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11287"></a><a id="a11288"></a>Mahākañcana, when he grew up, studied at Taxila all the arts and sciences, and returned home. Then his parents desired to establish him in a household of his own. &ldquo;We will fetch you,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;a girl from a family to be a fit match for you, and then you shall have your own household.&rdquo; But he said: &ldquo;Mother and father, I want no household. To me the three realms of existence<a id="a11289"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16276"><span class="t9">{972}</span></a> are terrible as fires, beset with chains like a prison-house, loathsome as a dunghill. Never have I known of the deed of kind, not so much as in a dream. You have other sons, bid them be heads of families and leave me alone.&rdquo; Though they begged him again and again, sent his friends to him and besought him by their lips, yet he would have none of it.</p>
<p class="p7">Then his friends asked him, &ldquo;What do you wish, my good friend, that you care nothing for the enjoying of love and desire?&rdquo; He told them how he had renounced all the world. When the parents understood this, they made the like proposal to the other sons, but none of them would hear of it; nor yet again did the lady Kañcanā.</p>
<p class="p7">By and by the parents died. The wise Mahākañcana did the obsequies for his parents; with the treasure of eighty crores he distributed <span class="t18">[4.193] </span>alms munificently to beggars and wayfaring men; then taking with him his six brothers, his sister, a servant man and handmaiden, and one companion, <span class="t18">{4.306}</span> he made his renunciation and retired into the region of the Himālayas. There in a delightful spot near a lotus-lake they built them a hermitage, and lived a holy life eating of the fruits and roots of the forest.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11290"></a>When they went into the forest, they went one by one, and if ever one of them saw a fruit or a leaf he would call the rest: there telling all they had seen and heard, they picked up what there was &ndash; it seemed like a village market. But the teacher, the ascetic Mahākañcana, thought to himself, &ldquo;We have cast aside a fortune of eighty crores and taken up the ascetic life, and to go about greedily seeking for wild fruits is not seemly. From henceforth I will bring the wild fruits by myself.&rdquo; Returning then to the hermitage, in the evening he gathered all together and told them his thought. &ldquo;You remain here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and practise the life of the recluse, I will fetch fruit for you.&rdquo; Thereat Upakañcana and all the rest broke in, &ldquo;We have become ascetics under your wing, it is you who should stay behind and practise the life of the recluse. Let our sister remain here also, and the maid be with her: we eight will take turns to fetch the fruit, but you three shall be free from taking a turn.&rdquo; He agreed.</p>
<p class="p7">Thenceforward these eight took a turn to bring in fruit one at a time: the others each received his share of the find, and carried it off to his dwelling-place and remained in his own leaf-hut. Thus they could not be together without cause or reason. He whose turn it was would bring in the provender (there was one enclosure), and laying it on a flat stone would make eleven portions of it; then making the gong sound he would take his own portion and depart to his place of dwelling; the others coming up at the gong-sound, without hustling, but with all due ceremony and order, would take each his allotted portion of the find, then returning to his own place there would eat it, and resume his meditation and austerity. After a time they gathered lotus fibres and ate them, and there they lived, mortifying themselves with scorching heat and other kind of torments, their senses all dead, striving to focus on the Meditation Object.</p>
<p class="p7">By the glory of their virtue Sakka&rsquo;s throne trembled. &ldquo;Are these released from desire only,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or are they sages? <span class="t18">{4.307}</span><a id="a11291"></a> I will find out now.&rdquo; So by his supernatural power for three days he caused the Great Being&rsquo;s share to disappear. On the first day, seeing no share for him, he thought: &ldquo;My share must have been forgotten.&rdquo; On the second day,&rdquo; There must be some fault in me:<a id="a11292"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16278"><span class="t9">{973}</span></a> he has not provided my share in the way of due respect.&rdquo; On the third, &ldquo;Why can it be they provide no share for me? If there be fault in me I will make my peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So at evening he sounded upon <span class="t18">[4.194] </span>the gong. They all came together, and asked who had sounded the gong. &ldquo;I did, my brothers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, good master?&rdquo; &ldquo;My brothers, who brought in the food three days ago?&rdquo; One uprose, and said: &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; standing in all respect. &ldquo;When you made the division did you set apart a share for me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why yes, master, the share of the eldest.&rdquo; &ldquo;And who brought food yesterday?&rdquo; Another rose, and said: &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; then stood respectfully waiting. &ldquo;Did you remember me?&rdquo; &ldquo;I put by for you the share of the eldest.&rdquo; &ldquo;Today who brought the food?&rdquo; Another arose, and stood respectfully waiting. &ldquo;Did you remember me in making the division?&rdquo; &ldquo;I set aside the share of the eldest for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11293"></a>Then he said: &ldquo;Monks, this is the third day I have had no share. The first day when I saw none, I thought, &lsquo;Doubtless he that made the division has forgotten my share.&rsquo; The second day, I thought &lsquo;There must be some fault in me.&rsquo; But today I made up my mind, that if fault there were, I would make my peace, and therefore I summoned you by the sound of this gong. You tell me you have put aside for me these portions of the lotus fibres: I have had none of them. I must find out who has stolen and eaten these. When one has forsaken the world and all the sensual desires thereof, theft is unseemly, be it no more than a lotus-stalk.&rdquo; When they heard these words, they cried out, <span class="t18">{4.308}</span> &ldquo;Oh what a cruel deed!&rdquo; and they were all much agitated.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11294"></a><a id="a11295"></a>Now the Devatā which dwelt in a tree by that hermitage, the chief tree of the forest, came out and sat down in their midst. There was likewise an elephant, which had been unable under his training to be impassible, and brake the stake he was bound to, and escaped into the woods: from time to time he used to come and salute the band of sages, and now he came also and stood on one side. A monkey also there was, that had been used to make sport with serpents, and had escaped out of the snake-charmer&rsquo;s hands into the forest: he dwelt in that hermitage, and that day he also greeted the band of ascetics, and stood on one side. Sakka, resolved to test the ascetics, was there also in a shape invisible beside them. At that moment the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s younger brother, the recluse Upakañcana, arose from his seat, and saluting the Bodhisatta, with a bow to the rest of the company, said as follows, &ldquo;Teacher, setting aside the rest, may I clear myself from this charge?&rdquo; &ldquo;You may, brother.&rdquo; He, standing in the midst of the sages, said: &ldquo;If I ate those fibres of yours, such and such am I,&rdquo; making a solemn oath in the words of the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;May horse and kine be his, may silver, gold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A loving wife, these may he precious hold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May he have sons and daughters manifold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11296"></a><span class="t12">Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.&rdquo;</span><a id="a11297"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16280"><span class="t19">{974}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">[4.195]</span></p>
<p class="p6">On this the ascetics put their hands over their ears, crying, &ldquo;No, no, sir, that oath is very heavy!&rdquo; And the Bodhisatta also said: &ldquo;Monk, your oath is very heavy: you did not eat the food, sit down on your pallet.&rdquo; He having thus made his oath and sat down, up rose the second brother, and saluting the Great Being, recited the second verse to clear himself: <span class="t18">{4.309}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;May he have sons and raiment at his will,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Garlands and sandal sweet his hands may fill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His heart be fierce with lust and longing still,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When he sat down, the others each in his turn uttered his own verse to express his feeling:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;May he have plenty, win both fame and land,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sons, houses, treasures, all at his command,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The passing years may he not understand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;As mighty warrior chief may he be known,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Be he a brahmin, passion unsubdued,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brahmin, who stole your share of food away.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.312}</span></p>
<p class="p6">When oath had been taken in these thirteen verses, the Great Being thought: &ldquo;Perhaps they imagine I am lying myself, and saying that the food was not there when it was.&rdquo; So he made oath on his part in the fourteenth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;Who swears the food was gone, if it was not,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let him enjoy desire and its effect,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May worldly death be at the last his lot.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The same for you, sirs, if you now suspect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the sages had made their oath thus, Sakka thought to himself, &ldquo;Fear nothing; I made these lotus fibres disappear in order to test these men, and they all make oath, loathing the deed as if it were a snot of spittle. Now I will ask them why they loathe lust and desire.&rdquo; This question he put by questioning the Bodhisatta in the next verse, after having assumed a visible form:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;What in the world men go seeking here</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That thing to many lovely is and dear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Longed-for, delightful in this life: why, then,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Have saints no praise for things desired of men?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">By way of answer to this question, the Great Being recited two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;Desires are deadly blows and chains to bind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In these both misery and fear we find:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11314"></a><span class="t12">When tempted by desires imperial kings</span><a id="a11315"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16298"><span class="t19">{983}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Infatuate do vile and sinful things.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. These sinners bring forth wrong, to hell they go</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At dissolution of this mortal frame. </span><span class="t18">{4.313}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11316"></a><span class="t12">Because the misery of lust they know</span><a id="a11317"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16300"><span class="t19">{984}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Therefore saints praise not lust, but only blame.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.197]</span></p>
<p class="p6">When Sakka had heard the Great Being&rsquo;s explanation, much moved in heart he repeated the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. &ldquo;Myself to test these sages stole away</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That food, which by the lake-side I did lay.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sages they are indeed and pure and good.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O man of holy life, behold your food!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing which the Bodhisatta recited a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. &ldquo;We are no tumblers, to make sport for you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No kinsmen nor no friends of thine are we.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then why, O king divine, O thousand-eyed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Think you the sages must your sport provide?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And Sakka recited the twentieth verse, making his peace with him:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. &ldquo;You are my teacher, and my father thou,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From my offence let this protect me now.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Forgive me my one error, O wise sage!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They who are wise are never fierce in rage.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.314}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being forgave Sakka, King of the Devas, and on his own part to reconcile him with the company of sages recited another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. &ldquo;Happy for holy men one night has been,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When the Lord Vāsava by us was seen.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And, sirs, be happy all in heart to see</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The food once stolen now restored to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka saluted the company of sages, and returned to the world of gods. And they caused the Absorptions and Super Knowledges to spring up within them, and became destined for the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: &ldquo;Thus, monks, wise men of old made an oath and renounced wrong.&rdquo; This said, he declared the Truths. At the conclusion of the Truths, the discontented monk was established in the fruit of the First Path. Identifying the Jātaka, he recited three verses:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11318"></a><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;Sāriputta, Moggallāna, Puṇṇa, Kassapa, and I,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Anuruddha and Ānanda then the seven brothers were.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. Uppalavaṇṇā was the sister, and Khujjuttarā the maid,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sātāgira was the spirit, Citta householder the slave,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. The elephant was Pārileyya, Madhuvāseṭṭha was the ape,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kāḷudāyi then was Sakka. Now you understand the Jātaka.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
