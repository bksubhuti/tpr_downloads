<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one newly ordained monk doesn&rsquo;t like to carry out his duties and wants to go his own way. The Buddha tells a story of an obstinate ascetic who kept a pet elephant, against the advice of his teacher, and was duly killed by it.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a3329"></a><a id="a3330"></a><a id="a3331"></a><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told at Jetavana concerning a disobedient monk. He was, they say, of gentle birth, and though ordained in the dispensation that leads to safety, was admonished by his well-wishers, masters, teachers, and fellow-students to this effect, &ldquo;Thus must you advance and thus retreat; thus look at or away from objects; thus must the arm be stretched out or drawn back; thus are the inner and outer garment to be worn; thus is the bowl to be held, and when you have received sufficient food to sustain life, after self-examination, thus are you to partake of it, keeping guard over the door of the senses; in eating you are to be moderate and exercise watchfulness; you are to recognize such and such duties towards monks who come to or go from the monastery; these are the fourteen sets of monastic duties, and the eighty great duties to be duly performed; these are the thirteen ascetic practices; all these are to be scrupulously performed.&rdquo; Yet was he disobedient and impatient, and did not receive instruction respectfully, but refused to listen to them, saying: &ldquo;I do not find fault with you. Why do you speak thus to me? I shall know what is for my good, and what is not.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then the monks, hearing of his disobedience, sat in the Dhamma Hall, telling of his faults. The Teacher came and asked them what it was they were discussing, and sent for the monk and said: &ldquo;Is it true, monk, that you are disobedient?&rdquo; And he confessed that it was so.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3332"></a><span class="t30">The Teacher said to this monk, &ldquo;In olden days, as now, you were wilful and careless of wise men&rsquo;s advice, and you were trampled to death by a mad elephant because of it.&rdquo; And he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born of a brahmin family. On growing up he left his worldly home and took to the ascetic life, and in time became the leader of a company of five hundred ascetics, who all lived together in the region of the Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">Amongst these ascetics was a wilful and unteachable person named Indasamānagotta. He had a pet elephant. The Bodhisatta sent for him when he found this out, and asked if he really did keep a young elephant? Yes, the man said, he had an elephant which had lost its dam. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the Bodhisatta said, &ldquo;when elephants grow up they kill even those who foster them; so you had better not keep it any longer.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t live without him, my teacher!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll live to repent it.&rdquo; Howbeit he still reared the creature, and by and by it grew to an immense size.</p>
<p class="p7">It happened once that the ascetics had all gone far afield to gather roots and fruits in the forest, and they were absent for several days. At the first breath of the south wind this elephant fell in a frenzy.<span class="t18"> [2.29]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Destruction to this hut!&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll smash the water-jar! I&rsquo;ll overturn the stone bench! I&rsquo;ll tear up the pallet! I&rsquo;ll kill the ascetic, and then off I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; So he sped into the jungle, and waited watching for their return.</p>
<p class="p7">The master came first, <span class="t18">{2.42}</span><a id="a3333"></a> laden with food for his pet. As soon as he saw him, he hastened up, thinking all was well.<a id="a3334"></a><a href="notes.html#a15029"><span class="t9">{385}</span></a> Out rushed the elephant from the thicket, and seizing him in his trunk, dashed him to the ground, then with a blow on the head crushed the life out of him; and madly trumpeting, he scampered into the forest.</p>
<p class="p7">The other ascetics brought this news to the Bodhisatta. Said he, &ldquo;We should have no dealings with the bad,&rdquo; and then he repeated these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Na santhavaṁ kāpurisena kayirā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ariyo anariyena&nbsp; pajānam-atthaṁ.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cirānuvuttho pi karoti pāpaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gajo yathā Indasamānagottaṁ.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Have no intimacy with a bad person, the noble know the worth of the ignoble. Eventually he does what is wicked, like the elephant to Indasamāna.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Yaṁ tveva jaññā: Sadiso maman-ti,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sīlena paññāya sutena cāpi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Teneva mettiṁ kayirātha saddhiṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sukho have sappurisena saṅgamo ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">But he of whom you know: He is like I, having virtue and wisdom and learning, with him one should certainly be friendly, happy is the meeting with a good person. </span><span class="t18">{2.43}</span></p>
<p class="p23">In this way the Bodhisatta showed his band of ascetics that it is well to be docile and not obstinate. Then he performed Indasamānagotta&rsquo;s obsequies, and cultivating the Divine Abidings, came at last into Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After concluding this discourse, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;This unruly fellow was then Indasamānagotta, and I was myself the teacher of the ascetic band.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the heretics practice all sorts of austerities, including worshipping the sacred fire, in hope of sanctity, but the Buddha says it is all to no effect, and tells a story of the past in which an ascetic with much trouble built a hut and worshipped the fire until one day it burnt down his dwelling, at which point he abandoned the practice and went to the Himālayas.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the ascetic (tāpasa).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Nothing is worse.&rdquo;</span><a id="a3340"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about feeding the sacred fire. The circumstances are the same as those of the Naṅguṭṭhajātaka [Ja 144] related above.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3341"></a><span class="t34">This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, touching the false austerity of the Ājīvikas, or naked ascetics. Tradition tells us that behind Jetavana they used to practise false austerities. A number of the monks saw them there painfully squatting on their heels, swinging in the air like bats, reclining on thorns, scorching themselves with five fires, and so forth in their various false austerities.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks, on seeing those who kept up the fires, said to the Fortunate One, &ldquo;Sir, here are topknot ascetics practising all sorts of false asceticism. What&rsquo;s the good of it?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no </span><span class="t18">[2.30] </span><span class="t30">good in it,&rdquo; said the Teacher. &ldquo;It has happened before that even wise men have imagined some good in feeding the sacred fire, but after doing this for a long time, have found out that there is no good in it, and have quenched it with water, and beat it down, beat it down with sticks, never giving it so much as a look afterwards.&rdquo; Then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3342"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family. When he was about sixteen years old, his father and mother took his birth-fire<a id="a3343"></a><a href="notes.html#a15031"><span class="t9">{386}</span></a> and spoke to him thus, &ldquo;Son, will you take your birth-fire into the woods, and worship the fire there; or will you learn the Three Vedas, settle down as a married man, and live in the world?&rdquo; Said he, &ldquo;No worldly life for me: I will worship my fire in the woodland, and go on the way to heaven.&rdquo; So taking his birth-fire, he bade farewell to his parents, and entered the forest, where he lived in a hut made of branches and leaves and worshipped the fire.</p>
<p class="p7">One day he had been invited to some place where he received a present of rice and ghee. &ldquo;This rice,&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;I will offer to Mahābrahmā.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.44}</span> So he took home the rice, and made the fire blaze. Then with the words, &ldquo;With this rice I feed the sacred flame,&rdquo; he cast it upon the fire. Scarce had this rice dropped upon it, all full of fat as it was &ndash; when a fierce flame leapt up which set his hermitage alight. Then the brahmin hurried away in terror, and sat down some distance off. &ldquo;There should be no dealings with the wicked,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and so this fire has burnt the hut which I made with so much trouble!&rdquo; And he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Na santhavasmā paramatthi pāpiyo</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yo santhavo kāpurisena hoti.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Santappito sappinā pāyasena</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kicchākataṁ paṇṇakuṭiṁ adayhī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Nothing is worse than the intimacy of one intimate with a bad person. The fire that burned with ghee and with milk-rice burned down my leaf-hut, made with much trouble.</span></p>
<p class="p23">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done with you now, false friend!&rdquo; he added; and he poured water upon the fire, and beat it out with sticks, and then buried himself in the mountains. There he came upon a black deer licking the faces of a lion, a tiger, and a panther. This put it into his mind how there was nothing better than good friends; and therewith he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Na santhavasmā paramatthi seyyo</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yo santhavo sappurisena hoti.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sīhassă vyagghassa ca dīpino ca</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sāmā mukhaṁ lehati santhavenā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Nothing is better than intimacy of one intimate with a good person. </span><span class="t18">{2.45} </span><span class="t4">The lion&rsquo;s, tiger&rsquo;s and leopard&rsquo;s face the Sambar deer licks intimately. </span><span class="t18">[2.31]</span></p>
<p class="p23">With these reflections the Bodhisatta plunged into the depths of the mountains, and there he embraced the true ascetic life, cultivating the Super Knowledges and Attainments, until at his life&rsquo;s end he passed into Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After delivering this discourse, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;In those days I was the ascetic of the story.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present laymen decide on giving a gift to the Buddha, and the heretics, although they do not like it, cannot prevent it. The Buddha tells a story of how, in ancient times, a youth had learned the Vedas and elephant lore in one night, so as to be able to fulfil his duties, and sustain his family&rsquo;s income, which the brahmins tried to take from them.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the young brahmin (māṇava),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Five score black elephants.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about arbitrary giving of alms.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">We hear that at Sāvatthi, a family used sometimes to give alms to the Buddha and his disciples, sometimes they used to give to the heretics, or else the givers would form themselves into companies, or again the people of one street would club together, or the whole of the inhabitants would collect voluntary offerings, and present them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On this occasion all the inhabitants had made such a collection of all necessaries; but counsels were divided, some demanding that this be given to the heretics, some speaking for those who followed the Buddha. Each party stuck to their point, the disciples of the heretics voting for the heretics, and the disciples of Buddha for Buddha&rsquo;s company. Then it was proposed to divide upon the question, and accordingly they divided; those who were for the Buddha were in the majority.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So their plan was followed, and the disciples of the heretics could not prevent the gifts being offered to the Buddha and his followers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The citizens gave invitation to the Buddha&rsquo;s company; for seven days they set rich offerings before them, and on the seventh gave over all the articles they had collected. The Teacher returned thanks, </span><span class="t18">{2.46}</span><span class="t30"> after which he instructed a host of people in the fruition of the Paths. Next he returned to Jetavana; and when his followers had done their duties, he delivered a Sugata&rsquo;s discourse standing before his scented chamber, into which he then retired.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At evening time the monks talked the matter over together in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Friend, how the heretics&rsquo; disciples tried to prevent this from coming to the saints! Yet they couldn&rsquo;t do it; all the collection of articles was laid before the saints&rsquo; own feet. Ah, how great is the Buddha&rsquo;s power!&rdquo; &ldquo;What is this you are talking about now together?&rdquo; asked the Teacher, coming in. They told him. &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is not the first time that the disciples of the heretics have tried to thwart an offering which should have been made to me. They did the same before; but always these articles have been finally laid at my feet.&rdquo; So saying, he told them a tale of long ago. </span><span class="t18">[2.32]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past there lived in Benares a king Susīma; and the Bodhisatta was the son of his family priest&rsquo;s lady. When he was sixteen years old, his father died. The father while he lived was Teacher of the Ceremonies in the king&rsquo;s elephant festivals. He alone had right to all the trappings and appointments of the elephants which came into the place of festival. By this means he gained as much as ten millions at each festival.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3351"></a>At the time of our story the season for an elephant festival came round. And the brahmins all flocked to the king, with these words, &ldquo;O great king! The season for an elephant festival has come, and a festival should be made. But this your family priest&rsquo;s son is very young; he knows neither the three Vedas nor the lore of elephants.<a id="a3352"></a><a href="notes.html#a15033"><span class="t9">{387}</span></a> Shall we conduct the ceremony?&rdquo; To this the king consented.</p>
<p class="p7">Off went the brahmins delighted. &ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we have barred this lad from performing the festival. We shall do it ourselves, and keep the gains!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">But the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s mother heard that in four days there was to be an elephant festival. <span class="t18">{2.47}</span> &ldquo;For seven generations,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;we have managed the elephant festivals from father to son. The old custom will pass from us, and our wealth will all melt away!&rdquo; She wept and wailed. &ldquo;Why are you weeping?&rdquo; asked her son. She told him. Said he, &ldquo;Well, mother, shall I conduct the festival?&rdquo; &ldquo;What, you, sonny? You don&rsquo;t know the three Vedas or the elephant lore; how can you do it?&rdquo; &ldquo;When are they going to have the festival, mother?&rdquo; &ldquo;Four days from now, my son.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where can I find teachers who know the three Vedas by heart, and all the elephant lore?&rdquo; &ldquo;Just such a famous teacher, my son, lives in Taxila, in the realm of Gandhāra, two thousand leagues away.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;our hereditary right we shall not lose. One day will take me to Taxila; one night will be enough to teach me the three Vedas and the elephant lore; on the morrow I will journey home; and on the fourth day I will manage the elephant festival. Weep no more!&rdquo; With these words he comforted his mother.</p>
<p class="p7">Early next morning he broke his fast, and set out all alone for Taxila, which he reached in a single day. Then seeking out the teacher, he greeted him and sat on one side. &ldquo;Where have you come from?&rdquo; the teacher asked. &ldquo;From Benares, Teacher.&rdquo; &ldquo;To what end?&rdquo; &ldquo;To learn from you the three Vedas and the elephant lore.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly, my son, you shall learn it.&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.33]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said our Bodhisatta, &ldquo;my case is urgent.&rdquo; Then he recounted the whole matter, adding, &ldquo;In a single day I have traversed a journey of two thousand leagues. Give me your time for this one night only. Three days from now there is to be an elephant festival; I will learn the whole after one lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher consented. Then the lad washed his master&rsquo;s feet, and laid before him a fee of a thousand pieces of money; <span class="t18">{2.48}</span> he sat down on one side, and learned his lesson by heart; even as the day broke, he finished the three Vedas and the elephant lore. &ldquo;Is there any more, sir?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;No, my son, you have it all.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;in this book such a verse comes in too late, such another has gone astray in the reading. This is the way to teach your pupils for the future,&rdquo; and then he corrected his teacher&rsquo;s knowledge for him.</p>
<p class="p7">After an early meal he took his leave, and in a single day he was back again in Benares, and greeting his mother. &ldquo;Have you learned your lesson, my boy?&rdquo; said she. He answered, yes; and she was delighted to hear it.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day, the festival of the elephants was prepared. A hundred elephants were set in array, with golden trappings, golden flags, all covered with a network of fine gold; and all the palace courtyard was decked out. There stood the brahmins, in all their fine gala dress, thinking to themselves, &ldquo;Now we shall do the ceremony, we shall do it!&rdquo; Presently came the king, in all his splendour, and with him the ornaments and other things that were used.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta, apparelled like a prince, at the head of his suite, approached the king with these words.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Is it really true, O great king, that you are going to rob me of my right? Are you going to give other brahmins the managing of this ceremony? Have you said that you mean to give them the various ornaments and vessels that are used?&rdquo; and he repeated the first verse as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Kāḷā migā setadantā tavīme,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Parosataṁ hemajālābhichannā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Te te dadāmī,&rsquo; ti Susīma brūsi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Anussaraṁ pettipitāmahānaṁ.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">These black creatures, who are white tusked, are yours, over a hundred, covered over with gold, &lsquo;I give these to you,&rsquo; said king Susīma, in remembrance of my dead ancestors. </span><span class="t18">{2.49}</span></p>
<p class="p23">King Susīma, thus addressed, then repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Kāḷā migā setadantā mamīme,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Parosataṁ hemajālābhicchannā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Te te dadāmī,&rsquo; ti vadāmi māṇava,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Anussaraṁ pettipitāmahānaṁ.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">These black creatures, who are white tusked, are mine, over a hundred, covered over with gold, &lsquo;I give these to you,&rsquo; said king Susīma, in remembrance of my dead ancestors.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Then a thought struck the Bodhisatta; and he said: &ldquo;Sire, if you do remember my ancient right and your ancient custom, why do you neglect me and make others the masters of your festival?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, I <span class="t18">[2.34] </span>was told that you did not know the three Vedas or the elephant lore, and that is why I have caused the festival to be managed by others.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, sire. If there is one amongst all these brahmins who can recite a portion of the Vedas or the elephant lore against me, let him stand forward! Not in all Jambudīpa is there one save me who knows the three Vedas and the elephant lore for the ordering of an elephant festival!&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.50}</span> Proud as a lion&rsquo;s roar rang out the answer! Not a brahmin did rise and contend with him. So the Bodhisatta kept his ancestral right, and conducted the ceremony; and laden with riches, he returned to his own home.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, some entered on the First Path, some on the Second, some the Third, and some the Fourth. &ldquo;Mahāmāyā was at that time my mother, king Suddhodana was my father, Ānanda was king Susīma, Sāriputta the famous Teacher and I myself was the young brahmin.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a3366"></a><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain monk who supported his mother. They say that there was a wealthy merchant at Sāvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, he exclaimed that he would go too.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the Tathāgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parents&rsquo; consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then he thought to himself, &ldquo;I live here distracted &ndash; it is not suitable for me,&rdquo; and he became anxious to reach the goal of spiritual insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the son&rsquo;s place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, &ldquo;Tell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchant&rsquo;s family in Sāvatthi.&rdquo; &ldquo;O friend, don&rsquo;t ask for news of that family.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;They say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When he heard the other&rsquo;s words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, &ldquo;O sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;they are my own father and mother, I am their son.&rdquo; &ldquo;O friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you &ndash; do you go and take care of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;For twelve years,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;I have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit: I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t34">heaven.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from Sāvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to Sāvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: &ldquo;Shall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?&rdquo; Then he said to himself, &ldquo;In old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.&rdquo; So he left the road to Sāvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3367"></a><a id="a3368"></a><span class="t34">Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the Mātiposakasutta [SN 7.19]. As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: &ldquo;If I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, &lsquo;A son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,&rsquo; I went away before without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.&rdquo; So he took his ticket and his ticket-food and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to Sāvatthi and he thought to himself, &ldquo;Shall I first get the gruel or see my parents?&rdquo; He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their round for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, &ldquo;We have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.&rdquo; When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At last the father said to the mother, &ldquo;Go to him; can this be your son?&rdquo; She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: &ldquo;Do not grieve, I will support you,&rdquo; so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, &ldquo;Your complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale &ndash; has some illness come upon you?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;No illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,&rdquo; and he told them the history. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;the Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.&rdquo; When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;So and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher asked him whether he, a monk, was really supporting persons who were still living in the world. This the monk admitted, &ldquo;How are they related to you?&rdquo; the Teacher went on. &ldquo;They are my parents, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Excellent, excellent,&rdquo; the Teacher said; and bade the monks not be angry with this monk. &ldquo;Wise men of old,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have done service even to those who were not of kin to them; but this man&rsquo;s task has been to support his own parents.&rdquo; So saying, he told them this story of bygone days.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a young vulture on Vulture Peak, and had his mother and father to nourish. <span class="t18">[2.35]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3369"></a>Once there came a great wind and rain. The vultures could not hold their own against it; half frozen, they flew to Benares, and there near the wall and near the ditch they sat, shivering with the cold.</p>
<p class="p7">A merchant of Benares was issuing from the city on his way to bathe, when he spied these miserable vultures. He got them together in a dry place, made a fire, sent and brought them some cowflesh from the cattle&rsquo;s burning-place, and put someone to look after them.</p>
<p class="p7">When the storm fell, <span class="t18">{2.51}</span> our vultures were all right and flew off at once among the mountains. Without delay they met, and thus took counsel together. &ldquo;A Benares merchant has done us a good turn; and one good turn deserves another, as the saying is:<a id="a3370"></a><a href="notes.html#a15035"><span class="t9">{388}</span></a> so after this when any of us finds a garment or an ornament it must be dropped in that merchant&rsquo;s courtyard.&rdquo; So thenceforward if they ever noticed people drying their clothes or finery in the sun, watching for an unwary moment, they snatched them quickly, as hawks swoop on a bit of meat, and dropped them in the merchant&rsquo;s yard. But he, whenever he observed that they were bringing him anything, used to cause it to be laid aside.</p>
<p class="p7">They told the king how vultures were plundering the city. &ldquo;Just catch me one vulture,&rdquo; says the king, &ldquo;and I will make them bring it all back.&rdquo; So snares and traps were set everywhere; our dutiful vulture was caught. They seized him with intent to bring him to the king. The merchant aforesaid, on the way to wait upon his majesty, saw these people walking along with the vulture. He went in their company, for fear they might hurt the vulture. They gave the vulture to the king, who examined him.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3371"></a>&ldquo;You rob our city, and carry off clothes and all sorts of things,&rdquo; he began.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whom have they been given to?&rdquo; &ldquo;A merchant of Benares.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because he saved our lives, and they say one good turn deserves another; that is why we gave them to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Vultures, they say,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;can spy a corpse a hundred leagues away; and can&rsquo;t you see a trap set ready for you?&rdquo; And with these words he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Yaṁ nu gijjho yojanasataṁ kuṇapāni avekkhati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kasmā jālañ-ca pāsañ-ca āsajjā pi na bujjhasī ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">It is known a vulture can see corpses a hundred leagues away, why did you not know after arriving at the net and the snare? </span><span class="t18">{2.52}</span></p>
<p class="p23">The vulture listened, then replied by repeating the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Yadā parābhavo hoti poso jīvitasaṅkhaye,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Atha jālañ-ca pāsañ-ca āsajjā pi na bujjhati.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">When a creature is in decline and life is coming to an end, then he does not know after arriving at the net and the snare.</span></p>
<p class="p23">After this response of the vulture, the king turned to our merchant. &ldquo;Have all these things really been brought to you, then, by the vultures?&rdquo;<span class="t18"> [2.36]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, they are all put away; each shall receive his own again &ndash; only let this vulture go!&rdquo; He had his way; the vulture was set at liberty, and the merchant returned all the property to its owners.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This lesson ended, the Teacher declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the dutiful monk was established in the fruition of the First Path, &ldquo;Ānanda was the king of those days; Sāriputta was the merchant; and I myself was the vulture that supported his parents.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a3379"></a><span class="t34">Tradition tells how two soldiers, in the service of the king of Kosala, of high rank, and great persons at court, no sooner caught sight of one another than they used to exchange ill words. Neither king, nor friends, nor kinsfolk could make them agree.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3380"></a><span class="t34">It happened one day that early in the morning the Teacher, looking around to see which of his friends were ripe for release, perceived that these two were ready to enter upon the First Path. Next day he went all alone seeking alms in Sāvatthi, and stopped before the door of one of them, who came out and took the Teacher&rsquo;s bowl; then led him within, and offered him a seat. The Teacher sat, and then enlarged on the profit of cultivating loving-kindness. When he saw the man&rsquo;s mind was ready, he declared the Truths. This done, the other was established in the Fruit of the First Path. Seeing this, the Teacher persuaded him to take the bowl; then rising he proceeded to the house of the other. Out came the other, and after salutation given, begged the Teacher to enter, and gave him a seat. He also took the Teacher&rsquo;s bowl, and entered along with him. To him the Teacher lauded the Eleven Blessings of Loving-kindness; and perceiving that his heart was ready, declared the Truths. And this done, he too became established in the Fruit of the First Path.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Thus they were both converted; they confessed their faults one to the other, and asked forgiveness; peaceful and harmonious, they were at one together. That very same day they ate together in the presence of the Fortunate One.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">His meal over, the Teacher returned to the monastery. They both returned with him, bearing a rich present of flowers, scents and perfumes, of ghee, honey, and sugar. The Teacher, having preached of duty before the Saṅgha, and uttered a Sugata&rsquo;s discourse, retired to his scented chamber.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Next morning, the monks talked the matter over in the Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; one would say to another, &ldquo;our Teacher subdues the unsubdued.</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t34">Why, here are these two grand persons, who have been quarrelling all this time, and could not be reconciled by the king himself, or friends and kinsfolk: and the Tathāgata has humbled them in a single day!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, &ldquo;What are you talking about,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;as you sit here together?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Here, as before, the Teacher said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, these two nobles have been reconciled by me; in former times I reconciled them too.&rdquo; Then he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a certain village as one of a brahmin family. When he came of age, <span class="t18">{2.53}</span> he was educated at Taxila; then, renouncing the world he became a recluse, cultivated the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and dwelt in the region of the Himālayas, living upon wild roots and fruits which he picked up in his goings to and fro.</p>
<p class="p7">At the end of his cloistered walk lived a mongoose in an ant-heap; and not far off, a snake lived in a hollow tree. These two, snake and mongoose, were perpetually quarrelling. The Bodhisatta preached to them the misery of quarrels and the blessing of peace, and reconciled the two together, saying: &ldquo;You ought to cease your quarrelling and live together at one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">When the serpent was abroad, the mongoose at the end of the walk lay with his head out of the hole in his ant-hill, and his mouth open, and <span class="t18">[2.37] </span>thus fell asleep, heavily drawing his breath in and out. The Bodhisatta saw him sleeping there, and asking him, &ldquo;Why, what are you afraid of?&rdquo; repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Sandhiṁ katvā amittena aṇḍajena jalābuja,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vivariya dāṭhaṁ sesi, kuto te bhayam-āgatan-ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Womb-born one, having made peace with your enemy, the egg-born one, you sleep with your teeth uncovered, what is it you have come to fear?</span></p>
<p class="p23">&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said the mongoose, &ldquo;never despise a former enemy, but always suspect him,&rdquo; and he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3381"></a><a id="a3382"></a><span class="t12">2. Saṅketheva amittasmiṁ, mittasmim-pi na vissase,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3383"></a><span class="t12">Abhayā bhayam-uppannaṁ api mūlāni kantatī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a3384"></a><a id="a3385"></a><a id="a3386"></a><a id="a3387"></a><span class="t4">Make agreements with enemies, do not have confidence in friends, a fear arising from what is not fearful cuts off all the roots. </span><span class="t18">{2.54}</span></p>
<p class="p23">&ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; replied the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;I have persuaded the snake to do you no harm; distrust him no more.&rdquo; With this advice, he proceeded to cultivate the four Divine Abidings, and set his face toward Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm. And the others too passed away to fare hereafter according to their deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then this lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The two noblemen were at that time snake and mongoose, and I was myself the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a3395"></a><span class="t15">In the present a brahmin is concerned that the place where he will be cremated is pure, and no outcaste had been cremated there before him.

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Fourteen thousand Upasāḷhas.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while at Jetavana, about a brahmin named Upasāḷha, who was fastidious in the matter of cemeteries.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This man, we learn, was rich and wealthy; but, though he lived over against the monastery, he showed no kindness to the Buddhas, being given to heresy. But he had a son, wise and intelligent. When he was growing old, the man said to his son, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let my body be burnt in a cemetery where any outcaste can be burnt, but find some uncontaminated place to burn me in.&rdquo; &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said the young fellow, &ldquo;I know no cemetery fit to burn your body in. My father, take the lead and point out the place where I shall have you burnt.&rdquo; So the brahmin consenting led his son out of the city to the top of Vulture Peak, and then said he, &ldquo;Here, my son, no outcaste is ever burnt; here I would have you burn me.&rdquo; Then he began to descend the hill in his son&rsquo;s company.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On that day, in the evening, the Teacher was looking around to see which of his friends was ripe for release, and perceived that this father and son were </span><span class="t18">[2.38] </span><span class="t30">ready to enter upon the First Path. So he took their road, and came to the foot of the hill, like a hunter waiting for his quarry; there he sat till they should come down from the top. Down they came, and noticed the Teacher. He gave them greeting, and asked, &ldquo;Where are you bound, brahmins?&rdquo; The young man told him their errand. &ldquo;Come along, then,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;show me the place your father pointed out.&rdquo; So he and they two together climbed up the mountain. &ldquo;Which place?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the lad, &ldquo;the space between these three hills is the one he showed me.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{2.55}</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, my lad, that your father has been nice in the matter of cemeteries; he was the same before. Nor is it only now that he has pointed you out this place for his burning; long ago he pointed out the very same place.&rdquo; And at his request the Teacher told them a tale of long ago.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3397"></a>In the past, in this very city of Rājagaha, lived this same brahmin Upasāḷhaka,<a id="a3398"></a><a href="notes.html#a15037"><span class="t9">{389}</span></a> and he had the very same son. At that period the Bodhisatta had been born in a brahmin family of Magadha land; and when his education was finished, he embraced an ascetic life, cultivated the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and lived a long time in the region of the Himālayas, plunged in mystic exaltation.</p>
<p class="p7">Once he left his hermitage on Vulture Peak to go buy salt and seasoning. While he was away, this brahmin spoke in just the same way to his son, as now. The lad begged him to point out a proper place, and he came and pointed out this very place. As he was descending, with his son, he observed the Bodhisatta, and approached him, and the Bodhisatta put the same question as I did just now, and received the son&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see whether this place which your father has shown you is contaminated or not,&rdquo; and made them go with him up the hill again. &ldquo;The space between these three hills,&rdquo; said the lad, &ldquo;is pure.&rdquo; &ldquo;My lad,&rdquo; the Bodhisatta replied, &ldquo;there is no end to the people who have been burned in this very spot. Your own father, born a brahmin, as now, in Rājagaha, and bearing the very same name of Upasāḷhaka, has been burnt on this hill in fourteen thousand births. On the whole earth there&rsquo;s not a spot to be found where a corpse has not been burnt, which has not been a cemetery, which has not been covered with skulls.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">This he discerned by the faculty of knowing all previous lives: and then he repeated these two verses: <span class="t18">{2.56}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Upasāḷakanāmāni sahassāni catuddasa</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Asmiṁ padese daḍḍhāni, natthi loke anāmataṁ.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">There are fourteen thousand people named Upasāḷaka who were burned in this place, there is no place on earth unaffected by death.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Yamhi saccañ-ca Dhammo ca, ahiṁsā saṁyamo damo,</span></p>

<p class="p23">When the Bodhisatta had thus discoursed to father and son, he cultivated the four Divine Abidings and went his way to Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths father and son were established in the Fruit of the First Path. &ldquo;The father and son were the same then as they are now, and the ascetic was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the Devadhītā = the same in the past (Devadhītā).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a3403"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Temptation, Asceticism, Devas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Begging monk, do you know.&rdquo;</span><a id="a3404"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while he was staying in Tapoda Park near Rājagaha, about elder Samiddhi [Goodluck].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Once venerable Samiddhi had been wrestling in the spirit all night long. At sunrise he bathed; then he stood with his under garment on, holding the other in his hand, as he dried his body, all yellow as gold. Like a golden statue of exquisite workmanship he was, the perfection of beauty; </span><span class="t18">{2.57}</span><span class="t30"> and that is why he was called Samiddhi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3405"></a><a id="a3406"></a><span class="t30">A Devadhītā, seeing the elder&rsquo;s surpassing beauty, fell in love with him, and addressed him thus. &ldquo;You are young, monk, and fresh, a mere stripling, with black hair, bless you! You have youth, you are lovely and pleasant to the eyes. Why should a man like you turn ascetic without a little enjoyment? Take your pleasure first, and then you shall become ascetic and do what the ascetics do!&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Nymph, at some time or other I must die, and the time of my death I know not; that time is hid from me. Therefore in the freshness of my youth I will follow the solitary life, and make an end of suffering.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3407"></a><span class="t30">Finding she received no encouragement, the Devadhītā at once vanished. The elder went and told his Teacher about it. Then the Teacher said: &ldquo;Not now alone, Samiddhi, are you tempted by a Devadhītā. In olden days, as now, Devadhītā tempted ascetics.&rdquo; And then at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta became a brahmin&rsquo;s son in a village of Kāsi. Coming of years, he attained perfection in all his studies, and embraced the ascetic life; and he lived in the Himālayas, nearby a natural lake, cultivating the Super Knowledges and Attainments. <span class="t18">[2.40]</span></p>
<p class="p7">All night long he had wrestled in the spirit; and at sunrise he bathed himself, and with one bark garment on and the other in his hand, he stood, letting the water dry off his body. At that moment a Devadhītā observed his perfect beauty, and fell in love with him. Tempting him, she repeated this first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3408"></a><a id="a3409"></a><a id="a3410"></a><a id="a3411"></a><span class="t12">1. Abhutvā bhikkhasi bhikkhu, na hi bhutvāna bhikkhasi,</span></p>

<p class="p23">The Bodhisatta listened to the Devatā&rsquo;s address, and then replied, declaring his set purpose, by repeating the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3422"></a><a id="a3423"></a><span class="t12">2. Kālaṁ vohaṁ na jānāmi, channo kālo, na dissati,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a3425"></a><a id="a3426"></a><a id="a3427"></a><a id="a3428"></a><span class="t4">I do not know the time, the time is hidden, and not visible, so, without enjoying, I seek alms, and don&rsquo;t let time pass me by.</span></p>
<p class="p23">When the Devadhītā heard the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s words, she vanished at once.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After this discourse the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The Devadhītā is the same in both stories, and the ascetic at that time was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the Buddha teaches the monks a discourse outlining their proper objectives, and what to avoid. He then tells a story of the past in which a quail was caught by a falcon, but managed to escape him when on home ground.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day the Teacher called the monks, saying: &ldquo;When you seek alms, monks, keep each to your own district.&rdquo; And repeating that Discourse from the Mahāvagga which suited the occasion, </span><span class="t18">{2.59}</span><span class="t30"> he added, &ldquo;But wait a moment: previously others even in the form of animals refused to keep to their own </span><span class="t18">[2.41] </span><span class="t30">districts, and by poaching on other people&rsquo;s preserves, they fell into the way of their enemies, and then by their own intelligence and resource got free from the hands of their enemies.&rdquo; With these words he related a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta came into the world as a young quail. He got his food in hopping about over the clods left after ploughing.</p>
<p class="p7">One day he thought he would leave his feeding ground and try another; so off he flew to the edge of a forest. As he picked up his food there, a falcon spied him, and attacking him fiercely, he caught him fast.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3437"></a>Held prisoner by this falcon, our quail moaned, &ldquo;Ah! How very unlucky I am! How little sense I have! I&rsquo;m poaching on Someone else&rsquo;s preserves! O that I had kept to my own place, where my fathers were before me! Then this falcon would have been no match for me, I mean if he had come to fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why, quail, says the falcon, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your own ground, where your fathers fed before you?&rdquo; &ldquo;A ploughed field all covered with clods!&rdquo; At this the falcon, relaxing his strength, let go. &ldquo;Off with you, quail! You won&rsquo;t escape me, even there!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The quail flew back and perched on an immense clod, and there he stood, calling, &ldquo;Come along now, falcon!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Straining every nerve, poising both wings, down swooped the falcon fiercely upon our quail, &ldquo;Here he comes with a vengeance!&rdquo; thought the quail; and as soon as he saw him in full career, just turned over and let him strike full against the clod of earth. The falcon could not stop himself, and struck his breast against the earth; this broke his heart, and he fell dead with his eyes starting out of his head. <span class="t18">{2.60}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3438"></a><a id="a3439"></a><span class="t30">When this tale had been told, the Teacher added, &ldquo;Thus you see, monks, how even animals fall into their enemies&rsquo; hands by leaving their proper place; but when they keep to it, they conquer their enemies. Therefore do you take care not to leave your own place and intrude upon another&rsquo;s. O monks, when people leave their own station Māra</span><a id="a3440"></a><a href="notes.html#a15041"><span class="t9">{391}</span></a><a id="a3441"></a><span class="t30"> finds a door, Māra gets a foothold.

<p class="p23"><a id="a3450"></a><span class="t30">When he had thus perished, out came the quail, exclaiming, &ldquo;I have seen the back of my enemy!&rdquo; and perching upon his enemy&rsquo;s breast, he gave voice to his exalted utterance in the words of the second verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3451"></a><a id="a3452"></a><a id="a3453"></a><span class="t12">2. Sohaṁ nayena sampanno, pettike gocare rato,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a3455"></a><span class="t4">Having succeeded with my plan, I delight in my fathers&rsquo; grounds, now rid of my foe I rejoice, considering my own welfare.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">This discourse at an end, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka.

<p class="p7"><a id="a3465"></a><span class="t30">On one occasion the Teacher thus addressed the Saṅgha, &ldquo;Monks, loving-kindness practised with all devotion of thought, </span><span class="t18">{2.61}</span><span class="t30"> meditated upon, increased, made a vehicle of progress, made your one object, practised, well begun, may be expected to produce Eleven Blessings.</span><a id="a3466"></a><a href="notes.html#a15045"><span class="t9">{393}</span></a><a id="a3467"></a><span class="t30"> What are these eleven?

Loving-kindness, monks, practised with renunciation of one&rsquo;s wishes&rdquo; and so forth, &ldquo;may be expected to produce these Eleven Blessings. Praising the loving-kindness which holds these Eleven Blessings, monks, a monk ought to show kindness to all creatures, whether expressly commanded or not, he should be a friend to the friendly, aye a friend to the unfriendly, and a friend to the indifferent: thus to all without distinction, whether expressly bidden or not, he should show loving-kindness: he should show sympathy with joy and sorrow and practise equanimity; he should do his work by means of the four Divine Abidings. By so doing he will go to Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm even without Path or Fruit. Wise men of old by cultivating loving-kindness for seven years, have dwelt in Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm seven ages, each with its one period to wax and one to wane.&rdquo;</span><a id="a3468"></a><a href="notes.html#a15047"><span class="t9">{394}</span></a><span class="t30"> And he told them a story. </span><span class="t18">[2.43]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, in a former age, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin&rsquo;s family. When he grew up, he forsook his sensual desires and embraced the ascetic life, and attained the four Divine Abidings. His name was Araka, and he became a Teacher, and lived in the Himālayas region, with a large body of followers. Admonishing his band of sages, he said: &ldquo;A recluse must show loving-kindness, sympathetic must he be both in joy and sorrow, and full of equanimity; for this thought of loving-kindness attained by resolve prepares him for Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm.&rdquo; And explaining the blessing of loving-kindness, he repeated these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3469"></a><a id="a3470"></a><span class="t12">1. Yo ve mettena cittena, sabbalokānukampati,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><a id="a3479"></a><a id="a3480"></a><span class="t12">2. Appamāṇaṁ hitaṁ cittaṁ, paripuṇṇaṁ subhāvitaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p23">Thus did the Bodhisatta discourse to his pupils on the practice of loving-kindness and its blessings. And without a moment&rsquo;s interruption of his Absorption, he was reborn in the Brahmā Realm, and for seven ages, each with his time to wax and wane, he came no more to this world.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After finishing this discourse, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The band of sages of that time are now the Buddha&rsquo;s followers; and I myself am he that was the Teacher Araka.&rdquo;</span></p>

The king seeing this asked, &ldquo;What is he doing, wise sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Paying respect to you, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;If so, let not his service be without reward; give him a largess.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, a largess is of no use to him; all he wants is something to eat.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what does he eat?&rdquo; &ldquo;Meat, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;How much ought he to have?&rdquo; &ldquo;A farthing&rsquo;s worth, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;A farthing&rsquo;s worth is no gift from a king,&rdquo; said the king, and he sent a man with orders to bring regularly and give to the chameleon a half-anna&rsquo;s worth of meat. This was done thereafter. But on a fast day, when there is no killing, the man could find no meat; so he bored a hole through the half-anna piece, and strung it upon a thread, and tied it upon the chameleon&rsquo;s neck. This made the creature proud. That day the king again went into the park; but the chameleon as he saw the king draw near, in pride of wealth made himself equal to the king, thinking within himself, &ldquo;You may be very rich, Vedeha, but so am I.&rdquo; So he did not come down, but lay still on the archway, stroking his head. The king seeing this said: &ldquo;Wise sir, this creature does not come down today as usual; what is the reason?&rdquo; And he recited the first verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">1. Nāyaṁ pure unnamati toraṇagge kakaṇṭako,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Mahosadha vijānāhi, kena thaddho kakaṇṭako ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t43">Previously this chameleon on the archway was not proud, explain Mahosadha, why is that chameleon now haughty.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t11">The sage perceived that the man must have been unable to find meat on this fast day when there was no killing, and that the creature must have become proud because of the coin hung about his neck; so he recited this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3502"></a><a id="a3503"></a><a id="a3504"></a><span class="t25">2. Aladdhapubbaṁ laddhāna, aḍḍhamāsaṁ kakaṇṭako,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><span class="t43">The chameleon got what he didn&rsquo;t have before, a small coin, he despises the king of Videha of the house of Mithilā.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t11">The king sent for the man and questioned him, and he told him all about it truly. Then he was more than ever pleased with the sage, who (it seemed) knew the thoughts of the chameleon, without asking any questions, with a wisdom like the supreme wisdom of a Buddha; so he gave him the revenue taken at the four gates. Being angry with the chameleon, he thought of discontinuing the gift, but the sage told him that it was unfitting and dissuaded him.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">It is said that there was a householder in Sāvatthi, one of the faithful, a true believer, who had fled to the Three Refuges, endowed with the Five Precepts. One day he set out to listen to the Teacher at Jetavana, bearing plenteous ghee and condiments of all sorts, flowers, perfumes, etc. At the same time, his wife&rsquo;s mother started to visit her daughter, and brought a present of solid food and gruel. She was a little hard of hearing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3514"></a><a id="a3515"></a><span class="t30">After dinner &ndash; one feels a little drowsy after a meal &ndash; she said, by way of keeping herself awake, &ldquo;Well, and does your husband live happily with you? Do you agree together?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, mother, what a thing to ask! You could hardly find a holy ascetic who is so good and virtuous as he!&rdquo; The good woman did not quite take in what her daughter said, but she caught the word, &ldquo;Ascetic&rdquo; and cried she, &ldquo;O dear, why has your husband turned ascetic!&rdquo; and a great to-do she made. Everybody who lived in that house heard it, and cried, &ldquo;News &ndash; the householder has turned ascetic!&rdquo; People heard the noise, and a crowd gathered at the door to find out what it was. &ldquo;The householder who lives here has turned ascetic!&rdquo; was all they heard.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Our householder listened to the One with Ten Power&rsquo;s sermon, then left the monastery to return to the city.

A lucky speech must not be neglected; this day an ascetic I must be.&rdquo; Then and there he turned right round, and went back to the Teacher. &ldquo;You paid your visit to the Buddha,&rdquo; the Teacher said, &ldquo;and went away. What brings you back here again?&rdquo; The man told him about it, adding, &ldquo;A lucky speech, sir, must not be neglected. So here I am, and I wish to become an ascetic.&rdquo; Then he received the lesser and the greater orders, and lived a good life; and very soon he became an Arahat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The story got known amongst the Saṅgha. One day they were discussing it all together in the Dhamma Hall, on this fashion, &ldquo;I say, friend, householder So-and-so took orders because he said &lsquo;a lucky speech must never be neglected,&rsquo; and now he has became an Arahat!&rdquo; The Teacher came in and wanted to know what it was they were talking about. They told him. Said he, &ldquo;Monks, wise men in days long past also went forth because they said that a lucky speech must never be neglected,&rdquo; and then he told them a story of olden days.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta came into the world as a rich merchant&rsquo;s son; and when he grew up and his father died he took his father&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p class="p7">Once he had gone to pay his respects to the king: and his mother-in-law came on a visit to her daughter. She was a little hard of hearing, and all happened just as it has happened above. The husband was on <span class="t18">[2.45] </span>his way back from paying his respects to the king, when he was met by a man, who said: &ldquo;They say you have turned ascetic, and there&rsquo;s such a hullabaloo in your house!&rdquo; The Bodhisatta, thinking that lucky words must never be neglected, turned right round and went back to the king. The king asked what brought him back again. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;all my people are bewailing me, I am told, because I have turned ascetic, when I have done nothing of the kind. But lucky words must not be neglected, and an ascetic I will be. I crave your permission to become an ascetic!&rdquo; And he explained the circumstances by the following verses: <span class="t18">{2.65}</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Who is it with a mighty cry.&rdquo;</span><a id="a3565"></a><a id="a3566"></a><span class="t30"> This is a story which the Teacher told at Jetavana about one Kokālika. At this time we hear that there were a number of very learned monks in the district of Manosilā, who spoke out like young lions, loud enough to bring down the heavenly Ganges,</span><a id="a3567"></a><a href="notes.html#a15049"><span class="t9">{395}</span></a><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{2.66}</span><a id="a3568"></a><span class="t30"> while reciting passages of scripture before the Saṅgha. As they recited their texts, Kokālika (not knowing what an empty fool he showed himself) thought he would like to do the same. So he went about among the monks saying: &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t ask me to recite a piece of scripture. If </span><span class="t18">[2.46] </span><a id="a3569"></a><span class="t30">they were to ask me, I would do it.&rdquo; All the Saṅgha got to know of it and they thought they would try him. &ldquo;Friend Kokālika,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;give the Saṅgha a recital of some scriptures today.&rdquo; To this he agreed, not knowing his folly; that day he would recite before the Saṅgha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">He first partook of gruel made to his liking, ate some food, and had some of his favourite soup. At sundown the gong sounded for sermon time; all the Saṅgha gathered together. The &lsquo;yellow robe&rsquo; which he put on was blue as a bluebell; his outer robe was pure white. Thus clad, he entered the meeting, greeted the elders, stepped up to a Dhamma Seat under a grand jewelled pavilion, holding an elegantly carved fan, and sat down, ready to begin his recitation. But just at that moment beads of sweat began to start out all over him, and he felt ashamed. The first verse of the first verse he repeated; but what came next he could not think. So rising from the seat in confusion, he passed out through the meeting, and sought his own cell. Someone else, a real scholar, recited the scripture. After that all the monks knew how empty he was.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day the monks fell a talking of it in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Friend, it was not easy to see formerly how empty Kokālika is; but now he has given tongue of his own accord, and shown it.&rdquo; The Teacher entered, and asked what they were discussing together. They told him. He said: &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time Kokālika has betrayed himself by his voice; the very same thing happened before,&rdquo; and then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as a young lion, <span class="t18">{2.67}</span> and was the king of many lions. With a suite of lions he dwelt in Silver Cave. Near by was a jackal, living in another cave.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, after a shower of rain, all the lions were together at the entrance of their leader&rsquo;s cave, roaring loudly and gambolling about as lions do. As they were thus roaring and playing, the jackal too lifted up his voice. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s this jackal, giving tongue along with us!&rdquo; said the lions; they felt ashamed, and were silent. When they all fell silent, the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s cub asked him this question. &ldquo;Father, all these lions that were roaring and playing about have fallen silent for very shame on hearing that creature. What creature is it that betrays itself thus by its voice?&rdquo; and he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Ko nu saddena mahatā, abhinādeti Daddaraṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Taṁ sīhā nappaṭinadanti, ko nāmeso migādhibhū ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Who is it, with a great noise, that resounds on the mount Daddara. The lions no longer cry out, what is his name, lord of the beasts?</span></p>
<p class="p23">At his son&rsquo;s words the old lion repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3570"></a><a id="a3571"></a><span class="t12">2. Adhamo migajātānaṁ siṅgālo tāta vassati,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a3577"></a><span class="t4">The jackal, my dear, the meanest who lives amongst those born as beasts, completely disgusted by his kind, the lions sit in silence.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; the Teacher added, &ldquo; &rsquo;tis not the first time Kokālika has betrayed himself by his voice; it was just the same before,&rdquo; and bringing his discourse to an end, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Kokālika was the jackal, Rāhula was the young lion, and I was myself the lion king.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a3587"></a><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about a dishonest monk. This man, even though dedicated to the dispensation that leads to safety, notwithstanding to gain life&rsquo;s necessaries fulfilled the threefold cheating practice [seeking requisites, seeking honour and hinting].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3588"></a><span class="t34">The monks brought to light all the evil parts in the man as they conversed together in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Such a one, monks, after he had dedicated himself to this dispensation which leads to safety, yet lives in deceit!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and would know what they talked of there. They told him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Here too the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, not this once only has the fellow turned out a rogue; in days of yore, when he was a monkey, he played tricks for the sake of a fire.&rdquo; And he told a tale of days long gone by.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family in a village of Kāsi. When he came of years, he received his education at Taxila, and settled down in life.</p>
<p class="p7">His lady in time bore him a son; and when the child could just run to and fro, she died. The husband performed her obsequies, and then, said he, &ldquo;What is home to me now? I and my son will live the life of ascetics.&rdquo; Leaving his friends and kindred in tears, he took the lad to the Himālayas, became an ascetic, and lived on the fruits and roots which the forest yielded.</p>
<p class="p7">On a day during the rainy season, when there had been a downpour, he kindled some sticks, and lay down on a pallet, warming himself at the fire. And his son sat beside him massaging his feet.</p>
<p class="p7">Now a wild monkey, miserable with cold, spied the fire in the leaf-hut of our ascetic. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;suppose I go in: they&rsquo;ll cry out monkey! monkey! and beat me back: I shan&rsquo;t get a chance of warming myself. I have it!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get an ascetic&rsquo;s dress, and get inside by a trick!&rdquo; So he put on the bark dress of a dead ascetic, lifted his basket and crooked stick, and took his stand by the hut door, where he crouched down beside a palm tree. The lad saw him, and cried to his father (not knowing he was a monkey) &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an old ascetic, sure enough, miserably cold, come to warm himself at the fire.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.69}</span> Then he addressed his father in the words of the first verse, begging him to let the poor fellow in to warm himself:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3589"></a><a id="a3590"></a><a id="a3591"></a><a id="a3592"></a><span class="t12">1. Tāta māṇavako eso, tālamūlaṁ apassito,</span></p>

<p class="p23">When the Bodhisatta heard this, up he got and went to the door. But when he saw the creature was only a monkey, he said: &ldquo;My son, men have no such face as that; &rsquo;tis a monkey, and he must not be asked in here.&rdquo; Then he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3600"></a><a id="a3601"></a><span class="t12">2. Mā kho tvaṁ tāta pakkosi, dūseyya no agārakaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p23">The Bodhisatta seized a brand, crying, &ldquo;What do you want there?&rdquo; threw it at him, and drove him away. The monkey dropped his bark garments, sprang up a tree, and buried himself in the forest.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the Bodhisatta cultivated the four Divine Abidings until he came unto Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3606"></a><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;This tricky monk was the monkey of those days; Rāhula</span><a id="a3607"></a><a href="notes.html#a15051"><span class="t9">{396}</span></a><span class="t30"> was the ascetic&rsquo;s son, and I myself was the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Devadatta&rsquo;s lack of gratitude is notorious amongst the monks. The Buddha tells a story about a previous life in which he helped a thirsty monkey, only for the monkey to make his droppings fall on the head of his benefactor.</span></p>

One day it happened that the monks were talking in the Dhamma Hall about Devadatta&rsquo;s ingratitude and treachery to his friends, when the Teacher broke in, &ldquo;Not this once only, monks, has Devadatta been ungrateful and treacherous to his own friends. He was just the same before.&rdquo; Then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a brahmin family in a certain Kāsi village, and when he grew of age, married and settled down. Now in those days there was a certain deep well by the highway in Kāsi, which had no way <span class="t18">[2.49] </span>down to it. The people who passed by that way, to win merit, used to draw water by a long rope and a bucket, and fill a trough for the animals; thus they gave the animals water to drink. All around lay a mighty forest, wherein troops of monkeys dwelt.</p>
<p class="p7">It happened by a chance that for two or three days the supply of water which wayfarers used to draw ceased; and the creatures could get nothing to drink. A monkey, tormented with thirst, walked up and down by the well looking for water.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the Bodhisatta came that way on some errand, drew water for himself, drank it, and washed his hands; then he noticed our monkey. Seeing how thirsty he was, the traveller drew water from the well and filled the trough for him. Then he sat down under a tree, to see what the creature would do.</p>
<p class="p7">The monkey drank, sat down near, and pulled a monkey-grimace, to frighten the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;Ah, you bad monkey!&rdquo; said he, at this, &ldquo;when you were thirsty and miserable, <span class="t18">{2.71}</span> I gave you plenty of water; and now you make monkey-faces at me. Well, well, help a rascal and you waste your pains.&rdquo; And he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3614"></a><a id="a3615"></a><a id="a3616"></a><a id="a3617"></a><span class="t12">1. Adamha te vāri pahūtarūpaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a3622"></a><a id="a3623"></a><a id="a3624"></a><span class="t4">I have given you plenty of water, when you were scorched by heat, and were thirsty. Now, having drunk, you are chattering away, it&rsquo;s best to be detached from bad people.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Then this spiteful monkey replied, &ldquo;I suppose you think that&rsquo;s all I can do. Now I&rsquo;ll drop something on your head before I go.&rdquo; Then, repeating the second verse, he went on:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3625"></a><span class="t12">2. Ko te suto vā diṭṭho vā sīlavā nāma makkaṭo?</span></p>

<p class="p23">As soon as he heard this the Bodhisatta got up to go. But at the very instant this monkey from the branch where he sat dropped it like a festoon upon his head; and then made off into the forest shrieking. The Bodhisatta washed, and went his way. <span class="t18">{2.72}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, after saying: &ldquo;It is not only now that Devadatta is so, but in former days also he would not acknowledge a kindness which I showed him,&rdquo; he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Devadatta was the monkey then, and the brahmin was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7">There for a long time he abode; until once in need of salt and seasoning, he came down from the highlands to a border village, where he stayed in a leaf-hut. When they were absent seeking alms, a mischievous monkey used to enter the hermitage, and turn everything upside down, spill the water out of the jars, smash the jugs, and finish by making a mess in the cell where the fire was.</p>
<p class="p7">The rains over, the ascetics thought of returning, and took leave of the villagers, &ldquo;For now,&rdquo; they thought, &ldquo;the flowers and fruit are ripening on the mountains.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;we will come to your dwelling with our alms; you shall eat before you go.&rdquo; So next day they brought there plenty of food, solid and liquid. The monkey thought to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trick these people and cajole them into giving me some food too.&rdquo; So he put on the air of a holy man seeking alms, <span class="t18">{2.73}</span> and close by the ascetics he stood, worshipping the sun. When the people saw him, they thought: &ldquo;Holy are they who live with the holy,&rdquo; and repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3642"></a><a id="a3643"></a><span class="t12">1. Sabbesu kira bhūtesu santi sīlasamāhitā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3644"></a><a id="a3645"></a><a id="a3646"></a><a id="a3647"></a><a id="a3648"></a><span class="t12">Passa sākhāmigaṁ jammaṁ, ādiccam-upatiṭṭhatī ti!</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a3649"></a><a id="a3650"></a><a id="a3651"></a><a id="a3652"></a><a id="a3653"></a><span class="t4">It seems that amongst all the creatures there are those endowed with virtue, see this contemptible monkey, who is worshipping the sun-god!</span></p>
<p class="p23">After this fashion the people praised our monkey&rsquo;s virtues. But the Bodhisatta, observing it, replied, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the ways of a mischievous monkey, or you would not praise one who little deserves praise,&rdquo; adding the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3654"></a><span class="t12">2. Nāssa sīlaṁ vijānātha, anaññāya pasaṁsatha,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3655"></a><a id="a3656"></a><a id="a3657"></a><a id="a3658"></a><a id="a3659"></a><a id="a3660"></a><span class="t12">Aggihuttañ-ca uhannaṁ, dve ca bhinnā kamaṇḍalū ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a3661"></a><a id="a3662"></a><a id="a3663"></a><span class="t4">You do not understand his character, unknowing, you praise him, he defecated on the fire offering, and broke the waterpots in two. </span><span class="t18">[2.51]</span></p>
<p class="p23">When the people heard what a rascally monkey it was, seizing sticks and clods they pelted him, and gave their alms to the monks. The sages returned to the Himālayas; and without once interrupting their Absorption they came at last to Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At the end of this discourse, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;This deceitful person was in those days the monkey; the Buddha&rsquo;s followers were the company of sages; and their leader was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present a king of Kosala wants to go on an expedition with his army, but first he sought the counsel of the Buddha, who tells a story of a monkey who lost one pea, and dropped all the other peas he had when seeking to find the lost one.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;A foolish monkey.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{2.74}</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a king of Kosala.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3672"></a><span class="t30">One rainy season, disaffection broke out on his borders. The troops stationed there, after two or three battles in which they failed to conquer their adversaries, sent a message to the king. In spite of the season, in spite of the rains, he took the field, and encamped before Jetavana. Then he began to ponder. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis a bad season for an expedition; every crevice and hollow is full of water; the road is heavy: I&rsquo;ll go visit the Teacher. He will be sure to ask &lsquo;whither away,&rsquo; then I&rsquo;ll tell him. It is not only in things of the future life that our Teacher protects me, but he protects in the things which we now see. So if my going is not to prosper, he will say &lsquo;It is a bad time to go, sire;&rsquo; but if I am to prosper, he will say nothing.&rdquo; So into Jetavana he came, and after greeting the Teacher sat down on one side.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Whence come you, O king,&rdquo; asked the Teacher, &ldquo;at this unseasonable hour?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am on my way to quell a border rising; and I come first to bid you farewell.&rdquo; To this the Teacher said: &ldquo;So it happened before, that mighty monarchs, before setting out for war, have listened to the word of the wise, and turned back from an unseasonable expedition.&rdquo; Then, at the king&rsquo;s request, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, he had a councillor who was his right-hand man and gave him advice in things spiritual and temporal. There was a rising on the frontier, and the <span class="t18">[2.52] </span>troops there stationed sent the king a letter. The king started, rainy season though it was, and formed a camp in his park. The Bodhisatta stood before the king. At that moment the people had steamed some peas for the horses, and poured them out into a trough. One of the monkeys that lived in the park jumped down from a tree, filled his mouth and hands with the peas, then up again, and sitting down in the tree he began to eat. As he ate, one pea fell from his hand upon the ground. Down dropped at once all the peas from his hands and mouth, <span class="t18">{2.75}</span> and down from the tree he came, to hunt for the lost pea. But that pea he could not find; so he climbed up his tree again, and sat still, very glum, looking like someone who had lost a thousand in some lawsuit.</p>
<p class="p7">The king observed what the monkey had done, and pointed it out to the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;Friend, what do you think of that?&rdquo; he asked. To which the Bodhisatta made answer, &ldquo;King, this is what fools of little wit are wont to do; they spend a pound to win a penny,&rdquo; and he went on to repeat the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3673"></a><a id="a3674"></a><span class="t12">1. Bālo vatāyaṁ dumasākhagocaro &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3675"></a><a id="a3676"></a><span class="t12">Paññā janinda na-y-imassa vijjati &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3677"></a><a id="a3678"></a><span class="t12">Kaḷāyamuṭṭhiṁ avakir</span><span class="t46">i</span><span class="t12">ya kevalaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ekaṁ kaḷāyaṁ patitaṁ gavesatī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a3679"></a><a id="a3680"></a><a id="a3681"></a><a id="a3682"></a><a id="a3683"></a><a id="a3684"></a><a id="a3685"></a><a id="a3686"></a><a id="a3687"></a><span class="t4">The fool, who resorts to the tree branches &ndash; leader of men, wisdom&rsquo;s not found in him &ndash; threw away a whole fistful of cow peas, seeking out one cow pea that had fallen.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Then the Bodhisatta approached the king, and addressing him again, repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3688"></a><span class="t12">2. Evam-eva mayaṁ, rāja, ye caññe atilobhino,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3689"></a><span class="t12">Appena bahuṁ jiyyāma, kaḷāyeneva vānaro ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a3690"></a><a id="a3691"></a><a id="a3692"></a><span class="t4">Such are we, O king, those who live amongst others, having great greed, we lose a lot through a little, like the monkey with the cow pea. </span><span class="t18">{2.76}</span></p>
<p class="p23">On hearing this address the king turned and went straight back to Benares. And the outlaws hearing that the king had set forth from his capital to make mincemeat of his enemies, hurried away from the borders.</p>
<p class="p7">At the time when this story was told, the outlaws ran away in just the same fashion. The king, after listening to the Teacher&rsquo;s utterances, rose and took his leave, and went back to Sāvatthi.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, after this discourse was at an end, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;In those days Ānanda was the king, and I myself was the wise councillor.&rdquo;</span></p>
