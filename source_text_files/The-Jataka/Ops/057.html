<p class="p7"><a id="a8622"></a><span class="t15">In the present one monk comes in from the country and goes too early and too late on alms round, and then blames the families for not giving to him. The Buddha tells a story of old in which an ascetic failed to receive alms, but was not perturbed by it, and later taught Dhamma to the householder.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the ascetic (tāpasa),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Ānanda = the wealthy man of Benares (Bārāṇasiseṭṭhi).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Alas, we offered you.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while living at Jetavana, about a certain monk. He came, it was said, from the country to Jetavana, and, after putting away his bowl and robe, he saluted the Teacher and inquired of the young novices, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, who look after the visiting monks that come to Sāvatthi?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.119}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;The Treasurer Anāthapiṇḍika,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and the great and holy lay sister Visākhā look after the order of the monks, and stand in the place of father and mother to them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.79] </span><span class="t30">he said, and next day quite early, before a single monk had entered the house, he came to Anāthapiṇḍika&rsquo;s door. From his having come at an unseasonable hour there was no one to attend to him. Without getting anything there he went off to the door of Visākhā&rsquo;s house. There also from having come too early, he got nothing. After wandering here and there he came back, and finding the rice-gruel was all finished, he went off. Again he wandered about here and there, and on his return, finding the rice all finished, he went back to the monastery, and said: &ldquo;The monks here speak of these two families as faithful believers, but both of them really are without faith and unbelievers.&rdquo; Thus did he go about abusing these families.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So one day they started a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, how that a certain monk from the country came to the door of certain households too early, and failing to obtain alms went about reviling those families. When the Teacher came and inquired what was the topic the monks were sitting to discuss, on hearing what it was, he called the monk and asked him if it were true. When the monk said: &ldquo;Yes, your reverence, it is true,&rdquo; the Teacher asked, &ldquo;Why are you angry, monk? Of old, before Buddha arose upon the world, even ascetics when they visited a household and received no alms, showed no anger.&rdquo; And with this he told a story of the olden days.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family, and when he was of age he studied all the arts at Taxila, and subsequently adopted the ascetic life. After sojourning a long time in the Himālayas he went to Benares to procure salt and vinegar, and, taking up his abode in a garden, on the next day he entered the city for alms. There was at this time a merchant at Benares, who was a faithful believer. The Bodhisatta asked which was a believing household, and on hearing of the merchant&rsquo;s family, he went to the door of his house. At that moment the merchant had gone to pay his respects to the king, and neither did any of his people happen to see him. So he turned back and came away.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the merchant who was returning from the palace saw him, <span class="t18">{3.120}</span> and saluting him took his alms-bowl and led him to his house. There he offered him a seat and comforted him with the washing and anointing of his feet, and with rice, cakes and other food, and in the course of his meal he asked him one thing and another, and after he had finished eating, he saluted him and sitting respectfully on one side, he said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, strangers who have come to our doors, whether beggars or holy monks or brahmins, have never before gone away without receiving marks of honour and respect, but today owing to your not being seen by our retainers, you have gone away without being offered a seat, or water to drink, and without having your feet washed, or rice and gruel given you to eat. This is our fault. You must forgive us in this.&rdquo; And with these words he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Alas, we offered you no seat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No water brought, nor anything to eat:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We here confess our sinfulness,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And pardon humbly, venerable sir, entreat.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.80]</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta on hearing this repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Nought have I to condone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No anger do I feel,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The thought just once I own</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Across my mind did steal,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Habits of people here</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Are just a trifle queer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The merchant hearing this responded in two more verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8624"></a><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;The custom of our family &ndash; &rsquo;twas so</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Received by us from ages long ago &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Is to provide the stranger with a seat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Supply his needs, bring water for his feet</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And every guest as kinsman dear to treat.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.121}</span></p>
<p class="p6">And the Bodhisatta, after sojourning there a few days, and teaching the merchant of Benares his duty, went straight back to the Himālayas, where he developed the Super Knowledges and Attainments.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, revealed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the monk attained fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the merchant of Benares, and I myself was the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the king of Kosala&rsquo;s queen has a longing to drink the king&rsquo;s blood while pregnant. Despite the queen trying to miscarry the child, the king preserved the life of the child who would eventually kill him. The Buddha tells the king a story about a previous life in which the son was prevented from harming his father, and only was released from captivity once the king had died a natural death.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;With sense so nice.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8635"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while living in the Bamboo Grove, of prince Ajātasattu. At the time of his conception there arose in his mother, the daughter of the king of Kosala, a chronic longing to drink blood from the right knee of (her husband) king Bimbisāra.</span><a id="a8636"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15500"><span class="t9">{602}</span></a><span class="t30"> Being questioned by her attendant ladies, she told them how it was with her. The king too hearing of it called his astrologers and said: &ldquo;The queen is possessed of such and such a longing. What will be the issue of it?&rdquo; The astrologers said: &ldquo;The child conceived in the womb of the queen will kill you and seize your kingdom.&rdquo; &ldquo;If my son,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;should kill me and seize my kingdom, what is the harm of it?&rdquo; And then he had his right knee opened with a sword and letting the blood fall into a golden dish gave it to the queen to drink. She thought: &ldquo;If the son that is born of me should kill his father, what care I for him?&rdquo; and endeavoured to bring about a miscarriage. </span><span class="t18">{3.122}</span><span class="t30"> The king hearing of it called her to him and said: &ldquo;My dear, it is said, my son will slay me and seize my kingdom.</span><span class="t18"> [3.81] </span><span class="t30">But I am not exempt from old age and death: suffer me to behold the face of my child. Henceforth act not after this manner.&rdquo; But she still went to the garden and acted as before. The king on hearing of it forbade her visits to the garden, and when she had gone her full time she gave birth to a son. On his naming-day, because he had been his father&rsquo;s enemy, while still unborn, they called him prince Ajātasattu [Unborn Enemy].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">As he grew up with his princely surroundings, one day the Teacher accompanied by five hundred monks came to the king&rsquo;s palace and sat down. The assembly of the monks with Buddha at their head was entertained by the king with choice food, both hard and soft. And after saluting the Teacher the king sat down to listen to the Dhamma. At this moment they dressed up the young prince and brought him to the king. The king welcomed the child with a strong show of affection and placed him on his lap, and fondling the boy with the natural love of a father for his child, he did not listen to the Dhamma. The Teacher observing his inattention said: &ldquo;Great king, formerly kings when suspicious of their sons had them kept in a secret place, and gave orders that at their death they were to be brought forth and set upon the throne.&rdquo; And at the request of the king he told him a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a far-famed teacher at Taxila and trained many young princes and sons of brahmins in the arts. Now the son of the king of Benares, when he was sixteen years old, came to him and after he had acquired the three Vedas and all the liberal arts and was perfect in them, he took leave of his master. The teacher regarding him with his gift of seeing the future thought: &ldquo;There is danger coming to this man through his son. By my magic power I will deliver him from it.&rdquo; And composing four verses he gave them to the young prince and spoke as follows, &ldquo;My son, after you are seated on the throne, when your son is sixteen years old, utter the first verse while eating your rice; repeat the second verse at the time of the great reception; the third, as you are ascending to the palace roof, standing at the head of the stairs, and the fourth, <span class="t18">{3.123}</span> when entering the royal chamber, as you stand on the threshold.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The prince readily assented to this and saluting his teacher went away. And after acting as viceroy, on his father&rsquo;s death he ascended the throne. His son, when he was sixteen years of age, on the king&rsquo;s going forth to take his pleasure in the garden, observing his father&rsquo;s majesty and power was filled with a desire to kill him and seize upon his kingdom, and spoke to his attendants about it. They said: &ldquo;True, sir, what is the good of obtaining power, when one is old? You must by some means or other kill the king and possess yourself of his kingdom.&rdquo; The prince said: &ldquo;I will kill him by putting poison in his food.&rdquo; So he took some poison and sat down to eat his evening meal with his father. The king, when the rice was just served in the bowl, spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8637"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;With sense so nice, the husks from rice</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Rats keen are to discriminate:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They cared not much the husks to touch,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But grain by grain the rice they ate.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.82]</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;I am discovered,&rdquo; thought the prince, and not daring to administer the poison in the bowl of rice, he rose up and bowing to the king went away. He told the story to his attendants and said: &ldquo;Today I am found out. How now shall I kill him?&rdquo; From this day forth they lay concealed in the garden, and consulting together in whispers said: &ldquo;There is still one expedient. When it is time to attend the great reception, gird on your sword, and taking your stand amongst the councillors, when you see the king off his guard, you must strike him a blow with your sword and kill him.&rdquo; Thus they arranged it. The prince readily agreed, and at the time of the great reception, he girt on his sword <span class="t18">{3.124}</span> and moving about from place to place looked out for an opportunity to strike the king. At this moment the king uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;The secret counsel taken in the wood</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By me is understood:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The village plot soft whispered in the ear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That too I hear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thought the prince, &ldquo;My father knows that I am his enemy,&rdquo; and ran away and told his attendants. After the lapse of seven or eight days they said: &ldquo;Prince, your father is ignorant of your feeling towards him. You only fancy this in your own mind. Put him to death.&rdquo; So one day he took his sword and stood at the top of the stairs in the royal closet. The king standing at the head of the staircase spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;A monkey once did cruel measures take</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His tender offspring impotent to make.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thought the prince, &ldquo;My father wants to seize me,&rdquo; and in his terror he fled away and told his attendants he had been threatened by his father. After the lapse of a fortnight they said: &ldquo;Prince, if the king knew this, he would not have put up with it so long a time. Your imagination suggests this to you. <span class="t18">{3.125}</span> Put him to death.&rdquo; So one day he took his sword and entering the royal chamber on the upper floor of the palace he lay down beneath the couch, intending to slay the king, as soon as he came. At the close of the evening meal, the king sent his retinue away, wishing to lie down, and entering the royal chamber, as he stood on the threshold, he uttered the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Your cautious creeping ways</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like one-eyed goat in mustard field that strays,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And who you are that lurkest here below,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This too I know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thought the prince, &ldquo;My father has found me out. Now he will put me to death.&rdquo; And seized with fear he came out from beneath the couch, and throwing down his sword at the king&rsquo;s feet and saying: &ldquo;Pardon me, my lord,&rdquo; he lay grovelling before him. The king said: &ldquo;You thought, no <span class="t18">[3.83] </span>one knows what I am about.&rdquo; And after rebuking him he ordered him to be bound in chains and put into the prison house, and set a guard over him. Then the king meditated on the virtues of the Bodhisatta. And by and by he died. When they had celebrated his funeral rites, they took the young prince out of prison and set him on the throne.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher here ended his lesson and said: &ldquo;Thus, sire, kings of old suspected in cases in which suspicion was justified,&rdquo; and related this incident, </span><span class="t18">{3.126}</span><span class="t30"> but the king gave no heed to his words. The Teacher thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the far-famed teacher at Taxila was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the outside sects are losing their gains after the Buddha had arisen and started teaching. The Buddha tells a story of a crow who was greatly honoured when he was the only bird in the country, but once a peacock came he lost his gains and respect.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the king of the peacocks (morarājā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Nigaṇṭha Nāthaputta = the crow (kāka).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a8643"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Gain, Fame, Animals, Birds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Before the crested peacock.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher when at Jetavana, of certain heretics who lost their former gains and glory. For the heretics who before the birth of Buddha received gain and honour, lost the same at his birth, becoming like fireflies at sunrise. Their fate was discussed in the Dhamma Hall. When the Teacher came and inquired what was the topic the monks were discussing in their assembly, on being told what it was, he said: &ldquo;Monks, not only now, but formerly too, before the appearance of those endowed with virtue, such as were without virtue attained to the highest gain and glory, but when those who were endowed with virtue appeared, such as were devoid of it lost their gain and glory.&rdquo; And with this he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a young peacock. And when he was fully grown, he was exceedingly beautiful and lived in a forest. At that time some merchants came to the kingdom of Bāveru, bringing on board ship with them a foreign crow. At this time, it is said, there were no birds in Bāveru. The natives who from time to time came and saw this bird perched on the top of the mast, said: &ldquo;Mark the colour of this bird&rsquo;s skin. Look at its beaked mouth at the end of its throat, and its eyes like jewels.&rdquo; Thus singing the praises of this crow they said to these merchants, &ldquo;Sirs, give us this bird. We have need of it, and you can get another in your own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Then take it,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;at a price.&rdquo; <span class="t18">[3.84] </span>&ldquo;Give it us for a single piece of money,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;We will not sell it for that,&rdquo; said the merchants. <span class="t18">{3.127}</span></p>
<p class="p7">Gradually increasing their offer the people said: &ldquo;Give it us for a hundred pieces of money.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is very useful,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;to us, but let there be friendship between us and you.&rdquo; And they sold it for one hundred pieces.</p>
<p class="p7">The natives took it and put it in a golden cage and fed it with various kinds of fish and meat and wild fruits. In a place where no other birds existed, a crow endowed with ten evil qualities attained the highest gain and glory. The next time these merchants came to the kingdom of Bāveru, they brought a royal peacock which they had trained to scream at the snapping of the fingers and to dance at the clapping of the hands. When a crowd had gathered together, the bird stood in the fore part of the vessel, and flapping its wings uttered a sweet sound and danced.</p>
<p class="p7">The people that saw it were highly delighted and said: &ldquo;This king of birds is very beautiful and well-trained. Give it to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The merchants said: &ldquo;We first brought a crow. You took that. Now we have brought this royal peacock and you beg for this too. It will be impossible to come and even mention the name of any bird in your country.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be content, sirs,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;give this bird to us and get another in your own land.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And raising the price offered they at last bought it for a thousand pieces. Then they put it in a cage ornamented with the seven jewels and fed it on fish, flesh and wild fruits, as well as with honey, fried corn, sugar-water and the like. Thus did the royal peacock receive the highest gain and glory. From the day of his coming, the gain and honour paid to the crow fell off. And no one wanted even to look at it. The crow no longer getting food either hard or soft, with a cry of &ldquo;Caw, caw,&rdquo; went and settled on a dunghill.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, making the connection between the two stories, after Fully Awakening repeated these verses: </span><span class="t18">{3.128}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Before the crested peacock had appeared,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Crows were with gifts of fruit and meat revered:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. The sweet-voiced peacock to Bāveru came,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The crow at once was stripped of gifts and fame.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. So man to divers monks due honour paid,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Till Buddha the full light of Truth displayed:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. But when the sweet-voiced Buddha preached the law,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From heretics their gifts and praise all men withdraw.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">After uttering these four verses, he thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the Jain Nāthaputta was the crow, and I myself was the royal peacock.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a8650"></a><span class="t15">In the present Anāthapiṇḍika gives so much in alms he threatens to impoverish himself and his family. A Devatā who lives in the household seeks to prevent him from giving any more. The Buddha tells a story of a wealthy man in the past who was very generous. To test him Sakka hid away all his possessions. Still he insisted on riasing money for gifts with his hands and giving.</span></p>

The incident that gave rise to the story has already been told in full in the Khadiraṅgārajātaka [Ja 40].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8656"></a><span class="t34">For Anāthapiṇḍika, who had lavished fifty-four crores on the dispensation of the Buddha over the monastery alone, and who valued naught else save only the Three Jewels, used to go every day while the Teacher was at Jetavana to attend the Great Services &ndash; once at daybreak, once after breakfast, and once in the evening. There were intermediate services too; but he never went empty-handed, for fear the novices and lads should look to see what he had brought with him. When he went in the early morning, he used to have rice-gruel taken up; after breakfast, ghee, butter, honey, molasses, and the like; and in the evening, he brought perfumes, garlands and cloths. So much did he expend day after day, that his expense knew no bounds. Moreover, many traders borrowed money from him on their bonds &ndash; to the amount of eighteen crores; and the great merchant never called the money in. Furthermore, another eighteen crores of the family property, which were buried in the riverbank, were washed out to sea, when the bank was swept away by a storm; and down rolled the brazen pots, with fastenings and seals unbroken, to the bottom of the ocean. In his house, too, there was always rice standing ready for 500 monks &ndash; so that the merchant&rsquo;s house was to the Saṅgha like a pool dug where four roads meet, yes, like mother and father was he to them. Therefore, even the Supreme Buddha used to go to his house, and the Eighty Chief Elders too; and the number of other monks passing in and out was beyond measure.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now his house was seven stories high and had seven portals; and over the fourth gateway dwelt a Devatā who was a heretic. When the Supreme Buddha came into the house, she could not stay in her abode on high, but came down with her children to the ground-floor; and she had to do the same whenever the Eighty Chief Elders or the other elders came in and out. Thought she, &ldquo;So long as the ascetic Gotama and his disciples keep coming into this house I can have no peace here; I can&rsquo;t be eternally coming downstairs to the ground floor. I must contrive to stop them from coming any more to this house.&rdquo; So one day, when the business manager had retired to rest, she appeared before him in visible shape.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8657"></a><span class="t34">&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;the Devatā who lives over the fourth gateway.&rdquo; &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see what the merchant is doing. Heedless of his own future, he is drawing upon his resources, only to enrich the ascetic Gotama. He engages in no commerce; he undertakes no business. Advise the merchant to attend to his business, and arrange that the ascetic Gotama with his disciples shall come no more into the house.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then said he, &ldquo;Foolish Devatā, if the merchant does spend his money, he spends it on the dispensation of the Buddha, which leads to safety. Even if he were to seize me by the hair and sell me for a slave, I will say nothing. Begone!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Another day, she went to the merchant&rsquo;s eldest son and gave him the same advice. And he flouted her in just the same manner. But to the merchant himself she did not so much as dare to speak on the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8658"></a><span class="t34">Now by dint of unending munificence and of doing no business, the merchant&rsquo;s incomings diminished and his estate grew less and less; so that he sank by degrees into poverty, and his table, his dress, and his bed and food were no longer what they had once been. Yet, in spite of his altered circumstances, be continued to entertain the Saṅgha, though he was no longer able to feast them. So one day when he had made his bow and taken his seat, the Teacher said to him, &ldquo;Householder, are gifts being given at your house?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s only a little sour husk-porridge, left over from yesterday.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be not distressed, householder, at the thought that you can only offer what is unpalatable. If the heart be good, the food given to Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, and their disciples, cannot but be good too. And why? Because of the greatness of the fruit thereof. For he who can make his heart acceptable cannot give an unacceptable gift &ndash; as is to be testified by the following passage:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">&ldquo;For, if the heart have faith, no gift is small</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">To Buddhas or to their disciples true.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">&rsquo;Tis said no service can be reckoned small</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">That&rsquo;s paid to Buddhas, lords of great renown.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">Mark well what fruit rewarded that poor gift</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">Of pottage &ndash; dried-up, sour, and lacking salt.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t34">Also, he said this further thing, &ldquo;Householder, in giving this unpalatable gift, you are giving it to those who have entered on the Noble Eightfold Path. Whereas I, when in Velāma&rsquo;s time I stirred up all Jambudīpa by giving the seven things of price, and in my largesse poured them forth as though I had made into one mighty stream the five great rivers &ndash; I yet found none who had reached the Three Refuges or kept the Five Precepts; for rare are those who are worthy of offerings. Therefore, let not your heart be troubled by the thought that your gift is unpalatable.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated the Velāmakasutta [AN 9.20].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now that Devatā who had not dared to speak to the merchant in the days of his magnificence, thought that now he was poor he would hearken to her, and so, entering his chamber at dead of night she appeared before him in visible shape, standing in mid-air. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the merchant, when he became aware of her presence. &ldquo;I am the Devatā, great merchant, who dwells over the fourth gateway.&rdquo; &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;To give you counsel.&rdquo; &ldquo;Proceed, then.&rdquo; &ldquo;Great merchant, you take no thought for your own future or for your own children. You have expended vast sums on the dispensation of the ascetic Gotama; in fact, by long-continued expenditure and by not undertaking new business you have been brought by the ascetic Gotama to poverty. But even in your poverty you do not shake off the ascetic Gotama! The ascetics are in and out of your house this very day just the same! What they have had of you cannot be recovered. That may be taken for certain. But henceforth don&rsquo;t you go yourself to the ascetic Gotama and don&rsquo;t let his disciples set foot inside your house. Do not even turn to look at the ascetic Gotama but attend to your trade and traffic in order to restore the family estate.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8659"></a><span class="t34">Then he said to her, &ldquo;Was this the counsel you wanted to give me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it was.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Said the merchant, &ldquo;The One with Ten Powers has made me proof against a hundred, a thousand, yes against a hundred thousand Devatās such as you are! My faith is strong and steadfast as Mount Sineru! My substance has been expended on the dispensation that leads to safety. Wicked are your words; it is a blow aimed at the dispensation of the Buddhas by you, you wicked and impudent wretch. I cannot live under the same roof with you; be off at once from my house and seek shelter elsewhere!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Hearing these words of that converted man and elect disciple, she could not stay, but repairing to her dwelling, took her children by the hand and went forth. But though she went, she was minded, if she could not find herself a lodging elsewhere, to appease the merchant and return to dwell in his house; and in this mind she went to the tutelary deity of the city and with due salutation stood before him. Being asked what had brought her there, she said: &ldquo;My lord, I have been speaking imprudently to Anāthapiṇḍika, and he in his anger has turned me out of my home. Take me to him and make it up between us, so that he may let me live there again.&rdquo; &ldquo;But what was it you said to the merchant?&rdquo; &ldquo;I told him for the future not to support the Buddha and the Saṅgha, and not to let the ascetic Gotama set foot again in his house. This is what I said, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wicked were your words; it was a blow aimed at the dispensation. I cannot take you with me to the merchant.&rdquo; Meeting with no support from him, she went to the Four Great Kings of the world. And being repulsed by them in the same manner, she went on to Sakka, King of Devas, and told him her story, beseeching him still more earnestly, as follows, &ldquo;Deva, finding no shelter, I wander about homeless, leading my children by the hand. Grant me of your majesty some place wherein to dwell.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">And he too said to her, &ldquo;You have done wickedly; it was a blow aimed at the Conqueror&rsquo;s dispensation. I cannot speak to the merchant on your behalf. But I can tell you one way whereby the merchant may be led to pardon you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pray tell me, Deva.&rdquo; &ldquo;Men have had eighteen crores of the merchant on bonds. Take the semblance of his agent, and without telling anybody repair to their houses with the bonds, in the company of some young Yakkhas. Stand in the middle of their houses with the bond in one hand and a receipt in the other, and terrify them with your Yakkha power, saying, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your acknowledgment of the debt. Our merchant did not move in the matter while he was affluent; but now he is poor, and you must pay up the money you owe.&rsquo; By your Yakkha power obtain all those eighteen crores of gold and fill the merchant&rsquo;s empty treasuries. He had another treasure buried in the banks of the river Aciravatī, but when the bank was washed away, the treasure was swept into the sea. Get that back also by your supernatural power and store it in his treasuries. Further, there is another sum of eighteen crores lying unowned in such and such a place. Bring that too and pour the money into his empty treasuries. When you have atoned by the recovery of these fifty-four crores, ask the merchant to forgive you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good, Deva,&rdquo; said she. And she set to work obediently, and did just as she had been bidden. When she had recovered all the money, she went into the merchant&rsquo;s chamber at dead of night and appeared before him in visible shape standing in the air.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The merchant asking who was there, she replied, &ldquo;It is I, great merchant, the blind and foolish Devatā who lived over your fourth gateway. In the greatness of my infatuate folly I knew not the virtues of a Buddha, and so came to say what I said to you some days ago. Pardon me my fault! At the instance of Sakka, King of Devas, I have made atonement by recovering the eighteen crores owing to you, the eighteen crores which had been washed down into the sea, and another eighteen crores which were lying unowned in such and such a place &ndash; making fifty-four crores in all, which I have poured into your empty treasure-chambers. The sum you expended on the monastery at Jetavana is now made up again. While I have nowhere to dwell, I am in misery. Bear not in mind what I did in my ignorant folly, great merchant, but pardon me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Anāthapiṇḍika, hearing what she said, thought to himself, &ldquo;She is a Devatā, and she says she has atoned, and confesses her fault. The Teacher shall consider this and make his virtues known to her. I will take her before the Supreme Buddha.&rdquo; So he said: &ldquo;My good Devatā, if you want me to pardon you, ask me in the presence of the master.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will. Take me along with you to the Teacher.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he. And early in the morning, when night was just passing away, he took her with him to the Teacher, and told the Tathāgata all that she had done.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Hearing this, the Teacher said: &ldquo;You see, householder, how the defiled man regards defilement as excellent before it ripens to its fruit. But when it has ripened, then he sees defilements to be defiled. Likewise the good man looks on his goodness as wrong before it ripens to its fruit; but when it ripens, he sees it to be goodness.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated these two verses from the Dhammapada [119-120]:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><a id="a8660"></a><span class="t37">&ldquo;The defiled man thinks his deed is good,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">So long as wrong has ripened not to fruit.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">But when his wrong at last to ripeness grows,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">The defiled man sees &lsquo;It was wrong I wrought.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">The good man thinks his goodness is but wrong,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">So long as it has ripened not to fruit.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">But when his goodness unto ripeness grows,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">The good man sees that &lsquo;It was good I wrought.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t34">At the close of these verses that Devatā was established in the Fruit of the First Path. She fell at the wheel-marked feet of the Teacher, crying, &ldquo;Stained as I was with passion, depraved by defilements, misled by delusion, and blinded by ignorance, I spoke wickedly because I knew not your virtues. Pardon me!&rdquo; Then she received pardon from the Teacher and from the great merchant.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At this time Anāthapiṇḍika sang his own praises in the Teacher&rsquo;s presence, saying: &ldquo;Sir, though this Devatā did her best to stop me from giving support to the Buddha and his following, she could not succeed; and though she tried to stop me from giving gifts, yet I gave them still! Was not this goodness on my part?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8661"></a><a id="a8662"></a><a id="a8663"></a><span class="t30">On this occasion the Teacher addressing Anāthapiṇḍika said: &ldquo;Wise men of old, my lay brother, gave alms, rejecting the counsel of Sakka, king of heaven, when he stood in mid-air and tried to prevent them, saying, &lsquo;Give not alms.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span><a id="a8664"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15502"><span class="t9">{603}</span></a><span class="t30"> And at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta became a great merchant, named Visayha, worth eighty crores. <span class="t18">{3.129}</span> And being endowed with the five precepts, he was liberal and fond of generosity. He had alms halls built at the four city gates, in the heart of the city, and at the door of his own house. At these six points he started almsgiving, and every day six hundred thousand men went forth to beg, and the food of the Bodhisatta and that of the beggars was exactly the same.</p>
<p class="p7">And as he thus stirred up the people of all Jambudīpa by his gifts, the abode of Sakka was shaken by the extraordinary efficacy of his generosity, and the yellow marble throne of the king of heaven showed signs of heat. Sakka exclaimed, &ldquo;Who, I wonder, would make me fall from my seat in heaven?&rdquo; And looking about him he espied the great merchant and thought to himself, &ldquo;This Visayha gives alms and by scattering his gifts everywhere is stirring up all Jambudīpa. By means of his generosity, I think, he will dethrone me and himself become Sakka. I will destroy his wealth and make him a poor man, and so bring it about that he shall no longer give alms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So Sakka caused his oil, honey, molasses, and the like, even all his treasure of grain to vanish, as well as his slaves and work people. Those who were deprived of his gifts came and said: &ldquo;My lord, the alms-hall has disappeared. We do not find anything in the various places set up by you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take money hence,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do not cut off the giving of alms.&rdquo; And calling his wife, he bade her keep up her generosity. She searched the whole house, and not finding a single piece of money, she said: &ldquo;My lord, except the clothes we wear, I see nothing. The whole house is empty.&rdquo; Opening the seven jewel treasuries they found nothing, and save the merchant and his wife no one else was seen, neither slaves <span class="t18">[3.86] </span>nor hirelings. The Bodhisatta again addressing his wife said: &ldquo;My dear, we cannot possibly cut off our charities. Search the whole house till you find something.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">At that moment a certain grasscutter threw down his sickle and pole and the rope for binding the grass in the doorway, and ran away. The merchant&rsquo;s wife found them and said: &ldquo;My lord, this is all I see,&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.130}</span> and brought and gave them to him. Said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;My dear, all these years I have never mown grass before, but today I will mow grass and take and sell it, and by this means dispense the fitting alms.&rdquo; So through fear of having to cut off his charities, he took the sickle and the pole and the rope, and going forth from the city came to a place of much grass, and cutting it tied it up in two bundles, saying: &ldquo;One shall belong to us, and with the other I will give alms.&rdquo; And hanging the grass on the pole he took it and went and sold it at the city gate, and receiving two small coins he gave half the money to the beggars.</p>
<p class="p7">Now there were many beggars, and as they repeatedly cried out, &ldquo;Give to us also,&rdquo; he gave the other half of the money also, and passed the day with his wife fasting. In this way six days passed, and on the seventh day, while he was gathering the grass, as he was naturally delicate and had been fasting for seven days, no sooner did the heat of the sun strike upon his forehead, than his eyes began to swim in his head, and he became unconscious and fell down, scattering the grass. Sakka was moving about, observing what Visayha did. And at that instant the god came, and standing in the air uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Of old, Visayha, you did alms bestow</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And to almsgiving loss of wealth do owe.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Henceforth show self-restraint, refuse to give,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And you midst lasting joys for aye shall live.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.131}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta on hearing his words asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am Sakka,&rdquo; he said. The Bodhisatta replied, &ldquo;Sakka himself by giving alms and taking upon him the moral duties, and keeping fast days and fulfilling the seven vows attained the office of Sakka. But now you forbid the generosity that brought about your own greatness. Truly you are guilty of an unworthy deed.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;It is not right, men say, that deed of shame</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should stain the honour of a noble name.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O you that do a thousand eyes possess</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Guard us from this, e&rsquo;en in our sore distress.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Let not our wealth in faithless wise be spent</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On our own pleasure or aggrandisement,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But as of old our stores with increase bless.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. By that same road a former chariot went</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A second may well go. So will we give</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As long as we have wherewithal to live,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor at the worst each generous thought repress.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.87] {3.132}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka being unable to stop him from his purpose asked him why he gave alms. &ldquo;Desiring,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;neither to become Sakka nor Brahmā, but seeking omniscience do I give.&rdquo; Sakka in token of his delight on hearing these words patted him on the back with his hands. At the very instant the Bodhisatta enjoyed this favour, his whole frame was filled with joy. By the supernatural power of Sakka all manner of prosperity was restored to him. &ldquo;Great merchant,&rdquo; said Sakka, &ldquo;henceforth do you every day give alms, distributing twelve hundred thousand portions.&rdquo; And creating countless wealth in his house, Sakka took leave of him and returned straight to his own place of abode.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the mother of Rāhula was the merchant&rsquo;s wife, and I myself was Visayha.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past at Benares was a king named Kaṇḍari who was a very handsome man, and to him daily his counsellors would bring a thousand boxes of perfume, and with this perfume they would make the house trim and neat, and then splitting up the boxes they would make scented firewood and cook the food therewith. Now his wife was a lovely woman named Kinnarā, and his family priest Pañcālacaṇḍa was the same age as himself and full of wisdom. And in the wall near the king&rsquo;s palace grew a Jambu plum tree and its branches hung down upon the wall, and in the shade of it dwelt a loathsome, misshapen handicapped man.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now one day queen Kinnarā looking out of her window saw him and conceived a passion for him. And at night after winning the king&rsquo;s favour by her charms, as soon as he had fallen asleep, she would get up softly and putting all manner of dainty food in a golden vessel and taking it on her hips, she would let herself down through the window by means of a rope of cloth, and climbing up the Jambu plum tree drop down by a branch of it and give her dainty food to the handicapped man and take her pleasure with him, and then ascend to the palace the same way that she had come down, and after shampooing herself all over with perfumes lie down by the king&rsquo;s side. In this way she would constantly misconduct herself with this handicapped man and the king knew nothing of it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8679"></a><span class="t11">One day the king after a solemn procession round the city was entering his palace when he saw this handicapped man, a pitiable object, lying in the shade of the Jambu plum, and he said to his family priest, &ldquo;Just look at this ghost of a man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it possible, my friend, that any woman moved by lust would come nigh such a loathsome creature?&rdquo; Hearing what he said the handicapped man, swelling with pride, thought: &ldquo;What is it this king said? I think he knows nothing of his queen&rsquo;s coming to visit me.&rdquo; And stretching out his folded hands towards the Jambu plum tree he cried, &ldquo;O my lord, you guardian spirit of this tree, excepting you no one knows about this.&rdquo; The family priest noticing his action thought: &ldquo;Of a truth the king&rsquo;s chief consort by the help of this tree comes and misconducts herself with him.&rdquo; So he said to the king, &ldquo;Sire, at night what is it like when you come into contact with the queen&rsquo;s person?&rdquo; &ldquo;I notice nothing else,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but that at the middle watch her body is cold.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, sire, whatever may be the case with other women, your queen Kinnarā misconducts herself with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is this you say, my friend? Would such a charming lady take her pleasure with this disgusting creature?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then, sire, put it to the proof.&rdquo; &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said the king, and after supper he lay down with her, to put it to the test.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8680"></a><span class="t11">At the usual time for falling asleep, he pretended to drop off, and she acted as before. The king following in her steps took his stand in the shade of the Jambu plum tree. The handicapped man was in a rage with the queen and said: &ldquo;You are very late in coming,&rdquo; and struck with his hand the chain in her ear. So she said: &ldquo;Be not angry, my lord; I was watching for the king to fall asleep,&rdquo; and so saying she acted as it were a wife&rsquo;s part in his house. But when he struck her, the ear-ornament, which was like a lion&rsquo;s head, falling from her ear dropped at the king&rsquo;s feet. The king thought: &ldquo;Just this will be the best thing for me,&rdquo; and he took it away with him. And after misconducting herself with her lover she returned just as before and proceeded to lie down by the side of the king.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The king rejected her advances and next day he gave an order, saying: &ldquo;Let queen Kinnarā come, wearing every ornament I have given her.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;My lion&rsquo;s head jewel is with the goldsmith,&rdquo; and refused to come. When a second message was sent, she came with only a single ear-ornament. The king asked, &ldquo;Where is your earring?&rdquo; &ldquo;With the goldsmith.&rdquo; He sent for the goldsmith and said: &ldquo;Why do you not let the lady have her earring?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have it not, sire.&rdquo; The king was enraged and said: &ldquo;You wicked, vile woman, your goldsmith must be a man just like me,&rdquo; and so saying he threw the earring down before her and said to the family priest, &ldquo;Friend, you spoke the truth; go and have her head chopped off.&rdquo; So he secured her in a certain quarter of the palace and came and said to the king, &ldquo;Sire, be not angry with the queen Kinnarā: all women are just the same. If you are anxious to see how immoral women are, I will show you their wickedness and deceitfulness. Come, let us disguise ourselves and go into the country.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8681"></a><span class="t11">The king readily agreed and, handing over his kingdom to his mother, he set out on his travels with his family priest. When they had gone a league&rsquo;s journey and were seated by the high road, a certain gentleman of property, who was holding a marriage festival for his son, had seated the bride in a close carriage and was accompanying her with a large escort. On seeing this the family priest said: &ldquo;If you like, you can make this girl misconduct herself with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;What say you, my friend? With this great escort the thing is impossible.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then see this, my lord?&rdquo; And going forward he set up a tent-shaped screen not far from the high road and, placing the king inside the screen, himself sat down by the side of the road, weeping.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Then the gentleman on seeing it asked, &ldquo;Why, friend, are you weeping?&rdquo; &ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was heavy with child and I set out on a journey to take her to her own home, and while still on the way her pangs overtook her and she is in trouble within the screen, and she has no woman with her and I cannot go to her there. I do not know what will happen.&rdquo; &ldquo;She ought to have a woman with her: do not weep, there are numbers of women here; one of them shall go to her.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then let this maiden come; it will be a happy omen for the girl.&rdquo; He thought: &ldquo;What he says is true: it will be an auspicious thing for my daughter-in-law. She will be blessed with numerous sons and daughters,&rdquo; and he brought her there.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8682"></a><span class="t11">Passing inside the screen she fell in love at first sight with the king and committed adultery with him, and the king gave her his signet ring. So when the deed was done and she came out of the tent they asked her, &ldquo;What has she given birth to?&rdquo; &ldquo;A boy the colour of gold?&rdquo; So the gentleman took her and went off. The family priest came to the king and said: &ldquo;You have seen, sire, even a young girl is thus wicked. How much more will other women be so? Pray, sir, did you give her anything?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I gave her my signet ring.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will not allow her to keep it.&rdquo; And he followed in haste and caught up the carriage, and when they said: &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;This girl has gone off with a ring my brahmin wife had laid on her pillow: give up the ring, lady.&rdquo; In giving it she scratched the brahmin&rsquo;s hand, saying: &ldquo;Take it, you rogue.&rdquo; Thus did the brahmin in a variety of ways show the king that many other women are guilty of misconduct, and said: &ldquo;Let this suffice here; we will now go elsewhere, sire.&rdquo; The king traversed all Jambudīpa, and they said: &ldquo;All women will be just the same. What are they to us? Let us turn back.&rdquo; So they went straight home to Benares. The family priest said: &ldquo;It is thus, sire, with all women; so wicked is their nature. Forgive queen Kinnarā.&rdquo; At the prayer of his family priest he pardoned her, but had her thrust out from the palace. And when he had ejected her from the place, he chose another queen-consort, and he had the handicapped man driven forth and ordered the Jambu plum branch to be lopped off. At that time Kuṇāla was Pañcālacaṇḍa. So in telling the story of what he had seen with his own eyes, in illustration he spoke this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">1-2. &ldquo;This much from tale of Kaṇḍari and Kinnarā is shown;</span></p>

The incident that led to the story has already been given in detail.</span><a id="a8690"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15506"><span class="t9">{604}</span></a><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.88]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8691"></a><span class="t34">For once when the monks were gathered together in the Dhamma Hall, they sat talking reproachfully of Devadatta, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, with a view to destroy the Tathāgata, Devadatta hired bowmen, hurled down a rock, and let loose the elephant Dhanapālaka; in every way he goes about to slay the One with Ten Powers.&rdquo; Entering and seating himself on the seat prepared for him, the Teacher asked, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, what is theme you are discussing here in a meeting?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;we were discussing the wickedness of Devadatta, saying that he was always going about to slay you.&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;It is not only in these present days, monks, that Devadatta goes about seeking to slay me; he went about with the like intent in bygone days also &ndash; but was unable to slay me.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a young monkey in the Himālayas region. And when fully grown he lived on the banks of the Ganges. Now a certain female crocodile in the Ganges conceived a longing for the flesh of the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s heart, and told it to her husband. He thought: &ldquo;I will kill the Bodhisatta by plunging him in the water and will take his heart&rsquo;s flesh and give it to my wife.&rdquo; So he said to the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Come, my friend, we will go and eat wild fruits on a certain island.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;How shall I get there?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will put you on my back and bring you there,&rdquo; answered the crocodile.</p>
<p class="p7">Innocent of the crocodile&rsquo;s purpose he jumped on his back and sat there. The crocodile after swimming a little way began to dive. Then the monkey said: &ldquo;Why, sir, do you plunge me into the water?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am going to kill you,&rdquo; said the crocodile, &ldquo;and give your heart&rsquo;s flesh to my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Foolish fellow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you suppose my heart is inside me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Then where have you put it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Do you not see it hanging there on yonder fig tree?&rdquo; &ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; said the crocodile.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But will you give it me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; said the monkey.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the crocodile &ndash; so foolish was he &ndash; took him and swam to the foot of the fig tree on the river bank. The Bodhisatta springing from the crocodile&rsquo;s back perched on the fig tree and repeated these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Have I from water, fish, to dry land passed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Only to fall into your power at last?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Of bread fruit and rose apples I am sick,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And rather figs than yonder mangoes pick.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. He that to great occasion fails to rise</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Neath foeman&rsquo;s feet in sorrow prostrate lies: </span><span class="t18">{3.134}</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Needs never dread oppression from his foe.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Bodhisatta in these four verses tell how to succeed in worldly affairs, and forthwith disappeared in the thicket of trees.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having brought his lesson to an end, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Devadatta was the crocodile, and I myself was the monkey.&rdquo;</span></p>

She carried messages, they say, for the king, and had two young ones. The king sent this bird with a letter to some other king. When she was gone away, the boys in the royal family squeezed the young birds to death with their hands. The mother bird came back and missing her young ones, asked who had killed her offspring. They said: &ldquo;So and so.&rdquo; And at this time there was a fierce and savage tiger kept in the palace, fastened by a strong chain. Now these boys came to see the tiger and the heron went with them, thinking: &ldquo;Even as my young ones were killed by them, just so will I deal with these boys,&rdquo; and she took hold of them and threw them down at the foot of the tiger. The tiger with a growl crunched them up. The bird said: &ldquo;Now is the wish of my heart fulfilled,&rdquo; and flying up into the air made straight for the Himālayas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On hearing what had happened they started a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying, </span><span class="t18">{3.135}</span><a id="a8702"></a><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Sirs, a heron, it is said, in the king&rsquo;s palace threw down before a tiger the boys who killed her young ones, and when she had thus brought about their death, she made off.&rdquo; The Teacher came and inquired what it was the monks were discussing and said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but formerly also did she bring about the death of those who killed her young ones.&rdquo; And herewith he related a legend of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past the Bodhisatta at Benares ruled his kingdom with justice and equity. A certain heron in his house carried messages for him. And so on just as before. But the special point here is that in this case the bird, having let the tiger kill the boys, thought: &ldquo;I can no longer remain here. I will take my departure, but though I am going away I will not leave without telling the king, but as soon as I have told him I will be off.&rdquo; And so she drew nigh and saluted the king, and standing a little way off said: &ldquo;My lord, it was through your carelessness that the boys killed my young ones, and under the influence of passion I in revenge caused their death. Now I can no longer live here.&rdquo; And uttering the first verse she said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Long I held this house as mine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Honour great I did receive,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">It is due to act of thine</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I am now compelled to leave.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king on hearing this repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Should one to retaliate,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wrong with equal wrong repay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then his anger should abate;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So, good heron, pray you stay.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.90] {3.136}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this the bird spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Wronged can with wrong-doer ne&rsquo;er</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As of old be made at one:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nought, O king, can keep me here,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lo! From henceforth I am gone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king, on hearing this, spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Should they wise, not foolish be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With the wronged wrong-doer may</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So, good heron, pray you, stay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The bird said: &ldquo;As things are, I cannot stay, my lord,&rdquo; and saluting the king she flew up into the air and made straight for the Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The heron in the former tale was the heron in this, but the king of Benares was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

When he was old, they say, he became an ascetic and built himself a hut of leaves in a mango orchard on the outskirts of Jetavana, and not only himself continually ate the ripe fruit that fell from the mango trees, but also gave some to his kinsfolk. When he had set out on his round of alms-begging, some thieves knocked down his mangoes, and ate some and went off with others. At this moment the four daughters of a rich merchant, after bathing in the river Aciravatī, in wandering about strayed into the mango orchard. When the old man returned and found them there, he charged them with having eaten his mangoes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we have but just come; we have not eaten your mangoes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Then take an oath,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;We will, sir,&rdquo; they said, and took an oath. The old man having thus put them to shame, by making them take an oath, let them go.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks, hearing of his action, raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, how that an old man exacted an oath from the daughters of a merchant, who entered the mango orchard where he himself lived, and after putting them to shame by administering an oath to them, let them go. When the Teacher came and on inquiring what was the topic they sat in council to discuss, heard what it was, he said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but formerly also this old man, when he kept watch over mangoes, made certain daughters of a rich merchant take an oath, and after thus putting them to shame let them go.&rdquo; And so saying he told a story of the past.</span><span class="t18"> [3.91]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta became Sakka. At that time a cheating ascetic built a hermitage of leaves in a mango orchard on a river bank near Benares, and keeping watch over the mangoes, ate the ripe fruit that fell from the mango trees and also gave some to his kinsfolk, and dwelt there gaining his livelihood by various false practices.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8710"></a>At this time Sakka, king of heaven, thought: &ldquo;Who, I wonder, in this world of men support their parents, pay honour to the aged members of their family, give alms, keep the moral law and observe fast day? Which of them after adopting the ascetic life, continually devote themselves to the duties befitting ascetics, and which of them again are guilty of misconduct?&rdquo; And exploring the world he spied this wicked ascetic keeping watch over his mangoes <span class="t18">{3.138}</span> and said: &ldquo;This false ascetic, abandoning his duties as an ascetic, such as focusing on the Meditation Object and the like, is continually watching a mango orchard. I will frighten him soundly.&rdquo; So when he was gone into the village for alms, Sakka by his supernatural power knocked down the mangoes, and made as if they had been plundered by thieves. At this moment four daughters of a merchant of Benares entered the orchard, and the false ascetic on seeing them stopped them and said: &ldquo;You have eaten my mangoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">They said: &ldquo;Sir, we have but just come. We have not eaten them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Then take an oath,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But in that case may we go?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;Certainly, you may.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; they said, and the eldest of them swore an oath uttering the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;She that did your mangoes eat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As her lord shall own some churl,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That with dye grey hairs would cheat</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And his locks with tongs would curl.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The ascetic said: &ldquo;Stand you on one side,&rdquo; and he made the second daughter of the merchant take an oath, and she repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Let the maid that robbed your tree</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vainly for a husband sigh,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And on thirty verging nigh.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And after she had taken an oath and stood on one side, the third maiden uttered the third verse: <span class="t18">{3.139}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;She that your ripe mangoes ate</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Weary path shall tread alone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And at trysting place too late</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Grieve to find her lover gone.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.92]</span></p>
<p class="p6">When she had taken an oath and stood aside, the fourth maiden uttered the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;She that did your tree despoil</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gaily dressed, with wreath on head,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And bedewed with sandal oil</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Still shall seek a virgin bed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The ascetic said: &ldquo;This is a solemn oath you have taken; others must have eaten the mangoes. Do you therefore now be gone.&rdquo; And so saying, he sent them away. Sakka then presented himself in a terrible form, and drove away the false ascetic from the place.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time this false ascetic was the old man who watched mangoes. The four merchant&rsquo;s daughters played the same part then as now. But Sakka was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

And after giving his heart to the dispensation and taking ordination, he became slothful, and as regards questioning, enquiring, devotion and the round of monastic duties, he did not fully enter into them, being overcome by his hindrances, and was always to be found at public lounging-places.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks discussed his sloth in the Dhamma Hall, saying: &ldquo;Such a one, sirs, after taking ordination in so excellent a dispensation that leads to safety, is continually slothful and indolent, and overcome by his hindrances.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.140}</span><span class="t30"> When the Teacher came and inquired what the monks were assembled to discuss, on being told what it was, he said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but formerly too was he slothful.&rdquo; And so saying he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta became his valued minister. The king of Benares was of a slothful disposition, and the Bodhisatta went about considering some means to rouse the king. Now one day the king went to his garden, accompanied by his minister, and while wandering about there he espied a slothful turtle. Lazy creatures like these, they say, though they are in motion a whole day, move only just an inch or two. <span class="t18">[3.93]</span></p>
<p class="p7">The king on seeing it asked, saying: &ldquo;Friend, what is its name?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta answered, &ldquo;The creature is called a turtle, great king; and is so lazy that though it is in motion all day, it only moves just an inch or two.&rdquo; And addressing it he said: &ldquo;Ho! Sir turtle, yours is a slow motion. Supposing a conflagration arose in the forest, what would you do?&rdquo; And herewith he spoke the first verse:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;You that of late.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher while at Jetavana told concerning the meal of the faithful.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">In the house of Anāthapiṇdika, they say, five hundred monks were constantly fed. </span><span class="t18">{3.142}</span><span class="t30"> The house was continually like a place of refreshment for the assembly of the monks, bright with the sheen of their yellow robes and blown upon with saintly odours. So one day the king in making a solemn procession </span><span class="t18">[3.94] </span><span class="t30">round the city caught sight of the assembly of the monks in the Treasurer&rsquo;s house, and thinking: &ldquo;I too will grant a perpetual alms to the assembly of saints,&rdquo; he went to the monastery and after greeting the Teacher he instituted perpetual alms for five hundred monks. Thenceforth there was a perpetual giving of alms in the king&rsquo;s house, even choice food of rice with the perfume of the rain upon it, but there are none to give it with their own hands, with marks of affection and faith, but the king&rsquo;s ministers dispense the food, and the monks do not care to sit down and eat it, but taking the various dainty foods, they go each to the house of his own retainers, and giving them the food, themselves eat whatever is set before them, whether coarse or dainty.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now one day much wild fruit was brought to the king. The king said: &ldquo;Give it to the Saṅgha of monks.&rdquo; They went to the refectory and came and told the king, &ldquo;There is not a single monk there.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;What, is it not time yet?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Yes it is time,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;but the monks take the food in your house, and then go to the abode of their trusty servitors, and give the food to them, and themselves eat whatsoever is served up to them, whether it be coarse or dainty.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The king said: &ldquo;Our food is dainty. Why in the world do they abstain from ours and eat some other food?&rdquo; And thinking: &ldquo;I will inquire of the Teacher,&rdquo; he went to the monastery and asked him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8726"></a><a id="a8727"></a><span class="t30">The Teacher said: &ldquo;The best food is that which is given in faith. Owing to the absence of those who by giving in faith establish friendly feeling, the monks take the food and eat it in some friendly place of their own. There is no flavour, sire, equal to that of faith. That which is given without faith, though it be composed of the four sweet things, is not worth so much as wild rice given with faith. Wise men of old, when sickness arose amongst them, though the king with his five families of leeches provided remedies, if the sickness were not thus assuaged, repaired to their intimate friends and by eating broth of wild rice and millet, without salt, or even leaves without salt, sprinkled with water only, were healed of their sickness.&rdquo; And with these words at their request he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family in the kingdom of Kāsi, <span class="t18">{3.143}</span><a id="a8728"></a> and they called him young Kappa [Kappakumāra]. When he came of age, he acquired all the arts at Taxila and afterwards adopted the ascetic life. At this time an ascetic named Kesava attended by five hundred other ascetics became the teacher of a band of disciples and lived in the Himālayas. The Bodhisatta came to him and becoming the senior of the five hundred pupils, dwelt there and showed a friendly feeling and affection for Kesava. And they became very close to one another.</p>
<p class="p7">By and by Kesava accompanied by these ascetics went to Benares to procure salt and vinegar and lodged in the king&rsquo;s garden. Next day he went into the city and came to the palace door. When the king saw the band of holy men, he invited them in and fed them in his own house, and exacting the usual promise from them, he lodged them in his garden. So when the rainy season was over, Kesava took leave of the king. The king said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, you are an old man. Do you now dwell near us, and send <span class="t18">[3.95] </span>the young ascetics to the Himālayas.&rdquo; He agreed and sent them with the head disciple to the Himālayas and himself was left quite alone. Kappa went to the Himālayas and dwelt there with the ascetics. Kesava was unhappy at being deprived of the society of Kappa, and in his desire to see him got no sleep, and in consequence of losing his sleep, his food was not properly digested. A bloody flux set in, followed by severe pains. The king with his five families of leeches watched over the ascetic, but his sickness abated not.</p>
<p class="p7">The ascetic asked the king, &ldquo;Do you, sire, wish for me to die or to recover?&rdquo; &ldquo;To recover, sir,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Then send me to the Himālayas,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said the king, and sent to a minister named Nārada, and bade him go with some foresters and take the holy man to the Himālayas. Nārada took him there and returned home. But by the mere sight of Kappa, Kesava&rsquo;s mental disorder ceased and his unhappiness subsided. <span class="t18">{3.144}</span> So Kappa gave him broth made of millet and wild rice together with leaves sprinkled with water, without salt and spices, and at that very instant the dysentery was assuaged.</p>
<p class="p7">The king again sent Nārada saying: &ldquo;Go and learn tidings of the ascetic Kesava.&rdquo; He came and finding him recovered said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, the king of Benares treating you with his five families of leeches could not heal your sickness. How did Kappa treat you?&rdquo; And herewith he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;You that of late with lord of men did dwell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A king prepared to grant your heart&rsquo;s desire,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What is the charm of Kappa&rsquo;s ascetic cell</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That blessed Kesava should here retire?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Kesava on hearing this repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;All here is charming: e&rsquo;en the very trees</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O Nārada, my fancy take,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Kappa&rsquo;s words that never fail to please</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A grateful echo in my heart awake.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After these words he said: &ldquo;Kappa by way of pleasing me gave me to drink broth made of millet and wild rice mixed with leaves sprinkled with water, and without salt and spices, and therewith was my bodily sickness stayed and I was healed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Nārada, hearing this, repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;You that but now the purest rice did eat</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Boiled with a dainty flavouring of meat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How can you relish such insipid fare</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And millet and wild rice with ascetics share?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.96] {3.145}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this Kesava uttered the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;The food may coarse or dainty prove,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May scanty be or much abound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet if the meal is blessed with faith,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Love the best sauce by far is found.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Nārada on hearing his words returned to the king and told him, &ldquo;Kesava says thus and thus.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8729"></a><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the king was Ānanda, Nārada was Sāriputta, Kesava was Bakabrahmā,</span><a id="a8730"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15509"><span class="t9">{605}</span></a><span class="t30"> Kappa was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

The incident that led to the story will be set forth in the Mahākaṇhajātaka [Ja 469].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8741"></a><a id="a8742"></a><a id="a8743"></a><span class="t34">One day, they say, the monks as they sat in the Dhamma Hall, were talking together. &ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; one would say, &ldquo;the Teacher, ever practising friendship towards the multitudes of the people, has forsaken an agreeable abode, and lives just for the good of the world. He has attained supreme wisdom, yet of his own accord takes bowl and robe, and goes on a journey of eighteen leagues or more. For the five elders he set rolling the Wheel of the Dhamma; on the fifth day of the half-month he recited the Anattalakkhaṇa discourse, and made them Arahats; he went to Uruveḷa, and to the ascetics with matted hair he showed three and a half thousand miracles, and persuaded them to join the Saṅgha; at Gayāsīsa he taught the Discourse upon Fire, and made a thousand of these ascetics Arahats; to Mahākassapa, when he had gone forward three miles to meet him, after three discourses he gave the higher ordination; all alone, after the noon-day meal, he went a journey of forty-five leagues, and then established in the Fruit of the Third Path Pukkusa (a youth of very good birth); to meet Mahākappina he went forward a space of two thousand leagues, and made him an Arahat; alone, in the afternoon he went a journey of thirty leagues, and made that cruel and harsh man Aṅgulimāla an Arahat; thirty leagues also he traversed, and established Āḷavaka in the Fruit of the First Path, and saved the prince; in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three he dwelt three months, and taught Abhidhamma to eight hundred millions of deities; to the Brahmā Realm he went, and destroyed the false Dhamma of Baka Brahmā, and made ten thousand Brahmās Arahats; every year he goes on pilgrimage in three districts, and to such men as are capable of receiving, he gives the refuges, the precepts, and the Fruits of the different stages; he even acts for the good of Nāgas and Garuḷas and the like, in many ways.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">In such words they praised the goodness and worth of the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; life for the good of the world. The Teacher came in, and asked what they talked about as they sat there? They told him. &ldquo;And no wonder, monks,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I who now in my perfect wisdom would live for the world&rsquo;s good, even I in the past, in the days of passion, lived for the good of the world.&rdquo; So saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as the son of his chief queen. And when he was of age, he was instructed in all the arts and on the death of his father was established in his kingdom and governed it righteously.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time men were devoted to the worship of the gods <a id="a8744"></a><span class="t18">{3.146}</span> and made offerings to them by the slaughter of many goats, rams and the like. The Bodhisatta proclaimed by beat of drum, &ldquo;No living creature is to be put to death.&rdquo; The Yakkhas were enraged against the Bodhisatta at losing their offerings, and calling together an assembly of their kind in the Himalāyas, they sent forth a certain savage Yakkha to slay the Bodhisatta. He took a huge blazing mass of iron as big as the dome of a <span class="t18">[3.97] </span>house, and thinking to strike a deadly blow, immediately after the mid watch, came and stood at the bed&rsquo;s head of the Bodhisatta. At that instant the throne of Sakka manifested signs of heat. After considering the matter the god discovered the cause, and grasping his thunderbolt in his hand he came and stood over the Yakkha. The Bodhisatta on seeing the Yakkha thought: &ldquo;Why in the world is he standing here? Is it to protect me, or from a desire to slay me?&rdquo; And as he talked with him he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Why in mid air, O Yakkha, do you stand</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With that huge bolt of iron in your hand?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Are you to guard me from all harm intent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or here today for my destruction sent?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now the Bodhisatta saw only the Yakkha. He did not see Sakka. The Yakkha through fear of Sakka did not strike the Bodhisatta. On hearing the words of the Bodhisatta the Yakkha said: &ldquo;Great king, I am not stationed here to guard you; I came minded to smite you with this blazing mass of iron, but through fear of Sakka I dare not strike you.&rdquo; And to explain his meaning he uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;As messenger of Rakkhasas, lo! here</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To compass your destruction I appear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But all in vain the fiery bolt I wield</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Against the head that Sakka&rsquo;s self would shield.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the Bodhisatta repeated two more verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;If Sakka, Sujā&rsquo;s lord, in heaven that reigns,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Great king of gods, my cause to champion deigns, </span><span class="t18">{3.147}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8745"></a><a id="a8746"></a><span class="t12">With hideous howl Pisācas rend the sky,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No Rakkhasas have power to terrify.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Let mud Pisācas gibber as they may,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They are not equal to so stern a fray.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did Sakka put the Yakkha to flight. And exhorting the Great Being, he said: &ldquo;Great king, fear not. Henceforth we will protect you. Be not afraid.&rdquo; And so saying he returned straight to his own place of abode.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher here ended his lesson and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Anuruddha was Sakka, and I myself was the king of Benares.&rdquo;</span></p>

The incident that led up to the story will be set forth in the Cullanāradakassapajātaka [Ja 477].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about the allurements of a sensual girl.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">There was then, we learn, a girl of about sixteen, daughter of a citizen of Sāvatthi, such as might bring good luck to a man, yet no man chose her. So her mother thought to herself, &ldquo;This my daughter is of full age, yet no one chooses her. I will use her as bait for a fish, and make one of those Sākiyan ascetics come back to the world, and live upon him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8755"></a><span class="t34">At the time there was a young man of good birth living in Sāvatthi, who had given his heart to the dispensation and went forth. But from the time when he had received full ordination he had lost all desire for learning, and lived devoted to the adornment of his person.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The lay sister used to prepare in her house rice gruel, and other food hard or soft, and standing at the door, as the monks walked along the streets, looked out for someone who could be tempted by the craving for delicacies. Streaming by went a crowd of monks who upheld the Three Baskets, including the Abhidhamma and the Vinaya; but among them she saw none ready to rise to her bait. Among the figures with bowl and robe, preachers of the Dhamma with honey-sweet voice, moving like fleecy scud before the wind, she saw not one.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But at last she perceived a man approaching, the outer corners of his eyes anointed, hair hanging down, wearing an under-robe of fine cloth, and an outer robe shaken and cleansed, bearing a bowl coloured like some precious gem, and a sunshade after his own heart, a man who let his senses have their own way, his body much bronzed. &ldquo;Here is a man I can catch!&rdquo; thought she; and greeting him, she took his bowl, and invited him into the house. She found him a seat, and provided rice gruel and all the rest; then after the meal, begged him to make that house his resort in future. So he used to visit the house after that, and in course of time became intimate.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">One day, the lay sister said in his hearing, &ldquo;In this household we are happy enough, only I have no son or son-in-law capable of keeping it up.&rdquo; The man heard it, and wondering what reason she could have for so saying, in a little while he was as it were pierced to the heart. She said to her daughter, &ldquo;Tempt this man, and get him into your power.&rdquo; So the girl after that time decked herself and adorned herself, and tempted him with all women&rsquo;s tricks and wiles. Then the man, being young and under the power of passion, thought in his heart, &ldquo;I cannot now hold on to the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation,&rdquo; and he went to the monastery, and laying down bowl and robe, said to his spiritual teachers, &ldquo;I am discontented.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then they conducted him to the Teacher, and said: &ldquo;Sir, this monk is discontented.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is this true which they say,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;that you are discontented, monk?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir, true it is.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then what made you so?&rdquo; &ldquo;A sensual girl, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monk,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;long, long ago, when you were living in the forest, this same girl was a hindrance to your holiness, and did you great harm; then why are you again discontented on her account?&rdquo; Then at the request of the monks he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin household. And when he grew up and was learned in all the arts at Taxila, his wife died and he adopted the ascetic life and went with his son to dwell in the Himālayas. There leaving his son in a hermitage, he went forth to gather all kinds of fruit. At that time as some brigands were harrying a border village, and were going off with their prisoners, a certain damsel fled for refuge to this hermitage <span class="t18">{3.148}</span> and by her seductions corrupted the virtue of the youth. She said to him, &ldquo;Come, let us begone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Let my father first return,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and after I have seen him, I will go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, when you have seen him, come to me,&rdquo; she said. And going out she sat herself down in the middle of the road. The young ascetic, when his father had come, spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;This doubt, my father, solve for me, I pray;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If to some village from this wood I stray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Men of what school of morals, or what sect</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Shall I most wisely for my friends affect?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then his father, by way of warning him, repeated three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;One that can gain your confidence and love,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Can trust your word, and with you patient prove,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. In thought and word and deed will ne&rsquo;er offend &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Take to your heart and cling to him as friend.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. To men capricious as the monkey-kind</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And found unstable, be not you inclined,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though to some desert you should be confined.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.149}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the young ascetic said: &ldquo;Dear father, how shall I find a man possessed of these virtues? I will not go. With you only will I live.&rdquo; And so saying he turned back. Then his father taught him how to <span class="t18">[3.99] </span>focus on the Meditation Object. And both father and son, without falling away from Absorption, became destined to birth in the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the youth and the maiden were the same as in the later story. The ascetic was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
