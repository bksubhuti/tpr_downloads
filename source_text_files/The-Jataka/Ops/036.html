<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the king of Kosala sits impartially in court judging the cases, before going to see the Buddha and declaring his acts. The Buddha tells a story of two just kings of old and how precedence was decided when they met on a bridge one day.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the king of Benares (Bārāṇasirājā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Sāriputta = the king of Benares&rsquo;s charioteer (Bārāṇasirañño sārathi),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a3143"></a><span class="t15">Ānando = king Mallika (Mallikarājā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Moggallāna = the king of Mallika&rsquo;s charioteer (Mallikarañño sārathi).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Rough to the rough.&rdquo;</span><a id="a3145"></a><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.1]</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{2.1}</span><a id="a3146"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while he was living in Jetavana, to explain how a king was taught a lesson. This will be set forth in the Tesakuṇajātaka [Ja 521].</span><a id="a3147"></a><a href="notes.html#a14990"><span class="t9">{367}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3148"></a><span class="t30">It is said that one day the king of Kosala had just passed sentence in a very difficult case involving moral wrong.</span><a id="a3149"></a><a href="notes.html#a14992"><span class="t9">{368}</span></a><span class="t30"> After his meal, with hands not yet dry, he proceeded in his splendid chariot to visit the Teacher; and the king saluted him, his feet beautiful like the open lotus flower, and sat down aside.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the Teacher addressed him in these words. &ldquo;Why, my lord king, what brings you here at this time of day?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I missed my time because I was sitting on a difficult case, involving moral wrong; now I have finished it, and eaten, and here I am, with my hands hardly dry, to wait upon you.&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord king,&rdquo; replied the Teacher, &ldquo;to judge a cause with justice and impartiality is the right thing; that is the way to heaven. Now when you first have the advice of a being all-wise like me, it is no wonder if you should judge your case fairly and justly; but the wonder is when kings have only had the advice of scholars who are not all-wise, and yet have decided fairly and justly, avoiding the Four Ways of Wickedness, and observing the Ten Royal Virtues, and after ruling justly have gone to swell the hosts of heaven.&rdquo; Then, at the king&rsquo;s request, he told a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{2.2}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3150"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was conceived by his queen consort; and the ceremonies proper to her state having been duly done,<a id="a3151"></a><a href="notes.html#a14994"><span class="t9">{369}</span></a> she was afterwards safely <span class="t18">[2.2] </span>delivered. On his name-day, the name they gave him was prince Brahmadatta.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3152"></a><a id="a3153"></a>In course of time, he grew up, and at sixteen years went to Taxila<a id="a3154"></a><a href="notes.html#a14996"><span class="t9">{370}</span></a> for his education; where he mastered all branches of learning, and on his father&rsquo;s death he became king in his stead, and ruled with uprightness and all rectitude, administering justice with no regard had to his own will or whim. And as he ruled thus justly, his ministers on their part were also just; thus, while all things were justly done, there was none who brought a false suit into court. Presently all the bustle of suitors ceased within the precincts of the palace; all day long the ministers might sit on the bench, and go away without seeing a single suitor. The courts were deserted.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the Bodhisatta thought to himself, &ldquo;Because of my just government not one suitor comes to try issue in court; the old hubbub is quiet; the courts of law are deserted. Now I must search whether I have any fault in me; which, if I find, I will eschew it, and live a good life hereafter.&rdquo; From that time he tried continually to find someone who would tell him of a fault; but of all who were about him at court he could not find one such; nothing could he hear but good of himself. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;they are all so much afraid of me that they say no ill of me but only good,&rdquo; and so he went about to try those who were outside his walls. But with these it was just the same. Then he made inquisition of the citizens at large, and outside the city questioned those who belonged to the suburbs at the four city gates. Still there was none who had any fault to find; nothing but praises could he hear. Lastly, with intent to try the countryside, he entrusted all government to his ministers, and mounted in his carriage, and taking only the driver with him, left the city in disguise. All the country he traversed, even to the frontier; <span class="t18">{2.3}</span> but not a fault-finder could he light upon; all he could hear was only his own praises. So back he turned from the marches, and set his face homewards again by the highroad.</p>
<p class="p7">Now it happened that at this very time Mallika, the king of Kosala, had done the very same thing. He too was a just king, and he had been searching for his faults; but amongst those about him there was none who had any fault to find; and hearing nothing but praise, he had been making enquiry throughout all the country, and had but then arrived at that same spot.</p>
<p class="p7">These two met, in a place where the carriage road was deeply sunk between two banks, and there was no room for one carriage to pass another.<span class="t18"> [2.3]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Get your carriage out of the way!&rdquo; said king Mallika&rsquo;s driver to the driver of the king of Benares.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;No, no, driver,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;out of the way with yours! Know that in this carriage sits the great monarch Brahmadatta, lord of the kingdom of Benares!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Not so, driver!&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;in this carriage sits the great king Mallika, lord of the realm of Kosala! It is for you to make way, and to give place to the carriage of our king!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s a king too,&rdquo; thought the driver of the king of Benares. &ldquo;What in the world is to be done?&rdquo; Then a thought struck him; he would enquire what should be the age of the two kings, so that the younger should give way to the elder. And he made enquiry of the other driver how old his king was; but he learned that both were of the same age. Thereupon he asked the extent of this king&rsquo;s power, wealth, and glory, and all points touching his caste and clan and his family; discovering that both of them had a country three hundred leagues long, and that they were alike in power, wealth, glory, and the nature of their family and lineage. Then he bethought him that place might be given to the better man; so he requested that the other driver should describe his master&rsquo;s virtues. The man replied by the first verse of poetry following, in which he set forth his monarch&rsquo;s faults as though they were so many virtues:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3155"></a><a id="a3156"></a><a id="a3157"></a><a id="a3158"></a><a id="a3159"></a><a id="a3160"></a><a id="a3161"></a><a id="a3162"></a><span class="t12">1. Daḷhaṁ daḷhassa khipati, Balliko, mudunā muduṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3163"></a><a id="a3164"></a><span class="t12">Sādhum-pi sādhunā jeti, asādhum-pi asādhunā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3165"></a><a id="a3166"></a><span class="t12">Etādiso ayaṁ rājā, maggā uyyāhi sārathī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a3167"></a><a id="a3168"></a><a id="a3169"></a><a id="a3170"></a><a id="a3171"></a><a id="a3172"></a><span class="t4">He pits the strong against the strong, Ballika, the soft with softness, the good overcomes with goodness, the bad overcomes with badness, of such a kind is this our king, get off the path, charioteer. </span><span class="t18">{2.4}</span></p>
<p class="p23">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the man of the king of Benares, &ldquo;is that all you have to say about your king&rsquo;s virtues?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;If these are his virtues, what must his vices be?&rdquo; &ldquo;Vices be it, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you will; but let us hear what your king&rsquo;s virtues may be like!&rdquo; &ldquo;Listen then,&rdquo; rejoined the first, and repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3173"></a><a id="a3174"></a><span class="t12">2. Akkodhena jine kodhaṁ, asādhuṁ sādhunā jine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3175"></a><a id="a3176"></a><span class="t12">Jine kadar</span><span class="t46">i</span><span class="t12">yaṁ dānena, saccenālikavādinaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Etādiso ayaṁ rājā, maggā uyyāhi sārathī ti!</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a3177"></a><a id="a3178"></a><a id="a3179"></a><span class="t4">He overcomes anger with non-anger, overcomes bad with goodness, overcomes stinginess with a gift, and lying speech with the truth, of such a kind is this our king, get off the path, charioteer!</span></p>
<p class="p23">At these words both king Mallika and his driver descended from their carriage, and loosed the horses, and moved it out of the way, to give place to the king of Benares. Then the king of Benares gave good admonition to king Mallika, saying: &ldquo;Thus and thus <span class="t18">{2.5}</span> must you do,&rdquo; after which he returned to Benares, and there gave alms and did good all his life, till at the last he went to swell the hosts of heaven. And king Mallika took the lesson to heart; and after traversing the length and breadth of the <span class="t18">[2.4] </span>land, and lighting upon none who had any fault to find, returned to his own city; where he gave alms all his life and did good, till at the end he too went to swell the hosts of heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, which he began for the purpose of giving a lesson to the king of Kosala, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Moggallāna was then the driver of king Mallika, Ānanda was the king, Sāriputta was the driver of the king of Benares, but I myself was the king.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a3185"></a><span class="t15">In the present a barber falls in love with a highborn lady and dies while his love is unreciprocated. The Buddha tells how, in a past life, a jackal fell in love with a lioness, but was rejected by her; and how her brothers, trying to avenge her, and the jackal himself, all came to a bad end.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the elder lion (jeṭṭhabhātikasīho),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Who rashly undertakes.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying in his gabled chamber, about a barber who lived at Vesāli.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3187"></a><span class="t30">This man, as we are told, used to do shaving and hairdressing and cross-plaiting for the royal household, kings and queens, princes and princesses, indeed he did all of that kind that had to be done. He was a true believer, sheltered in the Three Refuges,</span><a id="a3188"></a><a href="notes.html#a14999"><span class="t9">{371}</span></a><span class="t30"> resolved to keep the Five Precepts; and from time to time he would listen to the Teacher&rsquo;s discourses.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day he set out to do his work in the palace, taking his son with him. The young fellow, seeing a Licchavi girl dressed up fine and grand, like a </span><span class="t30">Devaccharā</span><span class="t30">, fell in love for desire of her. He said to his father, as they left the palace in company, &ldquo;There is a girl, if I get her, I shall live; but if I don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s nothing but death for me.&rdquo; He would not touch a morsel of food, but lay down hugging the bedstead. His father found him and said: &ldquo;Why, son, don&rsquo;t set your mind on forbidden fruit. You are a nobody, a barber&rsquo;s son; this Licchavi girl is a highborn lady. You&rsquo;re no match for her. I&rsquo;ll find you somebody else; a girl of your own place and station.&rdquo; But the lad would not listen to him. Then came mother, brother, and sister, aunt and uncle, all his kinsfolk, and all his friends and companions, trying to pacify him; but pacify him they could not. So he pined and pined away, and lay there until he died.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the father performed his obsequies, and did what is usual to do for the spirits of the dead. </span><span class="t18">{2.6}</span><a id="a3189"></a><span class="t30"> By and by, when the first edge of grief had worn off, he thought he would wait upon the Teacher. Taking a large present of flowers, scents, and perfumes, he repaired to the Great Grove, and did reverence to the Teacher, saluted him, and sat down on one side. &ldquo;Why have you kept out of sight all this time, layman?&rdquo; the Teacher asked. Then the man told him what had happened. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Ah, layman, &rsquo;tis not the first time he has perished by setting his heart on what he must not have; this is only what he has done before.&rdquo; Then at the layman&rsquo;s request, he told a story of the past.</span><span class="t18"> [2.5]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta came into the world as a young lion in the region of the Himālayas. Of the same family there were some younger brothers, and one sister; and all of them lived in a Golden Cave.</p>
<p class="p7">Now nearby this cave was a Cave of Crystal on a silver hill, where a jackal lived. By and by the lions lost their parents by the stroke of death. Then they used to leave the lioness, their sister, behind in the cave, while they ranged for food; which when they obtained, they would bring it back for her to eat.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the jackal had caught sight of this lioness, and fell in love with her; but while the old lion and lioness lived, he could win no access. Now, when the seven brothers went to seek food, out he came from his Crystal Cave, and made all haste to the Golden Cave; where, taking his stand before the young lioness, he addressed her slyly with these seductive and tempting words:</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;O lioness, I am a fourfoot creature, and so are you. Therefore do you be my mate, and I will be your husband! We will live together in friendship and amity, and you shall love me always!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Now on hearing this the lioness thought to herself, &ldquo;This jackal here is mean amongst beasts, vile, and like a man of low caste: but I am esteemed to be one of royal issue. That he to me should so speak is unseemly and evil. How can I live after hearing such things said? I will hold my breath until I shall die. &ldquo;Then, bethinking her awhile, &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to die so would not be comely. My brothers will soon be home again; I will <span class="t18">{2.7}</span> tell them first, and then I will put an end to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The jackal, finding that no answer came, felt sure she cared nothing for him; so back he went to his Crystal Cave, and lay down in much misery.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3190"></a>Now one of the young lions, having killed a buffalo, or an elephant, or what not, himself ate some of it, and brought back a share for his sister, which he gave her, inviting her to eat. &ldquo;No, brother,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;not a bite will I eat; for I must die!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why must that be?&rdquo; he asked. And she told him what had happened. &ldquo;Where is this jackal now?&rdquo; he asked. She saw him lying in the Crystal Cave, and thinking he was up in the sky,<a id="a3191"></a><a href="notes.html#a15001"><span class="t9">{372}</span></a> she said: &ldquo;Why, brother, cannot you see him there on Silver Mountain, lying up in the sky?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The young lion, unaware that the jackal lay in a Crystal Cave, and deeming that he was truly in the sky, made a spring, as lions do, to kill him, and struck against the crystal: which burst his heart asunder, and falling to the foot of the mountain, he perished straightaway. <span class="t18">[2.6]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Then came in another, to whom the lioness told the same tale. This lion did even as the first, and fell dead by the mountain foot.</p>
<p class="p7">When six of the brother lions had perished in this way, last of all entered the Bodhisatta. When she had told her story, he enquired where was the jackal now? &ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;up in the sky, above Silver Mountain!&rdquo; The Bodhisatta thought: &ldquo;Jackals lying in the sky? Nonsense. I know what it is: he is lying in a Crystal Cave.&rdquo; So he repaired to the mountain&rsquo;s foot, and there he saw his six brothers lying dead. &ldquo;I see how it is,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;these were all foolish, and lacked the fulness of wisdom; not knowing that this is the Crystal Cave, they beat their hearts out against it, and were killed. This is what comes of acting in rashness without due reflection,&rdquo; and he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Asamekkhitakammantaṁ turitābhinipātinaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sāni kammāni tappenti,&nbsp; uṇhaṁ vajjhohitaṁ&nbsp; mukhe ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Those who quickly undertake work, without consideration, fall, they regret those works, like they would something hot crammed into the mouth. </span><span class="t18">{2.8}</span></p>
<p class="p23">After repeating these lines, the lion continued, &ldquo;My brothers wanted to kill this jackal, but did not have skill in means; so they leapt up too quickly at him, and so came by their death. This I will not do; but I will make the jackal burst his own heart as he lies there in the Crystal Cave.&rdquo; So he espied out the path whereby the jackal used to go up and down, and turning that way he roared thrice the lion&rsquo;s roar, that earth and heaven together were all one great roaring! The jackal lying in the Crystal Cave was frightened and astounded, so that his heart burst; and he perished on the spot incontinently.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher continued, &ldquo;Thus did this jackal perish on hearing the lion roar.&rdquo; And, after Fully Awakening, he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Sīho ca sīhanādena Daddaraṁ abhinādayi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sutvā sīhassa nigghosaṁ, siṅgālo Daddare vasaṁ</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bhīto santāsam-āpādi, hadayañ-cassa apphalī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">The lion resounded with a lion&rsquo;s roar on the mount Daddara, having heard the lion&rsquo;s shout, a jackal who dwelt near Daddara experienced fright, became terrified, and his heart burst apart. </span><span class="t18">{2.9}</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus did our lion do this jackal to death. Then he laid his brothers together in one grave, and told the sister they were dead, and comforted her; and he lived the rest of his days in the Golden Cave, until he passed away to the place which his merits had earned for him.<span class="t18"> [2.7]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he revealed the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths, the layman was established in the Fruit of the First Path. &ldquo;The barber&rsquo;s son of today was then the jackal; the Licchavi girl was the young lioness; the six younger lions are now six elders; and I myself was the eldest lion.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present after Ven. Sāriputta has given a discourse, one old monk thinks to make himself look good by asking a nonsensical question. Instead, however, he is chased away and falls into a cesspit. The Buddha tells how in a previous life as a boar he had challenged a lion, and, later, realising his mistake, had covered himself in offal to ward off sure death.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the lion (sīha),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the elderly man = the boar.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;You are a fourfoot.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This is a story told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a certain elder well stricken in years.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3201"></a><a id="a3202"></a><span class="t30">Once, we are told, there happened to be a night service, and the Teacher had preached standing upon a slab of the jewelled staircase at the door of his scented cell. After delivering a Sugata&rsquo;s discourse, he retired into his scented chamber; and the Captain of the Dhamma, saluting his Teacher, went back to his own cell again. Mahāmoggallāna too retired to his cell, and after a moment&rsquo;s rest returned to ask the elder Sāriputta a question. As he asked and asked each question, the Captain of the Dhamma made it all clear, as though he were making the moon rise in the sky. There were present the four classes of disciples,</span><a id="a3203"></a><a href="notes.html#a15005"><span class="t9">{374}</span></a><span class="t30"> who sat and heard it all.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3204"></a><span class="t30">Then a thought came into the mind of one aged elder. &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;I can puzzle Sāriputta before all this crowd, by asking him some question? They will all think, &lsquo;What a clever fellow!&rsquo; And I shall gain great credit and repute.&rdquo; So he rose up in the crowd, and stepping near to the elder, stood on one side, and said: &ldquo;Friend Sāriputta, I too have a question for you; will you let me speak? Give me a decision in discrimination or in undiscrimination, in refutation or in acceptation, in distinction or in counter-distinction.&rdquo;</span><a id="a3205"></a><a href="notes.html#a15007"><span class="t9">{375}</span></a><span class="t30"> The elder looked at him. &ldquo;This old man,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;stands within the sphere of desire still; he is empty, and knows nothing.&rdquo; He said not a single word to him for very shame; laying his fan down, he rose from his seat, </span><span class="t18">{2.10}</span><span class="t30"> and returned to his cell. And elder Moggallāna likewise returned to his cell.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The bystanders jumped up, crying, &ldquo;Seize this wicked old fellow, who wouldn&rsquo;t let us hear the sweet words of the sermon!&rdquo; and they mobbed him. Off he ran, and fell through a hole in the corner of a cesspool just outside the monastery; when he got up he was covered all over with filth. When the people saw him, they felt sorry for it, and went away to the Teacher. He asked, &ldquo;Why have you come at this unseasonable hour, laymen?&rdquo; They told him what had happened. &ldquo;Laymen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is not the only time this old man has been pulled up, and not knowing his own power, pitted himself against the strong, only to be covered all over with filth. Long, long ago he knew not his powers, pitted himself against the strong, and was covered with filth as he is covered now.&rdquo; Then, at their request, he told them a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">[2.8]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was a lion who dwelt in a mountain cave in the Himālayas. Hard by were a multitude of boars, living by a lakeside; and beside the same lake lived a company of ascetics in huts made of leaves and the branches of trees.</p>
<p class="p7">One day it so happened that the lion had brought down a buffalo or elephant or some such game; and, after eating what he listed, he went down to drink at this lake. Just as he came out, a sturdy boar happened to be feeding by the side of the water. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll make a meal for me some other day,&rdquo; thought the lion. But fearing that if the boar saw him, he might never come there again, the lion as he came up out of the water slunk away to the side. This the boar saw; and at once the thought came into his mind, &ldquo;This is because he has seen me, and is afraid! He dare not come nigh me, and off he runs for fear! This day shall see a fight between me and a lion!&rdquo; So he raised his head, and made challenge against the lion in the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Catuppado ahaṁ samma, tvam-pi samma catuppado,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ehi samma nivattassu, kiṁ nu bhīto palāyasī&rdquo; ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">&ldquo;I am four-footed, friend, you are four-footed, friend, come, friend, turn back, why do you run away in fear?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{2.11}</span></p>
<p class="p23">The lion gave ear. &ldquo;Friend boar,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;today there will be no fight between you and me. But this day next week let us fight it out in this very spot.&rdquo; And with these words, he departed.</p>
<p class="p7">The boar was highly delighted in thinking how he was to fight a lion; and he told all his kith and kin about it. But the tale only terrified them. &ldquo;You will be the bane of us all,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and yourself to boot. You know not what you can do, or you would not be so eager to do battle with a lion. When the lion comes, he&rsquo;ll be the death of you and all of us as well; do not be so violent!&rdquo; These words made the boar fear on his part. &ldquo;What am I to do, then?&rdquo; he asked. Then the other boars advised him to roll about in the ascetics&rsquo; dunghill for the next seven days, and let the muck dry on his body; then on the seventh day he should moisten himself with dewdrops, and be first at the trysting place; he must find how the wind should lie, and get to the windward; and the lion, being a cleanly creature, would spare his life when he had a whiff of him.</p>
<p class="p7">So accordingly he did; and on the day appointed, there he was. No sooner had the lion scented him, and smelt the filth, says he, &ldquo;Friend boar, a pretty trick this! Were you not all besmeared with filth, I should have had your life this very day. But as it is, bite you I cannot, nor so much as touch you with my foot. Therefore I spare your life.&rdquo; And then he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Asuci pūtilomosi, duggandho vāsi sūkara,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sace yujjhitukāmosi, jayaṁ samma dadāmi te&rdquo; ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">&ldquo;Your coat is foul, unclean, you truly smell bad, boar, if you desire to fight, I give you victory, friend.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[2.9]</span></p>
<p class="p23">Then the lion turned away, and procured his day&rsquo;s food; and anon, after a drink at the lake, he went back again to his cave on the mountain. And the boar told his kindred how he had beaten the lion! <span class="t18">{2.12}</span> But they were terrified for fear the lion should come again another day and be the death of them all. So they ran away and betook them to some other place.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The boar of those days is now the ancient elder, and I myself was the lion.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Concealed within a stone.&rdquo;</span><a id="a3216"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a soldiers&rsquo; quarrel.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Tradition tells how two soldiers, in the service of the king of Kosala, of high rank, and great persons at court, no sooner caught sight of one another than they used to exchange ill words. Neither king, nor friends, nor kinsfolk could make them agree.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">It happened one day that early in the morning the Teacher, looking around to see which of his disciples were ripe for release, perceived that these two were ready to enter upon the First Path. Next day he went all alone seeking alms in Sāvatthi, and stopped before the door of one of them, who came out and took the Teacher&rsquo;s bowl; then led him within, and offered him a seat. The Teacher sat, and then enlarged on the profit of cultivating loving-kindness. When he saw the man&rsquo;s mind was ready, he declared the Truths. This done, the other was established in the Fruit of the First Path. Seeing this, the Teacher persuaded him to take the bowl; then rising he proceeded to the house of the other. Out came the other, and after salutation given, begged the Teacher to enter, and gave him a seat. He also took the Teacher&rsquo;s bowl, and entered along with him. To him the Teacher lauded the Eleven Blessings of Loving-kindness;</span><a id="a3217"></a><a href="notes.html#a15009"><span class="t9">{376}</span></a><span class="t30"> and perceiving that his heart was ready, declared the Truths. And this done, he too became established in the Fruit of the First Path.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Thus they were both converted; they confessed their faults one to the other, and asked forgiveness; peaceful and harmonious, they were at one together. That very same day they ate together in the presence of the Fortunate One.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His meal over, the Teacher returned to the monastery. They both returned with him, bearing a rich present of flowers, scents and perfumes, of ghee, honey, and sugar. The Teacher, having preached of duty </span><span class="t18">{2.13}</span><span class="t30"> before the Saṅgha, and uttered a Sugata&rsquo;s discourse, retired to his scented chamber.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Next morning, the monks talked the matter over in the Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; one would say to another, &ldquo;our Teacher subdues the unsubdued.</span><span class="t18"> [2.10] </span><span class="t30">Why, here are these two grand persons, who have been quarrelling all this time, and could not be reconciled by the king himself, or friends and kinsfolk: and the Tathāgata has humbled them in a single day!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, &ldquo;What are you talking about,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;as you sit here together?&rdquo; They told him. Said he, &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time that I have reconciled these two; in bygone ages I reconciled the same two persons.&rdquo; And he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3218"></a><a id="a3219"></a>In the past, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, a great multitude gathered together in Benares to keep festival. Crowds of men and of gods, of Nāgas, and Supaṇṇas,<a id="a3220"></a><a href="notes.html#a15011"><span class="t9">{377}</span></a> came together to see the meeting.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3221"></a><a id="a3222"></a><a id="a3223"></a><a id="a3224"></a>It so happened that in one spot a Nāga and a Supaṇṇa were watching the goings-on together. The Nāga, not noticing that this was a Supaṇṇa beside him, laid a hand on his shoulder. And when the Supaṇṇa turned and looked round to see whose hand had been laid upon his shoulder, he saw the Nāga. The Nāga looked too, and saw that this was a Supaṇṇa; and frightened to death, he flew off over the surface of a river. The Supaṇṇa gave chase, to catch him.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3225"></a>Now the Bodhisatta was a recluse, and lived in a leaf-hut on the river bank. At that time he was trying to keep off the sun&rsquo;s heat by putting on a wet cloth and doffing his garment of bark; and he was bathing in the river. &ldquo;I will make this recluse,&rdquo; thought the Nāga, &ldquo;the means of saving my life.&rdquo; Putting off his own proper shape, and assuming the form of a fine jewel, he fixed himself upon the bark garment. The Supaṇṇa in full pursuit saw where he had gone; but for very reverence he would not touch the garment; so he thus addressed the Bodhisatta:</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sir, I am hungry. Look at your bark garment: in it there is a Nāga which I desire to eat.&rdquo; And to make the matter clear, he repeated the first verse: <span class="t18">{2.14}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Idhūragānaṁ pavaro paviṭṭho,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Selassa vaṇṇena, pamokkham-icchaṁ.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brahmañ-ca vaṇṇaṁ apacāyamāno,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bubhukkhito, no vitarāmi bhottun-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Here amongst the snakes the noble one has entered, being a rock with colour, desiring safety. Paying homage to the holy man of high class, though hungry, I overcame the desire to eat.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Standing where he was in the water, the Bodhisatta said the second verse in praise of the Supaṇṇa king:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. So Brahmagutto ciram-eva jīva,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dibyā ca te pātubhavantu bhakkhā.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yo brahmavaṇṇaṁ apacāyamāno,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bubhukkhito no vitarāsi bhottun-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Guarded by Brahmā, may you live for a long time, and may divine food manifest itself to you. Whoever, honouring the holy man of class, though hungry, you overcame the desire to eat.</span></p>
<p class="p23">In these words the Bodhisatta expressed his approval, standing there in the water. Then he came out, and put on his bark garment, and took <span class="t18">[2.11] </span>both creatures with him to his hermitage; where he rehearsed the blessings of Loving-kindness until they were both at one. Thenceforward they lived together happily in peace and harmony.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, saying: &ldquo;In those days, the two great personages were the Nāga and the Supaṇṇa, and I myself was the recluse.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Gagga, live a hundred years.</span><span class="t30">&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{2.15}</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told when he was staying in the monastery made by king Pasenadi in front of Jetavana; it was about a sneeze which he gave.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day, we are told, as the Teacher sat discoursing with four persons round him, he sneezed. &ldquo;Long life to the Fortunate One, long life to the Buddha!&rdquo; the monks all cried aloud, and made a great to-do.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The noise interrupted the discourse. Then the Teacher said to the monks, &ldquo;Why, monks, if one cry &lsquo;Long life!&rsquo; on hearing a sneeze, does a man live or die any the more for that?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;No, no, sir.&rdquo; He went on, &ldquo;You should not cry &lsquo;Long life&rsquo; for a sneeze, monks. Whosoever does so is guilty of wrong.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">It is said that at that time, when the monks sneezed, people used to call out, &ldquo;Long life to you, sir!&rdquo; But the monks had their scruples, and made no answer. Everybody was annoyed, and asked, &ldquo;Pray, why is it that the monastics about the ascetic Son of the Sakyas make no answer, when they sneeze, and somebody or other wishes them long life?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">All this was told to the Fortunate One. He said: &ldquo;Monks, common folk are superstitious. When you sneeze, and they say, &lsquo;Long life to you, sir!&rsquo; I permit you to answer, &lsquo;The same to you.&rsquo; &rdquo; Then the monks asked him, &ldquo;Sir, when did people begin to answer &lsquo;Long life&rsquo; by &lsquo;The same to you&rsquo;?&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;That was long, long ago,&rdquo; and he told them a tale of the olden time.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta came into the world as a brahmin&rsquo;s son of the kingdom of Kāsi; and his father was a lawyer by calling. When the lad was sixteen years old or so, his father gave a fine jewel into his charge, and they both <span class="t18">[2.12] </span><a id="a3234"></a><a id="a3235"></a>travelled through town after town, village after village, until they came to Benares. There the man had a meal cooked in the gatekeeper&rsquo;s house; and as he could find nowhere to put up, he asked where there was lodging to be had for wayfarers who came too late? The people told him that there was a building outside the city, but that it was haunted by Amanussas; but however he might lodge there if he liked. Says the lad to his father, &ldquo;Have no fear of any Yakkha, father! I will subdue him, and bring him to your feet.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.16}</span> So he persuaded his father, and they went to the place together. The father lay down upon a bench, and his son sat beside him, massaging his feet.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3236"></a>Now the Yakkha that haunted the place had received it for twelve years&rsquo; service of Vessavaṇa,<a id="a3237"></a><a href="notes.html#a15014"><span class="t9">{378}</span></a> on these terms: that if any man who entered it should sneeze, and when long life was wished him, should answer, &ldquo;Long life to you!&rdquo; or, &ldquo;The same to you!&rdquo; all except these the Yakkha had a right to eat.<a id="a3238"></a><a href="notes.html#a15016"><span class="t9">{379}</span></a><a id="a3239"></a> The Yakkha lived upon the central rafter of the hut.<a id="a3240"></a><a href="notes.html#a15019"><span class="t9">{380}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">He determined to make the father of the Bodhisatta sneeze. Accordingly, by his magic power he raised a cloud of fine dust, which entered the man&rsquo;s nostrils; and as he lay on the bench, he sneezed. The son did not cry, &ldquo;Long life!&rdquo; and down came the Yakkha from his perch, ready to devour his victim. But the Bodhisatta saw him descend, and then these thoughts passed through his mind. &ldquo;Doubtless it is he who made my father sneeze. This must be a Yakkha that eats all who do not say &lsquo;Long life to you.&rsquo; &rdquo; And addressing his father, he repeated the first verse as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Jīva vassasataṁ Bhagga, aparāni ca vīsatiṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mā maṁ Pisācā khādantu, jīva tvaṁ sarado satan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Live for a hundred years, Bhagga, and for a further twenty years, may no Pisācas eat me up, may you live a hundred seasons.</span></p>
<p class="p23">The Yakkha thought: &ldquo;This one I cannot eat, because he said &lsquo;Long life to you.&rsquo; But I shall eat his father,&rdquo; and he came close to the father. But the man divined the truth of the matter, &ldquo;This must be a Yakkha,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;who eats all who do not reply, &lsquo;Long life to you, too!&rsquo; &rdquo; and so addressing his son, he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Tvam-pi vassasataṁ jīvaṁ, aparāni ca vīsatiṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Visaṁ Pisācā khādantu, jīva tvaṁ sarado satan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">May you live for a hundred years, and for a further twenty years, may the Pisācas eat poison, may you live a hundred seasons. </span><span class="t18">{2.17}</span></p>
<p class="p23">The Yakkha hearing these words, turned away, thinking: &ldquo;Neither of these is for me to eat.&rdquo; But the Bodhisatta put a question to him, &ldquo;Come, Yakkha, how is it you eat the people who enter this building?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I earned the right for twelve years&rsquo; service of Vessavaṇa.&rdquo; &ldquo;What, are you allowed to eat everybody?&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.13] </span>&ldquo;All except those who say &lsquo;The same to you&rsquo; when another wishes them long life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yakkha,&rdquo; said the lad, &ldquo;you have done some wickedness in former lives, which has caused you to be born now fierce, and cruel, and a bane to others. If you do the same kind of thing now, you will pass from darkness to darkness. Therefore from this time forth abstain from such things as taking life.&rdquo; With these words he humbled the Yakkha, scared him with fear of hell, established him in the Five Precepts, and made him as obedient as an errand-boy.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day, when the people came and saw the Yakkha, and learned how that the Bodhisatta had subdued him, they went and told the king, &ldquo;My lord, some man has subdued the Yakkha, and made him as obedient as an errand-boy!&rdquo; So the king sent for him, and raised him to be commander-in-chief; while he heaped honours upon the father. Having made the Yakkha a tax-gatherer, and established him in the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s precepts, after giving alms and doing good he departed to swell the hosts of heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this story, which he told to explain when the custom first arose of answering &lsquo;Long life&rsquo; by &lsquo;The same to you,&rsquo; he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;In those days, Ānanda was the king, Kassapa the father, and I myself was the lad, his son.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Alīna took king Kosala.&rdquo;</span><a id="a3253"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a fainthearted monk. The circumstances will be set forth in the Saṁvarajātaka [Ja 462] in the eleventh Book.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3254"></a><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about a monk who had ceased to strive. This, we learn, was a young man of family, who lived in Sāvatthi. Having heard the Teacher&rsquo;s discoursing, he renounced the world. Fulfilling the tasks imposed by his teachers and preceptors, he learned by heart both the Pātimokkhas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When five years were past, he said: &ldquo;When I have been instructed in the mode of attaining Absorption, I will go dwell in the forest.&rdquo; Then he took leave of his teachers and preceptors, and proceeded to a frontier village in the kingdom of Kosala. The people were pleased with his behaviour, and he made a hut of leaves and there was attended to.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3255"></a><span class="t34">Entering upon the rainy season, zealous, eager, striving in strenuous endeavour he strove after Absorption for the space of three months: but of this not a trace could he produce. Then he thought: &ldquo;Verily I am the most devoted to worldly conditions among the four classes of men taught by the Teacher! What have I to do with living in the forest?&rdquo; Then he said to himself, &ldquo;I will return to Jetavana, and there in beholding the beauty of the Tathāgata, and hearing his discourse sweet as honey, I will pass my days.&rdquo; So he relaxed his striving; and setting forth he came in course of time to Jetavana. His preceptors and teachers, his friends and acquaintances asked him the cause of his coming. He informed them, and they reproved him for it, asking him why he had done so.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then they led him into the Teacher&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Why, monks,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;do you lead a monk here against his will?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;This monk has come here because he has relaxed his striving.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3256"></a><span class="t30">When the Teacher asked this monk if he really were fainthearted, as was said, he replied, </span><span class="t18">{2.18}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Yes, Fortunate One.&rdquo; To which the Teacher said: &ldquo;What, monk! In former days did you not gain supremacy over the kingdom of Benares, twelve leagues either way, and give it to a baby boy, like a lump of flesh and nothing more, and all this just by perseverance! And now that you have embraced this dispensation, are you to lose heart and faint?&rdquo; And he told a story of olden days. </span><span class="t18">[2.14]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3257"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, there was a village of carpenters not far from the city, in which five hundred carpenters lived. They would go up the river in a vessel, and enter the forest, where they would shape beams and planks for housebuilding, and put together the framework of one storey or two storey houses, numbering all the pieces from the mainpost onwards; these then they brought down to the river bank, and put them all aboard; then rowing down stream again, they would build houses to order as it was required of them; after which, when they received their wage, they went back again for more materials for the building, and in this way they made their livelihood.</p>
<p class="p7">Once it befell that in a place where they were at work in shaping timbers, a certain elephant trod upon a splinter of acacia wood, which pierced his foot, and caused it to swell up and fester, and he was in great pain. In his agony, he caught the sound of these carpenters cutting wood. &ldquo;There are some carpenters who will cure me,&rdquo; thought he; and limping on three feet, he presented himself before them, and lay down close by. The carpenters, noticing his swollen foot, went up and looked; there was the splinter sticking in it. With a sharp tool they made incision about the splinter, and tying a string to it, pulled it right out. Then they lanced the gathering, and washed it with warm water, and doctored it properly; and in a very short time the wound was healed.</p>
<p class="p7">Grateful for this cure, the elephant thought: &ldquo;My life has been saved by the help of these carpenters; now I must make myself useful to them.&rdquo; So ever after that, <span class="t18">{2.19}</span> he used to pull up trees for them, or when they were chopping he would roll up the logs; or bring them their adzes and any tools they might want, holding everything in his trunk like grim death. And the carpenters, when it was time to feed him, used to bring him each a portion of food, so that he had five hundred portions in all.</p>
<p class="p7">Now this elephant had a young one, white all over, a magnificent high-bred creature. The elephant reflected that he was now old, and he had better bring his young one to serve the carpenters, and himself be left free to go. So without a word to the carpenters he went off into the wood, and brought his son to them, saying: &ldquo;This young elephant is a son of mine. You saved my life, and I give him to you as a fee for your medical help; from henceforward he shall work for you.&rdquo; So he explained to the young elephant that it was his duty to do the work which he had been used to do himself, and then went away into the forest, leaving him with the carpenters. So after that time the young elephant did all their work, faithfully and obediently; and they fed him, as they had fed the other, with five hundred portions for a meal.</p>
<p class="p7">His work once done, the elephant would go play about in the <span class="t18">[2.15] </span><a id="a3258"></a>river, and then return again. The carpenters&rsquo; children used to pull him by the trunk, and play all sorts of pranks with him in water and out. Now noble creatures, be they elephants, horses, or men, never dung or stale in the water. So this elephant did nothing of the kind when he was in the water, but waited until he came out upon the bank.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, rain had fallen up river; and by the flood a half-dry cake of his dung was carried into the river. This floated down to the Benares landing place, where it stuck fast in a bush. Just then the king&rsquo;s elephant keepers had brought down five hundred elephants to give them a bath. But the creatures scented this soil of a noble animal, and not one would enter the water; up went their tails, and off they all ran. The keepers told this to the elephant trainers; who replied, &ldquo;There must be something in the water, then.&rdquo; So orders were given to cleanse the water; <span class="t18">{2.20}</span> and there in the bushes this lump was seen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the matter is!&rdquo; cried the men. So they brought a jar, and filled it with water; next powdering the stuff into it, they sprinkled the water over the elephants, whose bodies then became sweet. At once they went down into the river and bathed.</p>
<p class="p7">When the trainers made their report to the king, they advised him to secure the elephant for his own use and profit.</p>
<p class="p7">The king accordingly embarked upon a raft, and rowed up stream until he arrived at the place where the carpenters had settled. The young elephant, hearing the sound of drums as he was playing in the water, came out and presented himself before the carpenters, who one and all came forth to do honour to the king&rsquo;s coming, and said to him, &ldquo;Sire, if woodwork is wanted, what need to come here? Why not send and have it brought to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;No, no, good friends,&rdquo; the king answered, &ldquo; &rsquo;tis not for wood that I come, but for this elephant here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;He is yours, sire!&rdquo; But the elephant refused to budge.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I say, what do you want me to do, elephant?&rdquo; asked the king.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Order the carpenters to be paid for what they have spent on me, sire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Willingly, friend.&rdquo; And the king ordered a hundred thousand pieces of money to be laid by his tail, and trunk, and by each of his four feet. But this was not enough for the elephant; go he would not. So to each of the carpenters was given a pair of cloths, and to each of their wives robes to dress in, nor did he omit to give enough whereby his playmates the children should be brought up; then with a last look upon the carpenters, and the women, and the children, he departed in company with the king. <span class="t18">[2.16]</span></p>
<p class="p7">To his capital city the king brought him; and city and stable were decked out with all magnificence. He led the elephant round the city in solemn procession, and thence into his stable, which was fitted up with splendour and pomp. There he solemnly sprinkled the elephant, and appointed him for his own riding; like a comrade he treated him, and gave him half of his kingdom, <span class="t18">{2.21}</span> taking as much care of him as he did of himself. After the coming of this elephant, the king won supremacy over all Jambudīpa.</p>
<p class="p7">In course of time the Bodhisatta was conceived by the queen consort; and when her time was near to be delivered, the king died. Now if the elephant learned news of the king&rsquo;s death, it was sure to break his heart; so he was waited upon as before, and not a word said. But the next neighbour, the king of Kosala, heard of the king&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;Surely the land is at my mercy,&rdquo; thought he; and marched with a mighty host to the city, and beleaguered it. Straight the gates were closed, and a message was sent to the king of Kosala, &ldquo;Our queen is near the time of her delivery; and the astrologers have declared that in seven days she shall bear a son. If she bears a son, we will not yield the kingdom, but on the seventh day we will give you battle. For so long we pray you wait!&rdquo; And to this the king agreed.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3259"></a>In seven days the queen bore a son. On his name-day they called him prince Alīnacitta [Winheart], because, they said, he was born to win the hearts of the people.</p>
<p class="p7">On the very same day that he was born, the townsfolk began to do battle with the king of Kosala. But as they had no leader, little by little the army gave way, great though it was. The courtiers told this news to the queen, adding, &ldquo;Since our army loses ground in this way, we fear defeat. But the state elephant, our king&rsquo;s bosom friend, has never been told that the king is dead, and a son born to him, and that the king of Kosala is here to give us battle. Shall we tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yes, do so,&rdquo; said the queen. So she dressed up her son, and laid him in a fine linen cloth; after which she with all the court came down from the palace and entered the elephant&rsquo;s stable. There she laid the babe at the elephant&rsquo;s feet, <span class="t18">{2.22}</span><a id="a3260"></a> saying: &ldquo;Teacher, your comrade is dead, but we feared to tell it you lest you might break your heart. This is your comrade&rsquo;s son; the king of Kosala has put a siege about the city, and is making war upon your son; the army is losing ground; either kill your son yourself, or else win the kingdom back for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">At once the elephant stroked the child with his trunk, and lifted him upon his own head; then making moan and lamentation he took him down and laid him in his mother&rsquo;s arms, and with the words, &ldquo;I will master the king of Kosala!&rdquo; he went forth hastily.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the courtiers put his armour and caparison upon him, and <span class="t18">[2.17] </span>unlocked the city gate, and escorted him there. The elephant emerging trumpeted, and frightened all the host so that they ran away, and broke up the camp; then seizing the king of Kosala by his topknot, he carried him to the young prince, at whose feet he let him fall. Some rose to kill him, but them the elephant stayed; and he let the captive king go with this advice, &ldquo;Be careful for the future, and be not presumptuous by reason that our prince is young.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">After that, the power over all Jambudīpa fell into the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s own hand, and not a foe was able to rise up against him. The Bodhisatta was consecrated at the age of seven years, as king Alīnacitta; just was his reign, and when he came to life&rsquo;s end he went to swell the hosts of heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, having become perfectly enlightened, he repeated this couple of verses:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Alīnacittaṁ nissāya pahaṭṭhā mahatī camū,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kosalaṁ senāsantuṭṭhaṁ, jīvaggāhaṁ agāhayi.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Great forces, who were pleased, relying on prince Alīnacitta, captured king Kosala alive, who was displeased with his army.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3261"></a><span class="t12">2. Evaṁ nissayasampanno bhikkhu, āraddhavīriyo,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bhāvayaṁ kusalaṁ dhammaṁ, yogakkhemassa pattiyā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pāpuṇe anupubbena, sabbasaṁyojanakkhayan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">So, being endowed with support the monk, with effort established, by cultivating wholesome thoughts, in order to attain safety, gradually arrives at the destruction of all of the fetters. </span><span class="t18">{2.23}</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">And so the Teacher, bringing his teaching to a climax in the deathless and great Nibbāna, went on to declare the Truths, and then identified the Jātaka, after the Truths, this discontented monk became an Arahat, &ldquo;She who now is Mahāmāyā was then the mother; this discontented monk was the elephant who took the kingdom and handed it over to the child; Sāriputta was the father elephant, and I myself was the young prince.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a3267"></a><span class="t15">In the present the king of Kosala gives 1,000 robes to Ven. Ānanda, who then gives 500 to monks in need, and 500 to his attendant monk, who passes them to other novices. The king asks the Buddha if this is proper, and the latter tells a story of how a jackal saved a lion, and the lion thereafter looked after the jackal and his family.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the lion (sīha),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Ānanda = the jackal (sigāla).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;The strong will always have their way.&rdquo;</span><a id="a3270"></a><a id="a3271"></a><span class="t30"> This was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana after elder Ānanda received a present of a thousand robes. The elder had been preaching to the ladies of the king of Kosala&rsquo;s palace as described above in the Mahāsārajātaka [Ja 92].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3272"></a><span class="t34">Once the wives of the king of Kosala thought among themselves, as follows, &ldquo;Very rare is the coming of a Buddha; and very rare is birth in a human form with all one&rsquo;s faculties in perfection. Yet, though we have happened on a human form in a Buddha&rsquo;s lifetime, we cannot go at will to the monastery to hear the truth from his own lips, to do obeisance, and to make offerings to him. We live here as in a box. Let us ask the king to send for a fitting monk to come here and teach us the truth. Let us learn what we can from him, and be charitable and do good works, to the end that we may profit by our having been born at this happy juncture.&rdquo; So they all went in a body to the king, and told him what was in their minds; and the king gave his consent.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now it fell out on a day that the king was minded to take his pleasure in the royal pleasure gardens, and gave orders that the grounds should be made ready for his coming. As the gardener was working away, he espied the Teacher seated at the foot of a tree. So he went to the king and said: &ldquo;The pleasure gardens is made ready, sire; but the Fortunate One is sitting there at the foot of a tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;we will go and hear the Teacher.&rdquo; Mounting his chariot of state, he went to the Teacher in the pleasure gardens.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3273"></a><a id="a3274"></a><span class="t34">Now there was then seated at the Teacher&rsquo;s feet, listening to his teaching, a lay brother named Chattapāṇi [Parasol Holder], who had entered the Third Path. On catching sight of this lay brother, the king hesitated; but, on reflection that this must be a virtuous man, or he would not be sitting by the Teacher for instruction, he approached and with a bow seated himself on one side of the Teacher. Out of reverence for the supreme Buddha, the lay brother neither rose in the king&rsquo;s honour nor saluted his majesty; and this made the king very angry. Noticing the king&rsquo;s displeasure, the Teacher proceeded to extol the merits of that lay brother, saying: &ldquo;Sire, this lay brother is master of all tradition; he knows by heart the discourses that have been handed down; and he has set himself free from the bondage of passion.&rdquo; &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; thought the king, &ldquo;he whose praises the Teacher is telling can be no ordinary person.&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;Let me know, lay brother, if you are in need of anything.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the man. Then the king listened to the Teacher&rsquo;s teaching, and at its close rose up and ceremoniously withdrew.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Another day, meeting that same lay brother going after breakfast umbrella in hand to Jetavana, the king had him summoned to his presence and said: &ldquo;I hear, lay brother, that you are a man of great learning. Now my wives are very anxious to hear and learn the truth; I should be glad if you would teach them.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is not meet, sire, that a layman should expound or teach the truth in the king&rsquo;s harem; that is the prerogative of the monks.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3275"></a><a id="a3276"></a><span class="t34">Recognising the force of this remark, the king, after dismissing the layman, called his wives together and announced to them his intention of sending to the Teacher for one of the monks to come as their instructor in the Dhamma. Which of the eighty chief disciples would they have? After talking it over together, the ladies with one accord chose Ānanda the elder, surnamed the Treasurer of the Dhamma [Dhammabhaṇḍāgārika]. So the king went to the Teacher and with a courteous greeting sat down by his side, after which he proceeded to state his wives&rsquo; wish, and his own hope, that Ānanda might be their teacher. The Teacher, having consented to send Ānanda, the king&rsquo;s wives now began to be regularly taught by the elder and to learn from him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">As he preached there in the manner described, </span><span class="t18">{2.24}</span><span class="t30"> a thousand robes, worth each a thousand pieces of money, were brought to the king. Of these the king </span><span class="t18">[2.18] </span><span class="t30">gave five hundred to as many of his queens. The ladies put these aside and made them a present to our elder, and then the next day in their old ones went to the palace where the king took breakfast. The king remarked, &ldquo;I gave you dresses worth a thousand pieces each. Why are you not wearing them?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we have given them to the elder.&rdquo; &ldquo;Has elder Ānanda got them all?&rdquo; he asked. They said: &ldquo;Yes, he has.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Supreme Buddha,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;allows only three robes. Ānanda is doing a little trade in cloth, I suppose!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">He was angry with the elder; and after breakfast, visited him in his cell, and after greeting, sat down, with these words: &ldquo;Pray, sir, do my ladies learn or listen to your preaching?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Yes, sire; they learn what they ought, and what they ought to hear, they hear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Oh, indeed. Do they only listen, or do they make you presents of upper garments or under-garments?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Today, sire, they have given me five hundred robes worth a thousand pieces each.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;And you accepted them, sir?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Yes, sire, I did.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Why, sir, didn&rsquo;t the Teacher make some rule about three robes?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;True, sire, for every monk three robes is the rule, speaking of what he uses for himself. But no one is forbidden to accept what is offered; and that is why I took them &ndash; to give them to monks whose robes are worn out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;But when these monks get them from you, what do they do with their old ones?&rdquo; &ldquo;Make them into a cloak.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what about the old cloak?&rdquo; &ldquo;That they turn into a shirt.&rdquo; &ldquo;And the old shirt?&rdquo; &ldquo;That serves for a coverlet.&rdquo; &ldquo;The old coverlet?&rdquo; &ldquo;Becomes a mat.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{2.25}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;The old mat?&rdquo; &ldquo;A towel.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what about the old towel?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Sire, it is not permitted to waste the gifts of the faithful; so they chop up the old towel into bits, and mix the bits with clay, which they use for mortar in building their houses.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;A gift, sir, ought not to be destroyed, not even a towel.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Well, sir king, we destroy no gifts, but all are used somehow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This conversation pleased the king so much, that he sent for the other five hundred robes which remained, and gave them to the elder. Then, after receiving his thanks, he greeted the elder in solemn state, and went his way.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3277"></a><a id="a3278"></a><span class="t30">The elder gave the first five hundred robes to monks whose robes were worn out. But the number of his fellow monastics was just five hundred. One of these, a young monk, was very useful to the elder; sweeping out his cell, serving him with food and drink, giving him toothbrush and water for cleansing his mouth, looking after the privies, living rooms, and sleeping rooms, and doing all that was needed for hand, foot, or back. To him, as his by right for all his great service, the elder gave all the five hundred robes which he had received afterwards. The young monk in his turn distributed them among his fellow-students. These all cut them up, dyed them yellow as a kaṇikāra</span><a id="a3279"></a><a href="notes.html#a15021"><span class="t9">{381}</span></a><span class="t30"> flower; then dressed therein they waited upon the Teacher, greeted him, and sat down on one side.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they asked, &ldquo;is it possible for a holy disciple who has entered on the First Path to be a respecter of persons in his gifts?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, monks, it is not possible for holy disciples to be respecters of persons in their gifts.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, our spiritual teacher, the Treasurer of the Dhamma, gave five hundred robes, each worth a thousand pieces, to a young monk; and he has divided them amongst us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monks, in giving these Ānanda was no respecter of persons. </span><span class="t18">{2.26}</span><a id="a3280"></a><span class="t30"> That young fellow was a very useful servant; so he made the present to his own attendant for the sake of his service, for the sake of his goodness, </span><span class="t18">[2.19] </span><span class="t30">and by right, thinking that one good turn deserves another, and with a wish to do what gratitude demands. In former days, as now, wise men acted on the principle one good turn deserves another.&rdquo; And then, at their request, he told them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was a lion living in a cave on the hills. One day he came out from his lair and looked towards the mountain foot. Now all round the foot of that mountain stretched a great piece of water. Upon some ground that rose out of this was a quantity of soft green grass, growing on the thick mud, and over this mud ran rabbits and deer and such light creatures, eating of the grass. On that day, as usual, there was a deer eating grass upon it.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that deer!&rdquo; thought the lion; and with a lion&rsquo;s leap he sprang from the hillside towards it. But the deer, frightened to death, scampered away bellowing. The lion could not stop his onset; down on the mud he fell, and sank in, so that he could not get out; and there he remained seven days, his feet fixed like four posts, with not a morsel to eat.</p>
<p class="p7">Then a jackal, hunting for food, chanced to see him; and set off running in high terror. But the lion called out to him, &ldquo;I say, jackal, don&rsquo;t run &ndash; here am I, caught fast in the mud. Please save me!&rdquo; Up came the jackal. &ldquo;I could pull you out,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but I much fear that once out you might eat me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fear nothing, I won&rsquo;t eat you,&rdquo; says the lion. &ldquo;On the contrary, I&rsquo;ll do you great service; only get me out somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The jackal, accepting this promise, worked away the mud around his four feet, and the holes wherein his four feet were fixed he dug further towards the water; <span class="t18">{2.27}</span> then the water ran in, and made the mud soft. Then he got underneath the lion, saying: &ldquo;Now, sir, one great effort,&rdquo; making a loud noise and striking the lion&rsquo;s belly with his head. The lion strained every nerve, and scrambled out of the mud; he stood on dry land. After a moment&rsquo;s rest, he plunged in the lake, and washed and scoured the mud from him.</p>
<p class="p7">Then he killed a buffalo, and with his fangs tore up its flesh, of which he proffered some to the jackal, saying: &ldquo;Eat, comrade!&rdquo; and himself after the jackal had done did eat too. After this, the jackal took a piece in his mouth. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; the lion asked. &ldquo;For your humble servant my mate, who awaits me at home.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; says the lion, taking a bit for his own mate. &ldquo;Come, comrade,&rdquo; says he again, &ldquo;let us stay awhile on the mountain top, and then go to the lady&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; So there they went, and the lion fed the female jackal; and after they were both satisfied, he said: &ldquo;Now I am going <span class="t18">[2.20] </span>to take care of you.&rdquo; So he conducted them to the place where he dwelt, and settled them in a cave near to the entrance of his own.</p>
<p class="p7">Ever after that, he and the jackal used to go hunting together, leaving their mates behind; all kinds of creatures they would kill, and eat to their hearts&rsquo; content, and then bring back some for the two others.</p>
<p class="p7">And as time went on, the female jackal and the lioness had each two cubs, and they all lived happily together.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, a sudden thought struck the lioness. &ldquo;My lion seems very fond of the jackal and his mate and young ones. What if there be something wrong between them! That must be the cause why he is so fond of them, I suppose. Well, I will plague her and frighten her, and chase her away from this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So when the lion and the jackal were away on the hunt, she plagued and terrified the jackal&rsquo;s mate, asking her why she stayed there, <span class="t18">{2.28}</span> why she did not run away? And her cubs frightened the young jackals after the same fashion. The female jackal told her mate what had been said. &ldquo;It is clear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that the lion must have dropped a hint about us. We have been here a long time; and now he will be the death of us. Let us go back to the place where we lived before!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">On hearing this, the jackal approached the lion, with these words. &ldquo;Teacher, we have been here a long time. Those who stay too long outstay their welcome. While we are away, your lioness scolds and terrifies my mate, by asking why she stays, and telling her to begone; your young ones do the same to mine. If any one does not like a neighbour, he should just bid him go, and send him about his business; what is the use of all this plaguing?&rdquo; So saying, he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Yena kāmaṁ paṇāmeti dhammo balavataṁ, migī.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unnadantī vijānāhi: jātaṁ saraṇato bhayan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">The nature of one strong is he dismisses whatever he likes, beast. Unnadantī, know you this: fear has arisen from our refuge. </span><span class="t18">{2.29}</span></p>
<p class="p23">The lion listened; then turning to his lioness, &ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you remember how once I was out hunting for a week, and then brought back this jackal and his mate with me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I remember.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, do you know why I stayed away all that week?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;My wife, in trying to catch a deer, I made a mistake, and stuck fast in the mud; there I stayed &ndash; for I could not get out &ndash; a whole week without food. My life was saved by this jackal. This my friend saved my life! A friend in need is a friend indeed, be he great or small. Never again must you put a slight upon my comrade, or his wife, or his family.&rdquo; And then the lion repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Api ce pi dubbalo mitto, mittadhammesu tiṭṭhati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So ñātako ca bandhu ca, so mitto so ca me sakhā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dāṭhini mātimaññittho, siṅgālo mama pāṇado ti!</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Although he is a weak friend, he is established in friendliness, he is my relative and kin, that friend is a comrade to me, O sharp-fanged one, do not despise him, that jackal preserved my life! </span><span class="t18">[2.21]</span></p>
<p class="p23">The lioness, when she heard this tale, made her peace with the jackal&rsquo;s mate, and ever after lived at amity with her and her young ones. And the young of the two pairs played together in their early days, and when the parents died, <span class="t18">{2.30}</span> they did not break the bond of friendship, but lived happily together as the old ones had lived before them.

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Birds of a feather.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while at Jetavana, about two hot-tempered monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3289"></a><span class="t30">It happened that there were two monks, passionate, cruel, and violent, one living at Jetavana and one in the country. Once the country monk came to Jetavana on some errand or other. The novices and young monks knew the passionate nature of this man, so they led him to the cell of the other, all agog to see them quarrel. No sooner did they spy one another, those two hot-tempered men, than they ran into each other&rsquo;s arms, stroking and caressing hands, and feet, and back!</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks talked about it in the Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;Friend, these passionate monks are cross, cruel, angry to everybody else, but with each other they are the best of friends, cordial and sympathetic!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, asking what they sat there talking about? They told him. Said he, &ldquo;This, monks, is not the only time that these men, who are cross, cruel, and angry to all else, have shown themselves cordial, and friendly, and sympathetic to each other. It happened just so in olden days,&rdquo; and so saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was his do-all, a courtier who advised him on things temporal and things spiritual. Now this king was of a somewhat covetous nature; <span class="t18">{2.31}</span><a id="a3290"></a> and he had a brute of a horse, named Mahāsoṇa, or Big Chestnut. <span class="t18">[2.22]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Some horse-dealers from the north country brought down five hundred horses; and word was sent to the king that these horses had arrived. Now heretofore the Bodhisatta had always asked the dealers to fix their own price, and then paid it in full. But now the king, being displeased with him, summoned another of his court, to whom he said,</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Friend, make the men name their price; then let loose Big Chestnut so that he goes amongst them; make him bite them, and when they are weak and wounded get the men to reduce their price.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the man; and so he did.</p>
<p class="p7">The dealers in great dudgeon told the Bodhisatta what this horse had done.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3291"></a>&ldquo;Have you not such another brute in your own city?&rdquo; asked the Bodhisatta. Yes, they said, there was one named Suhanu [Strongjaw], and a fierce and savage brute he was. &ldquo;Bring him with you the next time you come,&rdquo; the Bodhisatta said; and this they promised to do.</p>
<p class="p7">So the next time they came this brute came with them. The king, on hearing how the horse-dealers had arrived, opened his window to look at the horses, and caused Chestnut to be let loose. Then as the dealers saw Chestnut coming, they let Strongjaw loose. No sooner had the two met, than they stood still licking each other all over!</p>
<p class="p7">The king asked the Bodhisatta how it was. &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when these two rogue horses come across others, they are fierce, wild, and savage, they bite them, and make them ill. But with each other &ndash; there they stand, licking one another all over the body! What&rsquo;s the reason of this?&rdquo; &ldquo;The reason is,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;that they are not dissimilar, but like in nature and character.&rdquo; And he repeated this couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Na-y-idaṁ visamasīlena Soṇena Suhanū saha,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Suhanū pi tādiso yeva, yo Soṇassa sagocaro.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Suhanu does not have bad behaviour with Soṇa in this place, Suhanu is of such a kind, and Soṇa his companion.</span><span class="t18">{2.32}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Pakkhandinā pagabbhena niccaṁ sandānakhādinā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sameti pāpaṁ pāpena, sameti asatā asan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">The transgressor and the arrogant always bite on the tether, the wicked agree with the wicked, the bad agree with the bad.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Then the Bodhisatta went on to warn the king against excessive covetise, and the spoiling of other men&rsquo;s goods; and fixing the value, he made him pay the proper price. The dealers received the due value, and went away well satisfied; and the king, abiding by the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s admonition, at last passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The bad monks were then these two horses, Ānanda was the king, and I was the wise counsellor.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk falls away from the spiritual life after seeing a woman in fine dress.

Even wise men, who for seven hundred years have done no wrong, on hearing a woman&rsquo;s voice have transgressed in a moment; even the holy become impure; even they who have attained the highest honour have thus come to disgrace &ndash; how much more the unholy!&rdquo; and he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta came into this world as a peacock. The egg which contained him had a shell as yellow as a kaṇikāra bud; and when he broke the shell, he became a golden peacock, fair and lovely, with beautiful red lines under his wings. To preserve his life, he traversed three ranges of hills, and in the fourth he settled, on a plateau of a golden hill in Daṇḍaka. When day dawned, as he sat upon the hill, watching the sun rise, he composed a Brahmā spell to preserve himself safe in his own feeding-ground, the charm beginning, &ldquo;There he rises,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3299"></a><a id="a3300"></a><span class="t12">1. Udetayaṁ cakkhumā ekarājā,</span></p>

<p class="p23">Worshipping the sun on this wise by the verse here recited, he repeats another in worship of the Buddhas who have passed away, and all their virtues:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Ye brāhmaṇā vedagū sabbadhamme</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Te me namo, te ca maṁ pālayantu!</span></p>

<p class="p23">So after flying about all day, he came back at even and sat on the hilltop to see the sun go down; then as he meditated, he uttered another spell to preserve himself and keep off evil, the one beginning, &ldquo;There he sets,&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p23">Now there was a hunter who lived in a certain village of wild huntsmen, near Benares. Wandering about among the Himālayas hills he noticed the Bodhisatta perched upon the golden hill of Daṇḍaka, and told it to his son.</p>
<p class="p7">It so befell that on a day one of the wives of the king of Benares, Khemā by name, saw in a dream a golden peacock holding a Dhamma discourse. This she told to the king, saying that she longed to hear the discourse of the golden peacock. The king asked his courtiers about it; and the courtiers said: &ldquo;The brahmins will be sure to know.&rdquo; The brahmins said: &ldquo;Yes, there are golden peacocks.&rdquo; When asked, where? They replied, &ldquo;The hunters will be sure to know.&rdquo; The king called the hunters together and asked them. Then this hunter answered, &ldquo;O lord king, there is a golden hill in Daṇḍaka; and there a golden peacock lives.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then bring it here &ndash; kill it not, but just take it alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The hunter set snares in the peacock&rsquo;s feeding-ground. But even when the peacock stepped upon it, the snare would not close. This the hunter tried for seven years, but catch him he could not; and there he died. And queen Khemā too died without obtaining her wish.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3303"></a>The king was angry because his queen had died for the sake of a peacock. He caused an inscription to be made upon a golden plate to this effect, &ldquo;Among the Himālayas mountains is a golden hill in Daṇḍaka. There lives a golden peacock; and whoso eats of its flesh becomes ever young and immortal.&rdquo; This he enclosed in a casket.</p>
<p class="p7">After his death, the next king read this inscription: and he thought: &ldquo;I will become ever young and immortal,&rdquo; so he sent another <span class="t18">[2.25] </span>hunter. Like the first, this hunter failed to capture the peacock, and died in the quest. In the same way the kingdom was ruled by six successive kings.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3304"></a>Then a seventh arose, who also sent forth a hunter. The hunter observed that when the golden peacock came into the snare, it did not shut to, <span class="t18">{2.37}</span><a id="a3305"></a> and also that he recited a charm before setting out in search of food. Off he went to the marches, and caught a peahen, which he trained to dance when he clapped his hands, and at snap of finger to utter her cry. Then, taking her along with him, he set the snare, fixing its uprights in the ground, early in the morning, before the peacock had recited his charm. Then he made the peahen utter a cry. This unwonted sound &ndash; the female&rsquo;s note &ndash; woke desire in the peacock&rsquo;s breast; leaving his charm unsaid, he came towards her; and was caught in the net. Then the hunter took hold of him and conveyed him to the king of Benares.</p>
<p class="p7">The king was delighted at the peacock&rsquo;s beauty; and ordered a seat to be placed for him. Sitting on the proffered seat, the Bodhisatta asked, &ldquo;Why did you have me caught, O king?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Because they say all that eat of you become immortal and have eternal youth. So I wish to gain youth eternal and immortality by eating of you,&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;So be it &ndash; granted that all who eat of me become immortal and have eternal youth. But that means that I must die!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Of course it does,&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well &ndash; and if I die, how can my flesh give immortality to those that eat of it?</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3306"></a>&ldquo;Your colour is golden; therefore (so it is said) those who eat your flesh become young and live so for ever.&rdquo;<a id="a3307"></a><a href="notes.html#a15023"><span class="t9">{382}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the bird, &ldquo;there is a very good reason for my golden colour. Long ago, I held imperial sway over the whole world, reigning in this very city; I kept the Five Precepts, and made all people of the world keep the same. For that I was born again after death in the World of the Thirty-Three; there I lived out my life, but in my next birth I became a peacock in consequence of some wrong; however, golden I became because I had previously kept the Precepts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What? Incredible! You an imperial ruler, who kept the Precepts! Born gold-coloured as the fruit of them! A proof, pray you!&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.26] {2.38} </span>&ldquo;I have one, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, sire, when I was monarch, I used to pass through mid-air seated in a jewelled carriage, which now lies buried in the earth beneath the waters of the royal lake. Dig it up from beneath the lake, and that shall be my proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king approved the plan; he caused the lake to be drained, and dug out the chariot, and believed the Bodhisatta. Then the Bodhisatta addressed him thus:</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sire, except Nibbāna, which is everlasting, all things else, being composite in their nature, are unsubstantial, transient, and subject to living and death.&rdquo; Discoursing on this theme he established the king in keeping of the Precepts. Peace filled the king&rsquo;s heart; he bestowed his kingdom upon the Bodhisatta, and showed him the highest respect. The Bodhisatta returned the gift; and after a few days&rsquo; sojourn, he rose up in the air, and flew back to the golden hill of Daṇḍaka, with a parting word of advice, &ldquo;O king, be careful!&rdquo; And the king on his part clave to the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s advice; and after giving alms and doing good, passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This discourse ended, the Teacher declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, now after the Truths the discontented monk became a Saint, &ldquo;Ānanda was the king of those days, and I myself was the golden peacock.&rdquo;</span></p>

On arriving at Veḷuvana, the Teacher asked them what Devadatta had done when he saw them? </span><span class="t18">{2.39}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;he </span><span class="t18">[2.27] </span><span class="t30">imitated the Buddha, and was utterly destroyed.&rdquo; The Teacher answered, &ldquo;It is not only now, Sāriputta, that Devadatta came to dire destruction by mimicking me; it was just the same before.&rdquo; Then at the elder&rsquo;s request, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Videha was reigning at Mithilā in the realm of Videha, the Bodhisatta became a son of his queen consort. He grew up in due course, and was educated at Taxila; and on his father&rsquo;s decease he inherited his kingdom.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3319"></a>At that time a certain king of the golden geese paired with a crow at the feeding-grounds, and to them was born a son. He was like neither mother nor father. All dingy blue-black he was, and accordingly they gave him Vinīlaka [Dingy] to his name. The goose-king often visited his offspring; and he had besides two other sons, geese like himself. These remarked that he often used to go to the regions where mankind do frequent, and asked him what should be the reason. &ldquo;My sons,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have a mate there, a crow, and she has given me a son, whose name is Vinīlaka. He it is I go to visit.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where do they live?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;On a palm-top near Mithilā in the kingdom of Videha,&rdquo; describing the spot. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;where men are, there is fear and peril. You ought not to go there; let us go and fetch him to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So they took a stick, and perched Vinīlaka upon it; then catching the ends in their beaks, they flew over the city of Mithilā.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3320"></a>At that moment king Videha chanced to be sitting in a magnificent carriage drawn by a team of four milk-white thoroughbreds, as he made a triumphal circuit of the city. Vinīlaka saw him, and thought he, &ldquo;What is the difference between king Videha and me? He is riding in state around his capital in a chariot drawn by four white horses; and I am carried in a vehicle drawn by a pair of geese.&rdquo; So as he passed through the air he repeated the first verse: <span class="t18">{2.40}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Evam-eva nūna rājānaṁ Vedehaṁ Mithilaggahaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Assā vahanti ājaññā, yathā haṁsā Vinīlakan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">So, what if the king of Videha, of the house of Mithilā, is carried on his thoroughbred horses, so Vinīlaka is carried on geese.</span></p>
<p class="p23">These words made the geese angry. Their first thought was, &ldquo;Let us drop him here, and leave him!&rdquo; But then again they bethought them, &ldquo;What will our father say!&rdquo; So for fear of rebuke, they brought the creature to their father, and recounted all that he had done. The father grew angry when he heard it, &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are you my sons&rsquo; superior, that you make yourself master over them, and treat them like horses in a carriage? You don&rsquo;t know your measure. This is no place for you; get you back to your mother!&rdquo; And with this censure he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Vinīla duggaṁ bhajasi, abhūmiṁ tāta sevasi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gāmantakāni sevassu, etaṁ mātālayaṁ tavā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Vinīla, you came to a pass, no place, my dear, for you to come, you should go to the edges of the village, that&rsquo;s your mother&rsquo;s nest. </span><span class="t18">[2.28]</span></p>
<p class="p23">With this censure, he bade his sons convey the bird to the dunghill outside the city of Mithilā; and so they did.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Devadatta in those days was Vinīlaka, the two elders were the two young geese, Ānanda was the father goose, and I was king Videha myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
