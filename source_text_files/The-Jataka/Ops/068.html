<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk, though taught the way of a monastic, refuses to listen, and wants to live according to his own ideas. The Buddha tells how he was once a vulture who didn&rsquo;t listen to his elders and was destroyed by his disobedience.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Formed of rough logs.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [3.287] {3.483}</span><a id="a9887"></a><a id="a9888"></a><a id="a9889"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana concerning a disobedient monk. He was, they say, of gentle birth, and though ordained in the dispensation that leads to safety, was admonished by his well-wishers, masters, teachers, and fellow-students to this effect, &ldquo;Thus must you advance and thus retreat; thus look at or away from objects; thus must the arm be stretched out or drawn back; thus are the inner and outer garment to be worn; thus is the bowl to be held, and when you have received sufficient food to sustain life, after self-examination, thus are you to partake of it, keeping guard over the door of the senses; in eating you are to be moderate and exercise watchfulness; you are to recognize such and such duties towards monks who come to or go from the monastery; these are the fourteen</span><a id="a9890"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15707"><span class="t9">{701}</span></a><a id="a9891"></a><span class="t30"> sets of monastic duties, and the eighty great duties to be duly performed; these are the thirteen ascetic practices; all these are to be scrupulously performed.&rdquo; Yet was he disobedient and impatient, and did not receive instruction respectfully, but refused to listen to them, saying: &ldquo;I do not find fault with you. Why do you speak thus to me? I shall know what is for my good, and what is not.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the monks, hearing of his disobedience, sat in the Dhamma Hall, telling of his faults. The Teacher came and asked them what it was they were discussing, and sent for the monk and said: &ldquo;Is it true, monk, that you are disobedient?&rdquo; And when he confessed that it was so, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Why, monk, after being ordained in so excellent a dispensation that leads to safety, </span><span class="t18">{3.484}</span><span class="t30"> do you not listen to the voice of your well-wishers? Formerly too you disobeyed the voice of the wise, and were blown into atoms by the Veramba wind.&rdquo; And herewith he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past the Bodhisatta came to life as a young vulture on Vulture Mountain [Gijjhapabbata]. Now his offspring Supatta, the king of the vultures, <span class="t18">[3.288] </span>was strong and lusty and had a following of many thousands of vultures, and he fed the parent birds. And owing to his strength he used to fly to a very great distance. So his father admonished him and said: &ldquo;My son, you must not go beyond such and such a point.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; but one day when it rained, he flew up with the other vultures, and leaving the rest behind, and going beyond the prescribed limit, he came within the range of the Veramba wind, and was blown into atoms.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, after Fully Awakening, to illustrate this incident, uttered these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9892"></a><a id="a9893"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Formed of rough logs, an ancient pathway led</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To dizzy heights, where a young vulture fed</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. The parent birds. Lusty and strong of wing</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He oft to them would fat of serpents bring;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. And when his father saw him flying high</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And venturing far afield, he thus would cry,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &lsquo;My son, when you can scan from your lookout</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Earth&rsquo;s rounded sphere by ocean girt about,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No farther go, but straight return, I pray.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. Then would this king of birds speed on his way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And bending o&rsquo;er the earth, with piercing sight</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He viewed below forest and mountain height:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. And earth would, as his sire described, appear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Amid the encircling sea a rounded sphere.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But when beyond these limits he had passed,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Strong bird though he might be, a raging blast</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Swept him away to an untimely death,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Powerless to cope with storm-wind&rsquo;s fiery breath. </span><span class="t18">{3.485}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. Thus did the bird by disobedience prove</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fatal to those dependent on his love:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. So perish all that, scornful of old age,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Deride the warnings uttered by the sage,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As the young vulture wisdom&rsquo;s voice defied</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And scorned the limits set to bound his pride.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.486}</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;Therefore, monk, be not like unto this vulture, but do the bidding of your well-wishers.&rdquo; And being thus admonished by the Teacher, he thenceforth became obedient.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The disobedient vulture of those days is now the disobedient monk. The parent vulture was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present two sets of monks fall into a dispute over a disciplinary matter, and although rebuked by the Buddha continue with it. The Buddha tells a story of a prince who forgave his father&rsquo;s killer, and then admonishes the monks to behave at least as well as their royal predecessor.</span><a id="a9901"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15709"><span class="t16">{702}</span></a></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Whene&rsquo;er the Saṅgha.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><a id="a9905"></a><span class="t18">[3.289] </span><a id="a9906"></a><span class="t30">This story the Teacher, while dwelling in the Ghosita park near Kosambī, told concerning certain quarrelsome folk at Kosambī. The incident that led to the story is to be found in The Section with the Vinaya relating to Kosambī.</span><a id="a9907"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15711"><span class="t9">{703}</span></a><a id="a9908"></a><a id="a9909"></a><span class="t30"> Here is a short summary of it. At that time, it is said, two monks lived in the same house, the one versed in the Vinaya, the other in the Suttas. The latter of these one day having occasion to visit the lavatory went out leaving the surplus water for rinsing the mouth in a vessel. Afterwards the one versed in the Vinaya went in and seeing the water came out and asked his companion if the water had been left there by him. He answered, &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;What! Do you not know that this is wrong?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I was not aware of it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, monk, it is wrong.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I will atone for it.&rdquo; &ldquo;But if you did it inadvertently and heedlessly, it is not wrong.&rdquo; So he became as one who saw no wrong in what was wrongful.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9910"></a><span class="t30">The Vinaya scholar said to his pupils, &ldquo;This Sutta scholar, though falling into wrong, is not aware of it.&rdquo; They on seeing the other monk&rsquo;s pupils said: &ldquo;Your master though falling into wrong does not recognize its wrongfulness.&rdquo; They went and told their master. He said: &ldquo;This Vinaya scholar before said it was no wrong, and now he says it is wrong: he speaks falsely.&rdquo; They went and told the others, &ldquo;Your master speaks falsely.&rdquo; Thus they stirred up a quarrel, one with another. Then the Vinaya scholar, finding an opportunity, went through the form of suspension of the monk for refusing to see his offence. Thenceforth even the laymen who provided necessaries for the monks were divided into two factions. The nuns too that accept their admonitions, and tutelary gods, with their friends and intimates and deities from those that rest in space</span><a id="a9911"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15713"><span class="t9">{704}</span></a><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{3.487}</span><span class="t30"> to those of the Brahmā World, even all such as were unconverted, formed two parties, and the uproar reached to the abode of the Akaniṭṭha gods.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then a certain monk drew near to the Tathāgata, and announced the view of the suspending side who said: &ldquo;The man is legally suspended,&rdquo; and the view of the followers of the suspended one, who said: &ldquo;He is illegally suspended,&rdquo; and the practice of those who though forbidden by the suspending side, still gathered round in support of him. The Fortunate One said: &ldquo;There is a schism, yes, a schism in the Saṅgha,&rdquo; and he went to them and pointed out the misery involved in suspension to those that suspended, and the misery following upon the concealment of the wrong to the opposite party, and so departed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9912"></a><span class="t30">Again when they were holding the Uposatha and similar services in the same place, within the boundary, and were quarrelling in the refectory and elsewhere, he laid down the rule that they were to sit down together, one by one from each side alternately. And hearing that they were still quarrelling in the monastery he went there and said: &ldquo;Enough, monks, let us have no quarrelling.&rdquo; And one of the heretical side,</span><a id="a9913"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15715"><span class="t9">{705}</span></a><span class="t30"> not wishing to annoy the Fortunate One, said: &ldquo;Let the Fortunate One, the master of the Dhamma, dwell quietly at ease, enjoying the bliss he has already obtained in this life. We shall make ourselves notorious by this quarrelling, altercation, disputing and contention.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.290]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9914"></a>But the Teacher said to them, &ldquo;In the past, monks, Brahmadatta reigned as king of Kāsi in Benares, and he robbed Dīghati,<a id="a9915"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15717"><span class="t9">{706}</span></a><a id="a9916"></a> king of Kosala, of his kingdom, and put him to death, when living in disguise, and when prince Dīghāvu spared the life of Brahmadatta, they became thenceforth close friends.<a id="a9917"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15720"><span class="t9">{707}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Since such must have been the long-suffering and tenderness of these sceptred and sword-bearing kings, verily, monks, you ought to make it clear that you too, having embraced the ascetic life according to so well-taught a Dhamma and Discipline, can be forgiving and tender-hearted.&rdquo; And thus admonishing them for the third time he said: &ldquo;Enough, monks, let there be no quarrelling.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When he saw that they did not cease at his bidding, he went away, saying: &ldquo;Verily, these foolish folk are like men possessed, they are not easy of persuasion.&rdquo; Next day returning from the collection of alms he rested awhile in his perfumed chamber, and put his room in order, and then taking his bowl and robe he stood poised in the air and delivered these verses in the midst of the assembly: </span><span class="t18">{3.488}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9918"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Whenever the Saṅgha in twain is rent,</span><a id="a9919"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15722"><span class="t19">{708}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The common folk to loud-mouthed cries give vent:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Each one believes that he himself is wise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And views his neighbour with disdainful eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Bewildered souls, puffed up with self-esteem,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With open mouth they foolishly blaspheme;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And as through all the range of speech they stray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They know not whom as leader to obey.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9920"></a><span class="t12">3. This</span><a id="a9921"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15724"><span class="t19">{709}</span></a><span class="t12"> man abused me, that struck me a blow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A third o&rsquo;ercame and robbed me long ago.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All such as harbour feelings of this kind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To mitigate their wrath are ne&rsquo;er inclined.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. He did abuse and buffet me of yore</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He overcame me and oppressed me sore.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They who such thoughts refuse to entertain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Appease their wrath and live at one again.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. Not hate, but love alone makes hate to cease:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This is the everlasting law of peace.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Some men the law of self-restraint despise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But who make up their quarrels, they are wise.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. If men all scarred with wounds in deadly strife,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Robbers of cattle, taking human life,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nay those that plunder a whole realm, may be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Friends with their foes, should monks not agree?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. Should you</span><a id="a9922"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15726"><span class="t19">{710}</span></a><span class="t12"> a wise and honest comrade find,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A kindred soul, to dwell with you inclined,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All dangers past, with him you still would stray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In happy contemplation all the day.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. But should you fail to meet with such a friend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your life &rsquo;twere best in solitude to spend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like to some prince that abdicates a throne,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or elephant that ranges all alone.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. For choice adopt the solitary life,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Companionship with fools but leads to strife;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In careless innocence pursue your way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like elephant in forest wild astray.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.489}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had thus spoken, as he failed to reconcile these monks, he went to Bālakaloṇakāragāma (the village of Bālaka, the salt-maker), </span><span class="t18">[3.291] </span><span class="t30">and discoursed to the venerable Bhagu of the blessings of solitude. Thence he repaired to the abode of three youths of gentle birth and spoke to them of the bliss to be found in the sweets of concord. Thence he journeyed to the Pārileyyaka forest, </span><span class="t18">{3.490}</span><span class="t30"> and after dwelling there three months, without returning to Kosambī, he went straight to Sāvatthi. And the lay folk of Kosambī consulted together and said: &ldquo;Surely these venerable monks of Kosambī have done us much harm; worried by them the Fortunate One is gone away. We will neither offer salutation nor other marks of respect to them, nor give alms to them when they visit us. So they will depart, or return to the world, or will propitiate the Fortunate One.&rdquo; And they did so. And these monks overwhelmed by this form of punishment went to Sāvatthi and begged forgiveness of the Fortunate One.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9923"></a><span class="t30">The Teacher thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The father was the great king Suddhodana, the mother was Mahāmāyā,</span><a id="a9924"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15728"><span class="t9">{711}</span></a><span class="t30"> prince Dīghāvu was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Wherever fruitful trees.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher dwelling at Jetavana told concerning a certain monk. The story goes that he lived in a forest near a border village in the Kosala country, and received instruction in forms of meditation from the Teacher. The people made him a dwelling-place on a site where men continually passed to and fro, providing him with day and night quarters, and attentively ministered to him. In the very first month after he had entered upon the rainy season the village was burned down and the people had not so much as a seed left and were unable to supply his alms-bowl with savoury food; and though he was in a pleasant place of abode, he was so distressed for alms that he could not enter upon the Path or its Fruition. So when at the end of three months he went to visit the Teacher, after words of kindly greeting the Teacher hoped that though distressed for alms he had a pleasant place to live in. The monk told him how matters stood. The Teacher on hearing that he had pleasant quarters said: &ldquo;Monk, if this is so, an ascetic ought to lay aside covetous ways, and be content to eat whatever food he can get, and to fulfil all the duties of a monastic. Sages of old when born into the world as animals, </span><span class="t18">{3.491}</span><span class="t30"> though they lived on the powdered dust of the decayed </span><span class="t18">[3.292] </span><span class="t30">tree in which they had their abode, laid aside greedy desires and were contented to stay where they were, and fulfilled the law of love. Why then do you abandon a pleasant dwelling-place, because the food you receive is scanty and coarse?&rdquo; And at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9937"></a>In the past many myriads of parrots lived in the Himālayas on the banks of the Ganges in a grove of fig trees. A king of the parrots there, when the fruit of the tree in which he dwelt had come to an end, ate whatever was left, whether shoot or leaf or bark or rind, and drank of water from the Ganges, and being very happy and contented he kept where he was. Owing to his happy and contented state the abode of Sakka was shaken. Sakka reflecting on the cause saw the parrot, and to test his virtue, by his supernatural power he withered up the tree, which became a mere stump perforated with holes, and stood to be buffeted by every blast of wind, and from the holes dust came out. The parrot king ate this dust and drank the water of the Ganges, and going nowhere else sat perched on the top of the fig-stump, thinking nothing of wind and sun.</p>
<p class="p7">Sakka noticed how very contented the parrot was, and said: &ldquo;After hearing him speak of the virtue of friendship, I will come and give him his choice of a boon, and cause the fig tree to bear ambrosial fruit.&rdquo; So he took the form of a royal goose, and preceded by Sujā in the shape of an Asura maiden, he went to the grove of fig trees, and perching on the bough of a tree close by, he entered into conversation with the parrot and spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Wherever fruitful trees abound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A flock of hungry birds is found:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But should the trees all withered be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Away at once the birds will flee.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.492}</span></p>
<p class="p6">And after these words, to drive the parrot thence, he spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Haste you, sir redbeak, to be gone;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why do you sit and dream alone?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come tell me, pray you, bird of spring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To this dead stump why do you cling?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the parrot said: &ldquo;O goose, from a feeling of gratitude, I forsake not this tree,&rdquo; and he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;They who have been close friends from youth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mindful of goodness and of truth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In life and death, in weal and woe</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The claims of friendship ne&rsquo;er forego.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. I too would fain be kind and good</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To one that long my friend has stood;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I wish to live, but have no heart</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From this old tree, though dead, to part.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.293]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka on hearing what he said was delighted, and praising him wished to offer him a choice, and uttered two verses: <span class="t18">{3.493}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;I know your friendship and your grateful love,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Virtues that wise men surely must approve.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. I offer you whate&rsquo;er you will for choice;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Parrot, what boon would most your heart rejoice?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, the king parrot making his choice spoke the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;If you, O goose, what most I crave would give,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Grant that the tree I love, again may live.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let it once more with its old vigour shoot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gather fresh sweetness and bear goodly fruit.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka, granting the boon, spoke the eighth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Lo! Friend, a fruitful and right noble tree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Well fitted for your dwelling-place to be.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let it once more with its old vigour shoot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gather fresh sweetness and bear goodly fruit.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.494}</span></p>
<p class="p6">With these words Sakka quit his present form, and manifesting the supernatural power of himself and Sujā, he took up water from the Ganges in his hand and dashed it against the fig tree stump. Straightaway the tree rose up rich in branch, and stem, and with honey-sweet fruit, and stood a charming sight, like unto the bare Jewel-Mount. The parrot king on seeing it was highly pleased, and singing the praises of Sakka he spoke the ninth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9938"></a><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;May Sakka and all loved by Sakka blesséd be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As I today am blessed this goodly sight to see!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka, after granting the parrot his choice, and causing the fig tree to bear ambrosial fruit, returned with Sujātā to his own abode.</p>
<p class="p7">In illustration of this story these verses spoken after Fully Awakening were added at the close:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Soon as king parrot wisely made his choice,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The tree once more put forth its fruit again;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then Sakka with his queen did fly amain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To where in Nandana the gods rejoice.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, said: &ldquo;Thus, monk, sages of old though born in animal forms were free from covetousness. Why then do you, after being ordained under so excellent a dispensation, follow greedy ways? Go and dwell in the same place.&rdquo; And he gave him a form of meditation, and the monk went back and by spiritual insight became an Arahat. He thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Sakka was Anuruddha, and the parrot king was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher after passing the rainy season at Verañjā in due course arrived at Sāvatthi, the monks in the Dhamma Hall raised a discussion saying: &ldquo;Sirs, a Tathāgata, a delicately nurtured noble and Buddha, though possessed of Supernormal Powers, at the invitation of a brahmin of Verañjā stayed three ṁonths with him, and when owing to the temptation of Māra he failed to receive an alms at the hands of the brahmin, even for a single day, he gave up all covetous ways, and keeping in the same place for three months lived on water and a modicum of the ground flour of roots. </span><span class="t18">{3.495}</span><span class="t30"> Oh the contented nature of Tathāgatas!&rdquo; When the Teacher came and on inquiry learned the nature of their discussion he said: &ldquo;It is no marvel, monks, that a Tathāgata now has lost all covetousness, seeing that formerly when born in an animal form he forsook covetousness.&rdquo; And hereupon he told a story of the past. The whole story is now to be related in detail in exactly the same way as in the preceding tale [Ja 429].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past many myriads of parrots lived in the Himālayas on the banks of the Ganges in a grove of fig trees. A king of the parrots there, when the fruit of the tree in which he dwelt had come to an end, ate whatever was left, whether shoot or leaf or bark or rind, and drank of water from the Ganges, and being very happy and contented he kept where he was. Owing to his happy and contented state the abode of Sakka was shaken. Sakka reflecting on the cause saw the parrot, and to test his virtue, by his supernatural power he withered up the tree, which became a mere stump perforated with holes, and stood to be buffeted by every blast of wind, and from the holes dust came out. The parrot king ate this dust and drank the water of the Ganges, and going nowhere else sat perched on the top of the fig-stump, thinking nothing of wind and sun.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Sakka noticed how very contented the parrot was, and said: &ldquo;After hearing him speak of the virtue of friendship, I will come and give him his choice of a boon, and cause the fig tree to bear ambrosial fruit.&rdquo; So he took the form of a royal goose, and preceded by Sujā in the shape of an Asura maiden, he went to the grove of fig trees, and perching on the bough of a tree close by, he entered into conversation with the parrot and spoke the first verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Lo! Countless trees are here, all green and fruitful see!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why, parrot, do you cling to this poor withered tree?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Long years we have enjoyed the luscious fruit it bare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And tho&rsquo; it now has none, it still should claim our care.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9947"></a><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Nor leaves nor fruit it yields, alas, the tree is dead:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why blame your fellow-birds, that they should all have fled?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;They loved it for its fruit, and now that it has none,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Poor selfish fools! Their love and gratitude is gone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Your gratitude I own,</span><a id="a9948"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15732"><span class="t19">{713}</span></a><span class="t12"> your true and constant love,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sure virtue such as this the wise will aye approve.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;I offer you, O bird, whate&rsquo;er you will for choice;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell me, I pray, what boon would most your heart rejoice?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Would that this tree alight bear fresh leaves and fruit again;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I would be glad as they that treasure trove obtain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. Then was the tree by Sakka with ambrosia sprinkled o&rsquo;er,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And boughs sprang up with cooling shade, as lovely as before.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is ready to disrobe after seeing a beautiful woman. The Buddha tells a story of an ascetic who was overcome by seeing the queen naked, how he could not lie about it to the king, and how he threw off passion.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Friend Hārita.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.295] </span><span class="t30">This story the Teacher dwelling at Jetavana told concerning a discontented monk. Now this monk after seeing a smartly attired woman grew discontented and allowed his hair and nails to grow long, and wished to return to the world. And when he was brought against his will by his teachers and preceptors to the Teacher, and was asked by him, if it were true that he was discontent, and if so why, he said: &ldquo;Yes, your reverence, it is owing to the power of sinful passion, after seeing a beautiful woman.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.497}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher said: &ldquo;Doing wrong, monk, is destructive of virtue, and insipid withal, and causes a man to be reborn in hell; and why should not this wrong prove your destruction? For the hurricane that smites Mount Sineru is not ashamed to carry off a withered leaf. But owing to this wrong men who walk according to knowledge and wisdom, and have acquired the five Super Knowledges and the eight Attainments, though they were great and holy men, being unable to fix their thoughts, fell away from Absorption.&rdquo; And then he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a certain village in a brahmin family worth eighty crores, and from his golden complexion they called him Hāritatacakumāra (Young Goldskin). When he was grown up, and had been educated at Taxila, he set up as a householder, and on the death of his father and mother he made inspection of his treasures and thought: &ldquo;The treasure only continues to exist, but they who produced it cease to exist: I too must be reduced to atoms by means of death,&rdquo; and alarmed by the fear of death he gave great gifts, and entering the Himālayas he adopted the ascetic life, and on the seventh day he entered upon the Super Knowledges and Attainments.</p>
<p class="p7">There for a long time he lived on wild fruit and roots, and going down from the mountain to procure salt and vinegar, he in due course reached Benares. There he lived in the royal park, and on the next day in going his round for alms he came to the door of the king&rsquo;s palace. The king was so glad to see him that he sent for him and made him sit on the royal couch beneath the shade of the white umbrella, and fed him on all manner of dainties, and on his returning thanks the king being exceedingly pleased asked him, &ldquo;Venerable sir, where are you going?&rdquo; &ldquo;Great king, we are looking out for a dwelling-place for the rainy season.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, venerable sir,&rdquo; he said, and after the early meal he went with him to the park, and had quarters both for the day and night built for him, and, assigning the keeper of the park as his attendant, he saluted him and departed. The Great Being from that time fed continually in the palace, and lived there twelve years. <span class="t18">[3.296]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now one day the king went to quell a disturbance on the frontier, <span class="t18">{3.498}</span> and committed the Bodhisatta to the care of the queen, saying: &ldquo;Do not neglect our &lsquo;Field of Merit.&rsquo; &rdquo; Thenceforth she ministered to the Great Being with her own hands.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9958"></a>Now one day she had prepared his food, and as he delayed his coming, she bathed in scented water, and put on a soft tunic of fine cloth, and opening the lattice lay down on a small couch, and let the wind play upon her body. And the Bodhisatta later on in the day, dressed in a goodly inner and outer robe, took his alms-bowl and walking through the air came to the window. As the queen rose up in haste, at the rustling sound of his bark garments, her robe of fine cloth fell from off her. An object marking the opposite sex struck upon the eye of the Great Being. Then the sinful feeling, that had been dwelling for countless aeons in his heart, rose up like a snake lying in a box, and put to flight his Absorption. Being unable to fix his thoughts he went and seized the queen by the hand, and forthwith they drew a curtain round them. After misconducting himself with her, he partook of some food and returned to the park. And every day thenceforth he acted after the same manner.</p>
<p class="p7">His misconduct was blazed abroad throughout the whole city. The king&rsquo;s ministers sent a letter to him, saying: &ldquo;Hārita, the ascetic, is acting thus and thus.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king thought: &ldquo;They say this, being eager to separate us,&rdquo; and disbelieved it. When he had pacified the border country he returned to Benares, and after marching in solemn procession round the city, he went to the queen and asked her, &ldquo;Is it true that the holy ascetic Hārita misconducted himself with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true, my lord.&rdquo; He disbelieved her also, and thought: &ldquo;I will ask the man himself,&rdquo; and going to the park he saluted him, and sitting respectfully on one side he spoke the first verse in the form of a question:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9959"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Friend Hārita, I oft have heard it said</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A sinful life is by your reverence led;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I trust there is no truth in this report,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And you are innocent in deed and thought?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.499}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9960"></a>He thought: &ldquo;If I were to say I am not indulging in wrong, this king would believe me, but in this world there is no sure ground like speaking the truth. They who forsake the truth, though they sit in the sacred enclosure of the Bo tree, cannot attain to Buddhahood. I must needs just speak the truth.&rdquo; In certain cases a Bodhisatta may destroy life, take what is not given him, commit adultery, drink strong drink, but he may not tell a lie, attended by deception that violates the reality of things. Therefore speaking the truth only he uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;In evil ways, great king, as you have heard,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Caught by the world&rsquo;s delusive arts, I erred.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.297]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this the king spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Vain is man&rsquo;s deepest wisdom to dispel</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The passions that within his bosom swell.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Hārita pointed out to him the power of doing wrong and spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;There are four passions in this world, great king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That in their power are over-mastering:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lust, hate, excess and ignorance their name;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wisdom can here no certain footing claim.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.500}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king on hearing this spoke the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Endowed with holiness and intellect</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The saintly Hārita wins our respect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Hārita spoke the sixth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Ill thoughts, with pleasant vices if combined,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Corrupt the sage to saintliness inclined.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the king, encouraging him to throw off sinful passion, spoke the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;The beauty that from purest hearts does shine</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is marred by lust, born of this mortal frame;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Away with it, and blessings shall be thine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And multitudes your wisdom shall proclaim.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta recovered the power to concentrate his thoughts, and observing the misery of wicked desire, he spoke the eighth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Since blinding passions yield a bitter fruit,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All growth of lust I cut down to the root.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.501}</span></p>
<p class="p6">So saying he asked the king&rsquo;s leave, and having gained his consent he entered his ascetic hut, and focusing on the Meditation Object he entered into an Absorption, and came forth from the hut, and sitting cross-legged in the air he taught the king the true Dhamma and said: &ldquo;Great king, I have incurred censure in the midst of the people by reason of my dwelling in a place where I ought not. But be you vigilant. Now will I return to some forest free from all taint of womankind.&rdquo; And amidst the tears and lamentations of the king he returned to the Himālayas, and without falling away from Absorption he entered the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher knowing the whole story said:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9961"></a><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;Thus Hārita for truth right stoutly did contend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And lust forsaking did to Brahmā Realm ascend.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">And having after Fully Awakening spoken this verse, he declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the worldly-minded monk became an Arahat, &ldquo;At that time the king was Ānanda, Hārita was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

He was, they say, the son of a householder at Sāvatthi, just seven years old, and skilled in recognizing footsteps. Now his father being minded to prove him went without his knowing it to a friend&rsquo;s house. The boy, without even asking where his father had gone, by tracing his footsteps, came and stood before him. So his father one day asked him saying: &ldquo;When I went off without telling you, how did you know where I was gone?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.502}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;My dear father, I recognized your footsteps. I am skilled in this way.&rdquo; Then his father, to prove him, went out of his house after the early meal, and going into his next-door neighbour&rsquo;s house, from it passed into another, and from this third house again returned to his own home, and thence made his way to the north gate, and passing out by it made a circuit of the city from right to left. And coming to Jetavana he saluted the Teacher and sat down to listen to the Dhamma. The boy asked where his father was, and when they said: &ldquo;We do not know,&rdquo; by tracing his father&rsquo;s steps, and starting from the next-door neighbour&rsquo;s house he went by the same road by which his father had travelled to Jetavana, and after saluting the Teacher stood in the presence of his father, and when asked by him, how he knew that he had come here, he said: &ldquo;I recognized your footsteps and following in your track came here.&rdquo; The Teacher asked, &ldquo;Lay brother, what are you saying?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Your reverence, this boy is skilled in knowing footsteps. To test him I came here in such and such a manner. Not finding me at home, by following in my footsteps, he arrived here.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no marvel,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;in recognizing steps upon the ground. Sages of old recognized steps in the air,&rdquo; and on being asked, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9971"></a>In the past in the reign of Brahmadatta, king of Benares, his queen-consort after doing wrong was questioned by the king, and taking an oath she said: &ldquo;If I have wronged against you, I shall become a Yakkhini with a face like a horse.&rdquo; After her death she became a horse-faced Yakkhini and dwelt in a rock-cave in a vast forest at the foot of a mountain, and used to catch and devour the men that frequented the road leading from the east to the western border.</p>
<p class="p7">After serving Vessavaṇa<a id="a9972"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15734"><span class="t9">{714}</span></a><a id="a9973"></a> three years, it is said, she got leave to eat people in a certain space, thirty leagues long by five leagues broad. Now one day a rich, wealthy, handsome brahmin, accompanied by a large suite, ascended that road. The Yakkhini, on seeing him, with a loud laugh rushed upon him, and his attendants all fled. With the speed of the wind she seized the brahmin <span class="t18">{3.503}</span> and threw him on her back, and in entering the cave, through coming into contact with the man, under the influence of passion she conceived an affection <span class="t18">[3.299] </span>for him, and instead of devouring him she made him her husband, and they lived harmoniously together. And thenceforth the Yakkhini, whenever she captured men, also took their clothes and rice and oil and the like, and serving him with various dainty food she herself would eat the man&rsquo;s flesh. And whenever she went away, for fear of his escaping, she closed the mouth of the cave with a huge stone before leaving.</p>
<p class="p7">And while they were thus living amicably together, the Bodhisatta passing from his former existence was conceived in the womb of the Yakkhini by the brahmin. After ten months she gave birth to a son, and filled with love for the brahmin and her child, she fed them both. By and by when the boy was grown up, she put him also inside the cave with his father, and closed the door. Now one day the Bodhisatta knowing she had gone away removed the stone and let his father out. And when she asked on her return who had removed the stone, he said: &ldquo;I did, mother: we cannot sit in darkness.&rdquo; And through love for her child she did not say another word.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day the Bodhisatta asked his father, saying: &ldquo;Dear father, your mouth is different from my mother&rsquo;s; what is the reason?&rdquo; &ldquo;My son, your mother is a Yakkhini and lives on man&rsquo;s flesh, but you and I are men.&rdquo; &ldquo;If so, why do we live here? Come, we will go to the haunts of men.&rdquo; &ldquo;My dear boy, if we shall try to escape, your mother will kill us both.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta reassured his father and said: &ldquo;Do not be afraid, dear father; that you shall return to the haunts of men shall be my charge.&rdquo; And next day when his mother had gone away, he took his father and fled.</p>
<p class="p7">When the Yakkhini returned and missed them, she rushed forward with the swiftness of the wind and caught them and said: &ldquo;O brahmin, why do you run away? Is there anything that you want here?&rdquo; &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do not be angry with me. <span class="t18">{3.504}</span> Your son carried me off with him.&rdquo; And without another word, owing to her love for her child, she comforted them and making for her place of abode she brought them back after a flight of some days. The Bodhisatta thought: &ldquo;My mother must have a limited sphere of action. Suppose I were to ask her the limits of space over which her authority extends. Then I will escape by going beyond this.&rdquo; So one day sitting respectfully near his mother he said: &ldquo;My dear, that which belongs to a mother comes to the children; tell me now what is the boundary of our ground.&rdquo; She told him all the landmarks, mountains and such like in all directions, and pointed out to her son the space, thirty leagues long and five leagues broad, and said: &ldquo;Consider it to be so much, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">After the lapse of two or three days, when his mother had gone to the forest, he put his father on his shoulder and rushing on with the swiftness of the wind, by the hint given him by his mother, he reached the bank of the river that was the limit. The mother too, when on her return she missed them, pursued after them. The Bodhisatta carried his father into the middle of the river, and she <span class="t18">[3.300] </span>came and stood on the river bank, and when she saw that they had passed beyond the limits of her sphere, she stopped where she was, and cried, &ldquo;My dear child, come here with your father. What is my offence? In what respect do things not go well with you? Come back, my lord.&rdquo; Thus did she beseech her child and husband. So the brahmin crossed the river. She prayed to her child also, and said: &ldquo;Dear son, do not act after this sort: come back again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother, we are men: you are a Yakkhini. We cannot always abide with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;And will you not return?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then if you refuse to return &ndash; as it is painful to live in the world of men, and they who know not any craft cannot live &ndash; I am skilled in the lore of the philosopher&rsquo;s stone: by its power, one can follow after the lapse of twelve years in the steps of those that have gone away. This will prove a livelihood to you. Take, my child, this invaluable charm.&rdquo; And though overcome by such great sorrow, through love of her child, she gave him the charm. <span class="t18">{3.505}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta, still standing in the river, folded his hands turtle-wise and took the charm, and saluting his mother cried, &ldquo;Good-bye, mother.&rdquo; The Yakkhini said: &ldquo;If you do not return, my son, I cannot live,&rdquo; and she smote upon her breast, and straightaway in sorrow for her son her heart was broken and she fell down dead on the spot. The Bodhisatta, when he knew his mother was dead, called to his father and went and made a funeral pile and burned her body. After extinguishing the flames, he made offerings of various coloured flowers, and with weeping and lamentation returned with his father to Benares.</p>
<p class="p7">It was told the king, &ldquo;A youth skilled in tracking footsteps is standing at the door.&rdquo; And when the king bade him enter, he came in and saluted the king. &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you know any craft?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, following on the track of one who has stolen any property even twelve years ago, I can catch him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then enter my service,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;I will serve you for a thousand pieces of money daily.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, friend, you shall serve me.&rdquo; And the king had him paid a thousand pieces of money daily.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day the family priest said to the king, &ldquo;My lord, because this youth does nothing by the power of his art, we do not know whether he has any skill or not: we will now test him.&rdquo; The king readily agreed, and the pair gave notice to the keepers of the various treasures, and taking the most valuable jewels descended from the terrace, and after groping their way three times round the palace, they placed a ladder on the top of the wall and by means of it descended to the outside. Then they entered the Hall of Justice, and after sitting there they returned and again placing the ladder on the wall descended by it into the city. Coming to the edge of a tank they thrice marched solemnly round it, and then dropped their treasure in the tank, and climbed back to the terrace. <span class="t18">{3.506}</span></p>
<p class="p7">Next day there was a great outcry and men said: &ldquo;Treasure has been stolen from the palace.&rdquo; The king pretending ignorance summoned <span class="t18">[3.301] </span>the Bodhisatta and said: &ldquo;Friend, much valuable treasure has been stolen from the palace: we must trace it.&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, for one who is able to follow the traces of robbers and recover treasure stolen twelve years ago, there is nothing marvellous in his recovering stolen property after a single day and night. I will recover it; do not be troubled.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then recover it, friend.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, my lord,&rdquo; he said, and went and saluting his mother&rsquo;s memory he repeated the spell, still standing on the terrace, and said: &ldquo;My lord, the steps of two thieves are to be seen.&rdquo; And following in the steps of the king and the priest he entered the royal closet, and issuing thence he descended from the terrace, and after thrice making a circuit of the palace he drew near the wall. Standing on it he said: &ldquo;My lord, starting in this place from the wall I see footsteps in the air: bring me a ladder.&rdquo; And having had a ladder placed for him against the wall, he descended by it, and still following in their track he came to the Hall of Justice. Then returning to the palace he had the ladder planted against the wall, and descending by it he came to the tank. After thrice marching round it he said: &ldquo;My lord, the thieves went down into this tank,&rdquo; and taking out the treasure, as if he had deposited it there himself, he gave it to the king and said: &ldquo;My lord, these two thieves are men of distinction: by this way they climbed up into the palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The people snapped their fingers in a high state of delight, and there was a great waving of cloths. The king thought: &ldquo;This youth, I think, by following in their steps knows the place where the thieves put the treasure, but the thieves he cannot catch.&rdquo; Then he said: &ldquo;You at once brought us the property carried off by the thieves, but will you be able to catch the thieves and bring them to us?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, the thieves are here: they are not far off.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.507}</span> &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; &ldquo;Great king, let any one that likes be the thief. From the time you recovered your treasure, why should you want the thieves? Do not ask about that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, I pay you daily a thousand pieces of money: bring the thieves to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, when the treasure is recovered, what need of the thieves?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is better, friend, for us to catch the thieves than to recover the treasure.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, sire, I will not tell you, &lsquo;So and so are the thieves,&rsquo; but I will tell you a thing that happened long ago. If you are wise, you will know what it means.&rdquo; And herewith he told a story of the past.</p>
<p class="p7">In the past, sire, a certain dancer named Pāṭala lived not far from Benares, in a village on the river&rsquo;s bank. One day he went into Benares with his wife and after gaining money by his singing and dancing, at the end of the fete he procured some rice and strong drink. On his way to his own village he came to the bank of the river, and sat down watching the freshly flowing stream, to drink his strong drink. When he was drunk and unconscious of his weakness, he said: &ldquo;I will fasten my big lute about my neck and go down into the river.&rdquo; And he took his <span class="t18">[3.302] </span>wife by the hand and went down into the river. The water entered into the holes of the lute, and then the weight of his lute made him begin to sink. But when his wife saw he was sinking, she let go of him and went up out of the river and stood upon the bank. The dancer Pāṭala now rises and now sinks, and his belly became swollen from swallowing the water. So his wife thought: &ldquo;My husband will now die: I will beg of him one song, and by singing this in the midst of the people, I shall earn my living.&rdquo; And saying: &ldquo;My lord, you are sinking in the water: give me just one song, and I will earn my living by it,&rdquo; she spoke this verse: <a id="a9974"></a><span class="t18">{3.508}</span></p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a9975"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;O Pāṭala, by Ganges swept away,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">Famous in dance and, skilled in roundelay,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">Pāṭala, all hail! As you are borne along,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">Sing me, I pray, some little snatch of song.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9976"></a>Then the dancer Pāṭala said: &ldquo;My dear, how shall I give you a little song? The water that has been the refuge of the people is killing me,&rdquo; and he spoke a verse:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Wherewith are sprinkled fainting souls in pain,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">I straight am killed. My refuge proved my bane.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta in explanation of this verse said: &ldquo;Sire, even as water is the refuge of the people, so also is it with kings. If danger arises from them, who shall avert that danger? This, sire, is a secret matter. I have told a story intelligible to the wise: understand it, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, I understand not a hidden story like this. Catch the thieves and bring them to me.&rdquo; Then the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;Hear then this, sire, and understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And he told yet another tale.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My lord, formerly in a village outside the city gates of Benares, a potter used to fetch clay for his pottery, and constantly getting it in the same place he dug a deep pit inside a mountain cave. Now one day while he was getting the clay, an unseasonable storm-cloud sprang up, and let fall a heavy rain, and the flood overwhelmed and threw down the side of the pit, and the man&rsquo;s head was broken by it. Loudly lamenting he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;That by which seeds do grow, man to sustain,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">Has crushed my head. My refuge proved my bane.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;For even as the mighty earth, sire, which is the refuge of the people, broke the potter&rsquo;s head, even so when a king, who like the mighty earth is the refuge of the whole world, rises up and plays the thief, who shall avert the danger? Can you, sire, <span class="t18">{3.509}</span> recognize the thief hidden under the guise of this story?&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, we do not want any hidden meaning. Say, &lsquo;Here is the thief,&rsquo; and catch him and hand him over to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Still shielding the king and without saying in words, &ldquo;You are the thief,&rdquo; he told yet another story. <span class="t18">[3.303]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In this very city, sire, a certain man&rsquo;s house was on fire. He ordered another man to go into the house and bring out his property. When this man had entered the house and was bringing out his goods, the door was shut. Blinded with smoke and unable to find his way out and tormented by the rising flame, he remained inside lamenting, and spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;That which destroys the cold, and parches grain,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">Consumes my limbs. My refuge proves my bane.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;A man, O king, who like fire was the refuge of the people, stole the bundle of jewels. Do not ask me about the thief.&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, just bring me the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Without telling the king that he was a thief, he told yet another story.</p>
<p class="p7">Once, sire, in this very city a man ate to excess and was unable to digest his food. Maddened with pain and lamenting he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Food on which countless brahmins life sustain</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">Killed me outright. My refuge proved my bane.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;One, who like rice, sire, was the refuge of the people, stole the property. When that is recovered, why ask about the thief?&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, if you can, bring me the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">To make the king comprehend, he told yet another story. <span class="t18">{3.510}</span></p>
<p class="p7">Formerly, sire, in this very city a wind arose and broke a certain man&rsquo;s limbs. Lamenting he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Wind that in June wise men by prayer would gain,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">My limbs does break. My refuge proved my bane.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;Thus, sire, did danger arise from my refuge. Understand this story.&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, bring me the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">To make the king understand, he told him yet another story.</p>
<p class="p7">In the past, sire, on the side of the Himālayas grew a tree with forked branches, the dwelling-place of countless birds. Two of its boughs rubbed against one another. Hence arose smoke, and sparks of fire were let fall. On seeing this the chief bird uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p24"><a id="a9977"></a><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Flame issues from the tree where we have lain:</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">Scatter, you birds. Our refuge proves our bane.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;For just as, sire, the tree is the refuge of birds, so is the king the refuge of his people. Should he play the thief, who shall avert the danger? Take note of this, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, only bring me the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then he told the king yet another story.</p>
<p class="p7">In a village of Benares, sire, on the western side of a gentleman&rsquo;s house was a river full of savage crocodiles, and in this family was an only son, who on the death of his father watched over his mother. His mother against his will brought home a gentleman&rsquo;s daughter as his wife. At <span class="t18">[3.304] </span>first she showed affection for her mother-in-law, but afterwards when blessed with numerous sons and daughters of her own, she wished to get rid of her. Her own mother also lived in the same house. In her husband&rsquo;s presence she found all manner of fault with her mother-in-law, to prejudice him against her, saying: &ldquo;I cannot possibly support your mother: you must kill her.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.511}</span> And when he answered, &ldquo;Murder is a serious matter: how am I to kill her?&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;When she has fallen asleep, we will take her, bed and all, and throw her into the crocodile river. Then the crocodiles will make an end of her.&rdquo; &ldquo;And where is your mother?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She sleeps in the same room as your mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then go and set a mark on the bed on which she lies, by fastening a rope on it.&rdquo; She did so, and said: &ldquo;I have put a mark on it.&rdquo; The husband said: &ldquo;Excuse me a moment; let the people go to bed first.&rdquo; And he lay down pretending to go to sleep, and then went and fastened the rope on his mother-in-law&rsquo;s bed. Then he woke his wife, and they went together and lifting her up, bed and all, threw her into the river. And the crocodiles there killed and ate her.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day she found out what had happened to her own mother and said: &ldquo;My lord, my mother is dead, now let us kill yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will make a funeral pile in the cemetery, and cast her into the fire and kill her.&rdquo; So the man and his wife took her while she was asleep to the cemetery, and deposited her there. Then the husband said to his wife, &ldquo;Have you brought any fire?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have forgotten it, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then go and fetch it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I dare not go, my lord, and if you go, I dare not stay here: we will go together.&rdquo; When they were gone, the old woman was awakened by the cold wind, and finding it was a cemetery, she thought: &ldquo;They wish to kill me: they are gone to fetch fire. They do not know how strong I am.&rdquo; And she stretched a corpse on the bed and covered it over with a cloth, and ran away and hid herself in a mountain cave in that same place.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9978"></a><a id="a9979"></a>The husband and wife brought the fire and taking the corpse to be the old woman they burned it and went away. A certain robber had left his bundle in this mountain cave and coming back to fetch it he saw the old woman and thought: &ldquo;This must be a Yakkhini: my bundle is possessed by Amanussas,&rdquo; and he fetched a witch-doctor. The doctor uttered a spell and entered the cave. Then she said to him, &ldquo;I am no Yakkhini: come, we will enjoy this treasure together.&rdquo; &ldquo;How is this to be believed?&rdquo; &ldquo;Place your tongue on my tongue.&rdquo; He did so, and she bit a piece off his tongue and let it drop to the ground. The witch-doctor thought: &ldquo;This is certainly a Yakkhini,&rdquo; and he cried aloud and fled away, with the blood dripping from his tongue. <span class="t18">{3.512}</span></p>
<p class="p7">Next day the old woman put on a clean undergarment and took the bundle of all sorts of jewels and went home. The daughter-in-law on seeing her asked, &ldquo;Where, mother, did you get this?&rdquo; &ldquo;My dear, all that are burned on a wooden pile in this cemetery receive <span class="t18">[3.305] </span>the same.&rdquo; &ldquo;My dear mother, can I too get this?&rdquo; &ldquo;If you become like me, you will.&rdquo; So without saying a word to her husband, in her desire for a lot of ornaments to wear, she went there and burned herself. Her husband next day missed her and said: &ldquo;My dear mother, at this time of day is not your daughter-in law coming?&rdquo; Then she reproached him saying: &ldquo;Fie! You bad man, how do the dead come back?&rdquo; And she uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;A maiden fair, with wreath upon her head,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">Fragrant with sandal oil, by me was led</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">A happy bride within my home to reign:</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">She drove me forth. My refuge proved my bane.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;As the daughter-in-law, sire, is to the mother-in-law, so is the king a refuge to his people. If danger arises thence, what can one do? Take note of this, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, I do not understand the things you tell me: only bring me the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">He thought: &ldquo;I will shield the king,&rdquo; and he told yet another story.</p>
<p class="p7">Of old, sire, in this very city a man in answer to his prayer had a son. At his birth the father was full of joy and gladness at the thought of having got a son, and cherished him. When the boy was grown up, he wedded him to a wife, and by and by he himself grew old and could not undertake any work. So his son said: &ldquo;You cannot do any work: you must go from hence,&rdquo; and he drove him out of the house. <span class="t18">{3.513}</span> With great difficulty he kept himself alive on alms, and lamenting he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;He for whose birth I longed, nor longed in vain,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">Drives me from home. My refuge proved my bane.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;Just as an aged father, sire, ought to be cared for by an able-bodied son, so too ought all the people to be protected by the king, and this danger now present has arisen from the king, who is the guardian of all men. Know, sire, from this fact that the thief is so and so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I do not understand this, be it fact or no fact: either bring me the thief, or you yourself must be the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Thus did the king again and again question the youth. So he said to him, &ldquo;Would you, sire, really like the thief to be caught?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, friend.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I will proclaim it in the midst of the assembly, So and So is the thief.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do so, friend.&rdquo; On hearing his words he thought: &ldquo;This king does not allow me to shield him: I will now catch the thief.&rdquo; And when the people had gathered together, he addressed them and spoke these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Let town and country folk assembled all give ear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lo! Water is ablaze. From safety cometh fear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. The plundered realm may well of king and priest complain;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Henceforth protect yourselves. Your refuge proves your bane.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.306] {3.514}</span></p>
<p class="p6">When they heard what he said, people thought: &ldquo;The king, though he ought to have protected others, threw the blame on another. After he had with his own hands placed his treasure in the tank, he went about looking for the thief. That he may not in future go on playing the part of a thief, we will kill this wicked king.&rdquo; So they rose up with sticks and clubs in their hands, and then and there beat the king and the priest till they died. But they anointed the Bodhisatta and set him on the throne.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, after relating this story to illustrate the Truths, said: &ldquo;Lay brother, there is nothing marvellous in recognizing footsteps on the earth: sages of old recognized them in the air,&rdquo; and he identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the lay brother and his son attained to fruition of the First Path, &ldquo;In those days the father was Kassapa, the youth skilled in footsteps was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk longs to return to the lay life. The Buddha tells a story of an ascetic of old who was tempted to perform a sacrifice through desire for a princess, but realised his projected deed was wrong, and repented of it.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;A king like Sakka.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher dwelling at Jetavana told concerning a worldly-minded monk. The Teacher asked him if he were longing for the world, and when he admitted that it was so, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monk, even men of the highest fame sometimes incur infamy. Defilements like these defile even pure beings; much more one like you.&rdquo; And then he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past prince Brahmadatta, son of Brahmadatta king of Benares, and the son of his family priest named Kassapa, <span class="t18">{3.515}</span> were schoolmates and learned all the sciences in the house of the same teacher. By and by the young prince on his father&rsquo;s death was established in the kingdom. Kassapa thought: &ldquo;My friend has become king, he will bestow great power on me, what have I to do with power? I will take leave of the king and my parents, and become an ascetic.&rdquo; So he went into the Himālayas and adopted the ascetic life, and on the seventh day he entered on the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and gained his living by what he gleaned in the fields. And men nicknamed the ascetic Lomasakassapa (Hairy Kassapa).</p>
<p class="p7">With his senses mortified he became an ascetic of <span class="t18">[3.307] </span>grim austerity. And by virtue of his austerity the abode of Sakka was shaken. Sakka, reflecting on the cause, observed him and thought: &ldquo;This ascetic, by the exceedingly fierce fire of his virtue, would make me fall even from the abode of Sakka. After a secret interview with the king of Benares, I will break down his austerity.&rdquo; By the power of a Sakka he entered the royal closet of the king of Benares at midnight and illuminated all the chamber with the radiance of his form, and standing in the air before the king he woke him up and said: &ldquo;Sire, arise,&rdquo; and when the king asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I am Sakka.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wherefore are you come?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, do you desire sole rule in all Jambudīpa or not?&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo; So Sakka said: &ldquo;Then bring Lomasakassapa here and bid him offer a sacrifice of slain beasts, and you shall become, like Sakka, exempt from old age and death, and exercise rule throughout all Jambudīpa,&rdquo; and he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9990"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;A king like Sakka you shall be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ne&rsquo;er doomed old age or death to see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should Kassapa by your advice</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Offer a living sacrifice.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing his words the king readily assented. Sakka said: &ldquo;Then make no delay,&rdquo; and so departed. <span class="t18">{3.516}</span><a id="a9991"></a> Next day the king summoned a councillor named Sayha and said: &ldquo;Good sir, go to my dear friend Lomasakassapa and in my name speak thus to him, &ldquo;The king by persuading you to offer a sacrifice will become sole ruler in all Jambudīpa, and he will grant you as much land as you desire, come with me to offer sacrifice.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Very well, sire,&rdquo; and made proclamation by beat of drum to learn the place where the ascetic dwelt, and when a certain forester said: &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Sayha went there under his guidance with a large following, and saluting the sage sat respectfully on one side and delivered his message. Then he said to him, &ldquo;Sayha, what is this you say?&rdquo; and refusing him he spoke these four verses:<a id="a9992"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15736"><span class="t9">{715}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;No island realm, safe-guarded in the sea,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Shall tempt me, Sayha, to this cruelty.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. A curse upon the lust of fame and gain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whence spring the defilements that lead to pain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Better, as homeless waif, to beg one&rsquo;s bread</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Than by a crime bring shame upon my head.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. Yea better, bowl in hand, to flee from wrong</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Than by such cruelty a kingdom win.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The councillor, after hearing what he said, went and told the king. Thought the king, &ldquo;Should he refuse to come, what can I do?&rdquo; and kept silent. <span class="t18">{3.517}</span> But Sakka at midnight came and stood in the air and said,<span class="t18"> [3.308] </span>&ldquo;Why, sire, do you not send for Lomasakassapa and bid him offer sacrifice?&rdquo; &ldquo;When he is sent for, he refuses to come.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, adorn your daughter, princess Candavatī, and send her by the hand of Sayha and bid him say, &lsquo;If you will come and offer sacrifice, the king will give you this maiden to wife.&rsquo; Clearly he will be struck with love of the maiden and will come.&rdquo; The king readily agreed, and next day sent his daughter by the hand of Sayha.</p>
<p class="p7">Sayha took the king&rsquo;s daughter and went there, and after the usual salutation and compliments to the sage, he presented to him the princess, as lovely as a Devaccharā, and stood at a respectful distance. The ascetic losing his moral sense looked at her, and with the mere look he fell away from meditation. The councillor seeing that he was smitten with love said: &ldquo;Your reverence, if you will offer sacrifice, the king will give you this maiden to wife.&rdquo; He trembled with the power of passion and said: &ldquo;Will he surely give her to me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, if you offer sacrifice, he will.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;If I get her, I will sacrifice,&rdquo; and taking her with him, just as he was, ascetic locks and all, he mounted a splendid chariot and went to Benares.</p>
<p class="p7">But the king, as soon as he heard he was certainly coming, prepared for the ceremony in the sacrificial pit. So when he saw that he was come, he said: &ldquo;If you offer sacrifice, I shall become equal to Sakka, and when the sacrifice is completed, I will give you my daughter.&rdquo; Kassapa readily assented. So the king next day went with Candavatī to the sacrificial pit. There all four-footed beasts, elephants, horses, bulls and the rest were placed in a line. Kassapa attempted to offer sacrifice by killing and slaying them all. Then the people that were gathered together there said, <span class="t18">{3.518}</span> &ldquo;This is not proper or befitting you, Lomasakassapa, why do you act thus?&rdquo; And lamenting they uttered two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Both sun and moon bear potent sway,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And tides no power on earth can stay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brahmins and priests almighty are,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But womankind is mightier far.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. E&rsquo;en so Candavatī did win</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Grim Kassapa to deadly wrong,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And urged him by her sire&rsquo;s device</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9993"></a><span class="t12">To offer living sacrifice.&rdquo;</span><a id="a9994"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15738"><span class="t19">{716}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">At this moment Kassapa, to offer sacrifice, lifted up his precious sword to strike the royal elephant on the neck. The elephant at the sight of the sword, terrified with the fear of death, uttered a loud cry. On hearing his cry the other beasts too, elephants, horses, and bulls through fear of death uttered loud cries, and the people also cried aloud. Kassapa, on hearing these loud cries, grew excited and reflected on his matted hair. Then he became conscious of matted locks and beard, and the hair upon his body <span class="t18">[3.309] </span>and breast. Full of remorse he cried, &ldquo;Alas, I have done a sinful deed, unbecoming my character,&rdquo; and showing his emotion he spoke the eighth verse: <span class="t18">{3.519}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;This cruel act is of desire the fruit;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The growth of lust I&rsquo;ll cut down to the root.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the king said: &ldquo;Friend, fear not, offer the sacrifice, and I will now give you the princess Candavatī, and my kingdom and a pile of the seven treasures.&rdquo; On hearing this Kassapa said: &ldquo;Sire, I do not want this defilement,&rdquo; and spoke the concluding verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;Curse on the sensual desires upon this earth so rife,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Better by far than these the ascetic life;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will forsaking wrong an ascetic be:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Keep you your realm and fair Candavatī.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">With these words he focused on the Meditation Object, and recovering discrimination sat cross-legged in the air, teaching the Dhamma to the king, and, admonishing him to be zealous in good works, he bade him destroy the sacrificial pit and grant an amnesty to the people. And at the king&rsquo;s request, flying up into the air he returned to his own abode. And as long as he lived, he cultivated the Brahmā perfections and became destined to birth in the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher having ended his lesson revealed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the worldly-minded monk became an Arahat, &ldquo;In those days the great councillor Sayha was Sāriputta, Lomasakassapa was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

He was, it was said, greedy after the requisites and casting off all duties of master and pastor, entered Sāvatthi quite early, and after drinking excellent rice-gruel served with many a kind of solid food in the house of Visākhā, and after eating in the daytime various dainties, paddy, meat and boiled rice, not satisfied with this he went about thence </span><span class="t18">[3.310] </span><span class="t30">to the house of Culla Anāthapiṇḍika, and the king of Kosala, and various others.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So one day a discussion was raised in the Dhamma Hall concerning his greediness. When the Teacher heard what they were discussing, he sent for that monk and asked him if it were true that he was greedy. And when he said: &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Teacher asked, &ldquo;Why, monk, are you greedy? Formerly too through your greediness, not being satisfied with the dead bodies of elephants, you left Benares and wandering about on the bank of the Ganges, entered the Himālayas.&rdquo; And hereupon he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, a greedy crow went about eating the bodies of dead elephants, and not satisfied with them he thought: &ldquo;I will eat the fat of fish on the bank of the Ganges,&rdquo; and after staying a few days there eating dead fish he went into the Himālayas and lived on various kinds of wild fruits. Coming to a large lotus-tank abounding in fish and turtles, he saw there two golden-coloured geese who lived on the aquatic eelgrass plant. He thought: &ldquo;These birds are very beautiful and well-favoured: their food must be delightful. I will ask them what it is, and by eating the same I too shall become golden-coloured.&rdquo; So he went to them, and after the usual kindly greetings to them as they sat perched on the end of a bough, he spoke the first verse in connection with their praises:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Twin pair of birds in yellow dressed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So joyous roaming to and fro;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What kind of birds do men love best?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This is what I would want to know.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.521}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The ruddy goose on hearing this spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;O bird, of human kind the pest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We above other birds are blessed.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10010"></a><span class="t12">All lands with our devotion</span><a id="a10011"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15740"><span class="t19">{717}</span></a><span class="t12"> ring</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And men and birds our praises sing.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Know then that ruddy geese are we,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10012"></a><span class="t12">And fearless wander o&rsquo;er the sea.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10013"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15742"><span class="t19">{718}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this the crow spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;What fruits upon the sea abound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And whence may flesh for geese be found?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Say on what heavenly food you live,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Such beauty and such strength to give.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.522}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the ruddy goose spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;No fruits are on the sea to eat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And whence should ruddy geese have meat?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eelgrass plant, stripped of its skin,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yields food without a taint of sin.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.311]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the crow spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;I like not, goose, the words you use:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I once believed the food we choose</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To nourish us, ought to agree</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With what our outward form might be.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. But now I doubt it, for I eat</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Rice, salt, and oil, and fruit, and meat:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As heroes feast returned from fight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So I too in good cheer delight.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But though I live on dainty fare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My looks with yours may not compare.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.523}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the ruddy goose told the reason why the crow failed to attain to personal beauty, while he himself attained to it, and spoke the remaining verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Not satisfied with fruit, or garbage found</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Within the precincts of the charnel ground,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The greedy crow pursues in wanton flight</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The casual prey that tempts his appetite.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. But all that thus shall work their wicked will,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And for their pleasure harmless creatures kill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Upbraided by their conscience pine away,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And see their strength and comeliness decay.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. So happy beings that no creatures harm</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In form gain vigour and in looks a charm,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For beauty surely be it understood</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Depends not wholly on the kind of food.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.524}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the ruddy goose in many ways reproach the crow. And the crow having brought this reproach upon himself said: &ldquo;I want not your beauty.&rdquo; And with a cry of, &ldquo;Caw, Caw,&rdquo; he flew away.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, revealed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the greedy monk attained to fruition of the Second Path, &ldquo;In those days the crow was the greedy monk, the female goose was the mother of Rāhula, the male goose myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t34">There was then, we learn, a girl of about sixteen, daughter of a citizen of Sāvatthi, such as might bring good luck to a man, yet no man chose her. So her mother thought to herself, &ldquo;This my daughter is of full age, yet no one chooses her. I will use her as bait for a fish, and make one of those Sākiyan ascetics come back to the world, and live upon him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At the time there was a young man of good birth living in Sāvatthi, who had given his heart to the dispensation and went forth. But from the time when he had received full ordination he had lost all desire for learning, and lived devoted to the adornment of his</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t34">person.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The lay sister used to prepare in her house rice gruel, and other food hard or soft, and standing at the door, as the monks walked along the streets, looked out for someone who could be tempted by the craving for delicacies. Streaming by went a crowd of monks who upheld the Three Baskets, including the Abhidhamma and the Vinaya; but among them she saw none ready to rise to her bait. Among the figures with bowl and robe, preachers of the Dhamma with honey-sweet voice, moving like fleecy scud before the wind, she saw not one.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But at last she perceived a man approaching, the outer corners of his eyes anointed, hair hanging down, wearing an under-robe of fine cloth, and an outer robe shaken and cleansed, bearing a bowl coloured like some precious gem, and a sunshade after his own heart, a man who let his senses have their own way, his body much bronzed. &ldquo;Here is a man I can catch!&rdquo; thought she; and greeting him, she took his bowl, and invited him into the house. She found him a seat, and provided rice gruel and all the rest; then after the meal, begged him to make that house his resort in future. So he used to visit the house after that, and in course of time became intimate.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">One day, the lay sister said in his hearing, &ldquo;In this household we are happy enough, only I have no son or son-in-law capable of keeping it up.&rdquo; The man heard it, and wondering what reason she could have for so saying, in a little while he was as it were pierced to the heart. She said to her daughter, &ldquo;Tempt this man, and get him into your power.&rdquo; So the girl after that time decked herself and adorned herself, and tempted him with all women&rsquo;s tricks and wiles. Then the man, being young and under the power of passion, thought in his heart, &ldquo;I cannot now hold on to the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation,&rdquo; and he went to the monastery, and laying down bowl and robe, said to his spiritual teachers, &ldquo;I am discontented.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then they conducted him to the Teacher, and said: &ldquo;Sir, this monk is discontented.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is this true which they say,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;that you are discontented, monk?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir, true it is.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then what made you so?&rdquo; &ldquo;A sensual girl, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monk,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;long, long ago, when you were living in the forest, this same girl was a hindrance to your holiness, and did you great harm; then why are you again discontented on her account?&rdquo; Then at the request of the monks he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10023"></a><span class="t11">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a brahmin family of great wealth, and after his education was finished managed the estate. Then his wife brought forth a son, and died. He thought: &ldquo;As with my beloved wife, so with me death shall not be ashamed;</span><a id="a10024"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15746"><span class="t24">{720}</span></a><span class="t11"> what is a home to me? I will become an ascetic.&rdquo; So forsaking his sensual desires, he went with his son to the Himālayas; and there with him entered upon the ascetic life, developed the Absorptions and Super Knowledges, and dwelt in the woods, supporting life on fruits and roots.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">At that time the borderers raided the countryside; and having assailed a town, and taken prisoners, laden with spoil they returned to the border. Amongst them was a maiden, beautiful, but endowed with all a deceitful person&rsquo;s cunning. This girl thought to herself, &ldquo;These men, when they have carried us off home, will use us as slaves; I must find some</span><span class="t35"> </span><a id="a10025"></a><span class="t11">way to escape.&rdquo; So she said: &ldquo;My lord, I wish to retire; let me go and stay away for a moment.&rdquo; Thus she deceived the robbers, and fled.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now the Bodhisatta had gone out to fetch fruits and the like, leaving his son in the hut.</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now in the old legend this maiden knew that if the young ascetic should break the moral law, he would be in her power, and thinking to cajole him and bring him back to the haunts of men, she said: &ldquo;Virtue that is safe-guarded in a forest, where the qualities of sense such as beauty and the like have no existence, does not prove very fruitful, but it bears abundant fruit in the haunts of men, in the immediate presence of beauty and the like. So come with me and guard your virtue there. What have you to do with a forest?&rdquo; And she uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;In lonesome forest one may well be pure,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis easy there temptation to endure;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But in a village with seductions rife,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A man may rise to a far nobler life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the young ascetic said: &ldquo;My father is gone into the forest. When he returns, I will ask his leave and then accompany you.&rdquo; She thought, <span class="t18">{3.525}</span><a id="a10026"></a> &ldquo;He has a father, it seems; if he should find me here, he will strike me with the end of his carrying-pole and kill me, I must be off beforehand.&rdquo; So she said to the youth, &ldquo;I will start on the road before you, and leave a trail behind me, you are to follow me.&rdquo; When she had left him, he neither fetched wood, nor brought water to drink, but just sat meditating, and when his father arrived, he did not go out to meet him. So the father knew that his son had fallen into the power of a woman and he said: &ldquo;Why, my son, did you neither fetch wood nor bring me water to drink, nor food to eat, but why do you do nothing but sit and meditate?&rdquo; The youthful ascetic said: &ldquo;Father, men say that virtue that has to be guarded in a forest is not very fruitful, but that it brings forth much fruit in the haunts of men. I will go and guard my virtue there. My companion has gone forward, bidding me follow: so I will go with my companion. But when I am dwelling there, what manner of man am I to affect?&rdquo; And asking this question he spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;This doubt,</span><a id="a10027"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15748"><span class="t19">{721}</span></a><span class="t12"> my father, solve for me, I pray;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If to some village from this wood I stray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Men of what school of morals, or what sect</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Shall I most wisely for my friends affect?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then his father spoke and repeated the rest of the verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10028"></a><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;One that can gain your confidence and love,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Can trust your word, and with you patient prove,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. In thought and word and deed will ne&rsquo;er offend &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Take to your heart and cling to him as friend.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. To men capricious as the monkey kind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And found unstable, be not you inclined,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Though to some wilderness your lot&rsquo;s confined. </span><span class="t18">[3.313]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eschew foul ways, e&rsquo;en as you would keep clear</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7-8. Of angry serpent, or as charioteer </span><span class="t18">{3.526}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Avoids a rugged road. Sorrows abound</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whene&rsquo;er a man in folly&rsquo;s train is found:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Consort not you with fools &ndash; my voice obey &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The fool&rsquo;s companion is to grief a prey.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Being thus admonished by his father, the youth said: &ldquo;If I should go to the haunts of men, I should not find sages like you. I dread going there. I will dwell here in your presence.&rdquo; Then his father admonished him still further and taught him how to focus on the Meditation Object. And before long, the son developed the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and with his father became destined to birth in the Brahmā World.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, proclaimed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the monk who longed for the world attained to fruition of the First Path, &ldquo;In those days the young ascetic was the worldly-minded monk, the maiden then is the maiden now, but the father was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
