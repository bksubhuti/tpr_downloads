<p class="p7"><span class="t15">There is no story of the present. In the past Mahosadha has proven his wisdom in being able to solve many problems, and the king decides to send for him to come and be his advisor. His chief advisor Senaka sets one more problem for Mahosadha to solve concerning an ass.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;If you think that the father is better.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This Question as to the Ass will also be set out at length in the Ummaggajātaka [Ja 546].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2576"></a><a id="a2577"></a><a id="a2578"></a><span class="t11">With a great following the king set out for the village, mounted upon his royal horse. But as he went the horse put his foot into a hole and broke his leg; so the king turned back from that place to the town. Then Senaka entered the presence and said: &ldquo;Sire, did you go to the east market town to bring the sage back?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Senaka, &ldquo;you make me as one of no account. I begged you to wait awhile; but off you went in a hurry, and at the outset your royal horse broke his leg.&rdquo; The king had nothing to say to this.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Again on a day he asked Senaka, &ldquo;Shall we send for the sage, Senaka?&rdquo; &ldquo;If so, your majesty, don&rsquo;t go yourself but send a messenger, saying, O sage! As I was on my way to fetch you my horse broke his leg: send us a better horse and a more excellent one. If he takes the first alternative he will come himself, if the second he will send his father. Then will be a problem to test him.&rdquo; The king sent a messenger with this message. The sage on hearing it recognised that the king wished to see himself and</span><span class="t35"> </span><a id="a2579"></a><span class="t11">his father. So he went to his father, and greeting him said: &ldquo;Father, the king wishes to see you and me. You go first with a thousand merchants in attendance; and when you go, go not empty-handed, but take a sandalwood casket filled with fresh ghee. The king will speak kindly to you, and offer you a householder&rsquo;s seat; take it and sit down. When you are seated, I will come; the king will speak kindly to me and offer me such another seat. Then I will look at you; take the cue and say, rising from your seat, say, &lsquo;Son Mahosadha the wise, take this seat.&rsquo; Then the question will be ripe for solution.&rdquo; He did so.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">On arriving at the palace door he caused his arrival to be made known to the king, and on the king&rsquo;s invitation, he entered, and greeted the king, and stood on one side. The king spoke to him kindly, and asked where was his son the wise Mahosadha. &ldquo;Coming after me, my lord.&rdquo; The king was pleased to hear of his coming, and bade the father sit in a suitable place. He found a place and sat there. Meanwhile the Great Being dressed himself in all his splendour, and attended by the thousand youths he came seated in a magnificent chariot. As he entered the town he beheld an ass by the side of a ditch, and he directed some stout fellows to fasten up the mouth of the ass so that it should make no noise, to put him in a bag and carry him on their shoulders. They did so; the Bodhisatta entered the city with his great company. The people could not praise him enough. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;is the wise Mahosadha, the merchant Sirivaḍḍhaka&rsquo;s son; this they say is he, who was born holding a herb of virtue in his hand; he it is who knew the answers to so many problems set to test him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">On arriving before the palace he sent in word of his coming. The king was pleased to hear it and said: &ldquo;Let my son the wise Mahosadha make haste to come in.&rdquo; So with his attendants he entered the palace and saluted the king and stood on one side. The king was delighted to see him and spoke to him very sweetly, and bade him find a fit seat and sit down. He looked at his father, and his father at this cue rose up from his seat and invited him to sit there, which he did.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Thereupon the foolish men who were there, Senaka, Pukkusa, Kāvinda, Devinda, and others, seeing him sit there, clapped their hands and laughed loudly and cried, &ldquo;This is the blind fool they call wise! He has made his father rise from his seat, and sits there himself! Wise he should not be called surely.&rdquo; The king also was crestfallen. Then the Great Being said: &ldquo;Why, my lord! Are you sad?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, wise sir, I am sad. I was glad to hear of you, but to see you I am not glad.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because you have made your father rise from his seat, and sit there yourself.&rdquo; &ldquo;What, my lord! Do you think that in all cases the sire is better than the sons?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you not send word to me to bring you the better horse or the more excellent horse?&rdquo; So saying he rose up and looking towards the young fellows, said: &ldquo;Bring in the ass you have brought.&rdquo; Placing this ass before the king he went on, &ldquo;Sire, what is the price of this ass?&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;If it be serviceable, it is worth eight rupees.&rdquo; &ldquo;But if he get a mule colt out of a thoroughbred Sindh mare, what will the price of it be?&rdquo; &ldquo;It will be priceless.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why do you say that, my lord? Have you not just said that in all cases the sire is better than the sons? By your own saying the ass is worth more than the mule colt. Now have not your wise men clapped their hands and laughed at me because they did not know that? What wisdom is this of your wise men! Where did you get them?&rdquo; And in contempt for all four of them he addressed the king in this verse of the First Book:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">1. Haṁsi tuvaṁ evaṁ maññasi seyyo,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Puttena pitā ti rājaseṭṭha,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Handassatarassa te ayaṁ?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Assatarassa hi gadrabho pitā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t43">If you think that the father is better than the son, foremost king, come, is this better than your mule? For the ass is the mule&rsquo;s father.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t11">After this was said, he went on, &ldquo;My lord, if the sire is better than the son, take my sire into your service; if the son is better than the sire, take me.&rdquo; The king was delighted; and all the company cried out applauding and praising a thousand times, &ldquo;Well indeed has the wise man solved the question.&rdquo; There was a snapping of fingers and waving of a thousand scarves: the four were crestfallen.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2580"></a><span class="t11">Now no one knows better than the Bodhisatta the value of parents. If one ask then, why he did so: it was not to throw contempt on his father, but when the king sent the message, &ldquo;Send the better horse or the more excellent horse,&rdquo; he did thus in order to solve that problem, and to make his wisdom to be recognised, and to take the shine out of the four sages.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This is the end of the Question as to the Ass.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;By way of barley meal and by gruel.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This question too will be found in the same Jātaka [Ja 546].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2590"></a><span class="t11">From that day the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s glory was great, and queen Udumbarā managed it all. When he was sixteen she thought: &ldquo;My young brother has grown up, and great is his glory; we must find a wife for him.&rdquo; This she said to the king, and the king was well pleased. &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tell him.&rdquo; She told him, and he agreed, and she said: &ldquo;Then let us find you a bride, my son.&rdquo; The Great Being thought: &ldquo;I should never be satisfied if they choose me a wife; I will find one for myself.&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;Madam, do not tell the king for a few days, and I will go seek a wife to suit my taste, and then I will tell you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do so, my son,&rdquo; she replied.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">He took leave of the queen, and went to his house, and informed his companions. Then he got by some means the outfit of a tailor, and alone went out by the northern gate into north town. Now in that place was an ancient and decayed merchant family, and in this family was a daughter, the lady Amarā, a beautiful girl, wise, and with all the marks of good luck. That morning early, this girl had set out to the place where her father was plowing, to bring him rice-gruel which she had cooked, and it so happened that she went by the same road.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2591"></a><a id="a2592"></a><a id="a2593"></a><a id="a2594"></a><span class="t11">When the Great Being saw her coming he thought: &ldquo;A woman with all lucky marks! If she is unwed she must be my wife.&rdquo; When she beheld him she also thought: &ldquo;If I could live in the house of such a man, I might restore my family.&rdquo; The Great Being thought: &ldquo;Whether she be wed or not I do not know: I will ask her by hand-gesture, and if she be wise she will understand.&rdquo; So standing afar off he clenched his fist. She understood that he was asking whether she had a husband, and spread out her hand. Then he went up to her, and asked her name. She said: &ldquo;My name is that which neither is, nor was, nor ever shall be.&rdquo; &ldquo;Madam, there is nothing in the world immortal, and your name must be Amarā [Immortal].&rdquo; &ldquo;Even so, master.&rdquo; &ldquo;For whom, madam, do you carry that gruel?&rdquo; &ldquo;For the god of old time.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gods of old time are one&rsquo;s parents, and no doubt you mean your father.&rdquo; &ldquo;So it must be, master.&rdquo; &ldquo;What does your father do?&rdquo; &ldquo;He makes two out of one.&rdquo; Now the making of two out of one is plowing. &ldquo;He is plowing, madam.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even so, master.&rdquo; &ldquo;And where is your father plowing?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where those who go come not again.&rdquo; &ldquo;The place whence those who go come not again is the cemetery: he is plowing then near a cemetery.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even so, master.&rdquo; &ldquo;Will you come again today, madam?&rdquo; &ldquo;If it comes I will not come, if it comes not I will come.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your father, I think, madam, is plowing by a riverside, and if the flood comes you will not come, if it comes not you will.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">After this interchange of talk, the lady Amarā offered him a drink of the gruel. The Great Being, thinking it ungracious to refuse, said he would like some. Then she put down the jar of gruel; and the Great Being thought: &ldquo;If she offer it to me without first washing the pot and giving me water to wash my hands, I will leave her and go.&rdquo; But she took up water in the pot and offered him water for washing, placed the pot empty upon the ground not in his hands, stirred up the gruel in the jar, filled the pot with it. But there was not much rice in it, and the Great Being said: &ldquo;Why, madam, there is very little rice here!&rdquo; &ldquo;We got no water, master.&rdquo; &ldquo;You mean when your field was in growth, you got no water upon it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even so, master.&rdquo; So she kept some gruel for her father, and gave some to the Bodhisatta. He drank, and gargled his mouth, and said: &ldquo;Madam, I will go to your house; kindly show me the way.&rdquo; She did so by reciting a verse which is given in the First Book:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">1. Yena sattubilaṅgā ca,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Dviguṇapalāso ca pupphito,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Yena dadāmi, tena vadāmi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Yena na dadāmi, na tena vadāmi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Esa maggo Yavamajjhakassa,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Etaṁ channapathaṁ vijānāhī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t43">By way of barley meal and by gruel, and the flowering of the two-fold leaf, with the hand I give, by that I do speak, with the hand I don&rsquo;t give, by that I don&rsquo;t speak, this is the path to the Barley Market, this is the secret path that you must know.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t11">He reached the house by the way indicated; and Amarā&rsquo;s mother saw him and gave him a seat. &ldquo;May I offer you some gruel, master?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Thank you, mother &ndash; sister Amarā gave me a little.&rdquo; She at once recognized that he must have come on her daughter&rsquo;s account.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The Great Being, when he saw their poverty, said: &ldquo;Mother, I am a tailor: have you anything to mend?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, master, but nothing to pay.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no need to pay, mother; bring the things and I will mend them.&rdquo; She brought him some old clothes, and each as she brought it the Bodhisatta mended. The wise man&rsquo;s business always goes well, you know. He said then, &ldquo;Go tell the people in the street.&rdquo; She published it abroad in the village; and in one day by his tailoring the Great Being earned a thousand pieces of money. The old dame cooked him a midday meal, and in the evening asked how much she should cook. &ldquo;Enough, mother, for all those who live in this house.&rdquo; She cooked a quantity of rice with some curry and condiments.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now Amarā in the evening came back from the forest, bearing a faggot of wood upon her head and leaves on her hip. She threw down the wood before the front door and came in by the back door. Her father returned later. The Great Being ate of a tasty meal; the girl served her parents before herself eating, washed their feet and the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s feet. For several days he lived there watching her. Then one day to test her, he said: &ldquo;My dear Amarā, take half a measure of rice and with it make me gruel, a cake, and boiled rice.&rdquo; She agreed at once; and husked the rice; with the big grains she made gruel, the middling grains she boiled, and made a cake with the little ones, adding the suitable condiments. She gave the gruel with its condiments to the Great Being; he no sooner took a mouthful of it than he felt its choice flavour thrill through him: nevertheless to test her he said: &ldquo;Madam, if you don&rsquo;t know how to cook why did you spoil my rice?&rdquo; and spat it out on the ground. But she was not angry; only gave him the cake, saying: &ldquo;If the gruel is not good eat the cake.&rdquo; He did the same with that, and again rejecting the boiled rice, said: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know how to cook why did you waste my property?&rdquo; As though angry he mixed all three together and smeared them all over her body from the head downwards, and told her to sit at the door. &ldquo;Very good, master,&rdquo; she said, not angry at all, and did so. Finding that there was no pride in her he said: &ldquo;Come here, madam.&rdquo; At the first word she came.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">When the Great Being came, he had brought with him a thousand rupees and a dress in his betel-nut bag. Now he took out this dress and placed it in her hands, saying: &ldquo;Madam, bathe with your companions and put on this dress and come to me.&rdquo; She did so. The sage gave her parents all the money he had brought or earned, and comforted them, and took her back to the town with him. There to test her he made her sit down in the gatekeeper&rsquo;s house, and telling the gatekeeper&rsquo;s wife of his plans, went to his own house. Then he sent for some of his men, and said: &ldquo;I have left a woman in such and such a house; take a thousand pieces of money with you and test her.&rdquo; He gave them the money and sent them</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t11">away. They did as they were bid. She refused, saying: &ldquo;That is not worth the dust on my master&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo; The men came back and told the result. He sent them again, and a third time; and the fourth time he bade them drag her away by force. They did so, and when she saw the Great Being in all his glory she did not know him, but smiled and wept at the same time as she looked at him. He asked her why she did this. She replied, &ldquo;Teacher, I smiled when I beheld your magnificence, and thought that this magnificence was not given you without cause, but for some good deed in a former life: see the fruit of goodness! I thought, and I smiled. But I wept to think that now you would wrong against the property which another watched and tended, and would go to hell: in pity for that I wept.&rdquo; After this test he knew her chastity, and sent her back to the same place. Putting on his tailor&rsquo;s disguise, he went back to her and there spent the night.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Next morning he repaired to the palace and told queen Udumbarā all about it; she informed the king, and adorning Amarā with all kinds of ornaments, and seated her in a great chariot, and with great honour brought her to the Great Being&rsquo;s house, and made a gala day. The king sent the Bodhisatta a gift worth a thousand pieces of money: all the people of the town sent gifts from the doorkeepers onwards. Lady Amarā divided the gifts sent by the king into halves, and sent one portion back to the king; in the same way she divided all the gifts sent to her by the citizens, and returned half, thus winning the hearts of the people. From that time the Great Being lived with her in happiness, and instructed the king in things temporal and spiritual.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Devadatta boasts that the truth lies only with himself, and not with the Buddha. The latter tells how, in a past life, Devadatta had fooled and humiliated a brahmin who gave him help.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the Tree Devatā (Rukkhadevatā),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;You place your trust in this drunken jackal.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[1.255]</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta. The monks had assembled </span><span class="t18">{1.425}</span><span class="t30"> in the Dhamma Hall and were telling how Devadatta had gone to Gayāsīsa with five hundred followers, whom he was leading into error by declaring that the Dhamma was manifest in him, &ldquo;And not in the ascetic Gotama,&rdquo; and how by his lies he was breaking up the Saṅgha; and how he kept two fast-days a week. And as they sat there talking of the wickedness of Devadatta, the Teacher entered and was told the subject of their conversation. &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Devadatta was as great a liar in past times as he is now.&rdquo; So saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a Tree Devatā in a cemetery grove. In those days a festival was proclaimed in Benares, and the people resolved to sacrifice to the Yakkhas. So they strewed fish and meat about courtyards, and streets, and other places, and set out great pots of strong drink. At midnight a jackal came into the town by the sewer, and regaled himself on the meat and liquor. Crawling into some bushes, he was fast asleep when morning dawned. Waking up and seeing it was broad daylight, he knew that he could not make his way back at that hour with safety. So he lay down quietly near the roadside where he could not be seen, till at last he saw a solitary brahmin on his way to rinse his mouth in the tank. Then the jackal thought to himself, &ldquo;Brahmins are a greedy lot. I must so play on his greediness as to get him to carry me out of the city in his waist-cloth under his outer robe.&rdquo; So, with a human voice, he cried, &ldquo;Brahmin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Who calls me?&rdquo; said the brahmin, turning round. &ldquo;I, brahmin.&rdquo; &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have two hundred gold pieces, brahmin; and if you will hide me in your waist-cloth under your outer robe and so get me out of the city without my being seen, you shall have them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Closing with the offer, the greedy brahmin hid the jackal and carried the beast a little way out of the city. &ldquo;What place is this, brahmin?&rdquo; said the jackal. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s such and such a place,&rdquo; said the brahmin. &ldquo;Go on a bit further,&rdquo; said the jackal and kept urging the brahmin on always a little further, till at last the cremation-park was reached. <span class="t18">{1.426}</span> &ldquo;Put me down here,&rdquo; said the jackal; and the brahmin did so. &ldquo;Spread your robe out on the ground, brahmin.&rdquo; And the greedy brahmin did so.<a id="a2605"></a><span class="t18"> [1.256]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;And now dig up this tree by the roots,&rdquo; said he, and while the brahmin was at work he walked on to the robe, and dunged and staled on it in five places &ndash; the four corners and the middle. This done, he made off into the wood.</p>
<p class="p7">Hereon the Bodhisatta, standing in the fork of the tree, uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Saddahāsi siṅgālassa surāpītassa, brāhmaṇa,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sippikānaṁ sataṁ natthi, kuto kaṁsasatā duve ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">You place your trust in this drunken jackal, brahmin, there is not one hundred cowries, how two hundred bronze coins?</span></p>
<p class="p23">And when he had repeated these verses, the Bodhisatta said to the brahmin, &ldquo;Go now and wash your robe and bathe, and go about your business.&rdquo; So saying, he vanished from sight, and the brahmin did as he was bidden, and departed very mortified at having been so tricked.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Devadatta was the jackal of those days, and I the Tree Devatā.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Thoughtful and Thoughtless.&rdquo;</span><a id="a2612"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about two aged elders. After a rainy-season spent in a forest in the country they resolved to seek out the Teacher, and got together provisions for their journey. But they kept putting off their departure day by day, till a month flew by. Then they provided a fresh supply of provisions, and procrastinated till a second month was gone, and a third. When their indolence and sluggishness had lost them three months, they set out and came to Jetavana. Laying aside their bowls and robes in the common-room, they came into the Teacher&rsquo;s presence. The monks remarked on the length of the time since the two had visited the Teacher, and asked the reason. Then </span><span class="t18">{1.427}</span><span class="t30"> they told their story and all the Saṅgha came to know of the laziness of these indolent monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Assembling in the Dhamma Hall the monks talked together of this thing. And the Teacher entered and was told what they were discussing. Being asked whether they were really so indolent, those monks admitted their short-coming. &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in former times, no less than now, they were indolent and reluctant to leave their abode.&rdquo; So saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, there lived in the river of Benares three fishes, named Over-thoughtful [Bahucintī], Thoughtful [Mitacintī], and <a id="a2613"></a><span class="t18">[1.257]</span> Thoughtless [Appacintī]. And they came down-stream from the wild country to where men dwelt. Hereupon Thoughtful said to the other two, &ldquo;This is a dangerous and perilous neighbourhood, where fishermen catch fish with nets, basket-traps, and such like tackle. Let us be off to the wild country again.&rdquo; But so lazy were the other two fishes, and so greedy, that they kept putting off their going from day to day, until they had let three months slip by. Now fishermen cast their nets into the river; and Over-thoughtful and Thoughtless were swimming on ahead in quest of food when in their folly they blindly rushed into the net. Thoughtful, who was behind, observed the net, and saw the fate of the other two.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I must save these lazy fools from death,&rdquo; thought he. So first he dodged round the net, and splashed in the water in front of it like a fish that has broken through and gone up stream; and then doubling back, he splashed about behind it, like a fish that has broken through and gone down stream. Seeing this, the fishermen thought the fish had broken the net and all got away; so they pulled it in by one corner and the two fishes escaped from the net into the open water again. In this way they owed their lives to Thoughtful.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His story told, the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, recited this verse: </span><span class="t18">{1.428}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Bahucintī Appacintī, ubho jāle abajjhare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mitacintī pamocesī, ubho tattha samāgatā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Thoughtful and Thoughtless, both are caught up in the net, Measured Thought frees them, both of them assemble there.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, and the Four Truths expounded, at the close whereof the aged monks gained fruition of the First Path, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;These two monks were then Over-thoughtful and Thoughtless, and I Thoughtful.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one greedy nun receives dainties from a certain quarter of town, and warns the other nuns off from that area, telling them how dangerous it is. One day a ram breaks her leg on the alms round. The Buddha tells how she used to be a bird in the past who employed a similar tactic, and was cut in two.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the elder bird (sakuṇajeṭṭhaka),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;She who gave advice to others.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a nun who gave a warning to others. For we are told that she came of a good Sāvatthi family, but that from the day of her entrance into the Saṅgha she failed of her duty and was filled with a gluttonous spirit; she used to seek alms in quarters of the city unvisited by other nuns. And dainty food was given her there. Now her gluttony made her afraid that other nuns might go there too and take away from her part of the food. Casting about for a device to stop them from going and to keep everything to herself, she warned </span><a id="a2620"></a><span class="t18">[1.258]</span><span class="t30"> the other nuns that it was a dangerous quarter, troubled by a fierce elephant, a fierce horse, and a fierce dog. And she besought them not to go there for alms. Accordingly not a single nun gave so much as a look in that direction.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now one day on her way through this district for alms, as she was hurrying into a house there, a fierce ram butted her with such violence as to break her leg. Up ran the people and set her leg and brought her on a litter to the convent of nuns. And all the nuns tauntingly said her broken leg came of her going where she had warned them not to go.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Not long after the Saṅgha came to hear of this; and one day in the Dhamma Hall </span><span class="t18">{1.429}</span><span class="t30"> the monks spoke of how this nun had got her leg broken by a fierce ram in a quarter of the city against which she had warned the other nuns; and they condemned her conduct. Entering the Hall at this moment, the Teacher asked, and was told, what they were discussing. &ldquo;As now, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so too in a past time she gave warnings which she did not follow herself; and then as now she came to harm.&rdquo; So saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2621"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a bird, and growing up became king of the birds and came to the Himālayas with thousands of birds in his train. During their stay in that place, a certain fierce bird used to go in quest of food along a highway where she found rice, beans, and other grain dropped by passing wagons. Casting about how best to keep the others from coming there too, she addressed them as follows, &ldquo;The highway is full of peril. Along it go elephants and horses, wagons drawn by fierce oxen, and such like dangerous things. And as it is impossible to take wing on the instant, don&rsquo;t go there at all.&rdquo; And because of her warning, the other birds dubbed her Anusāsikā [Warner].</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day when she was feeding along the highway she heard the sound of a carriage coming swiftly along the road, and turned her head to look at it. &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s quite a long way off,&rdquo; thought she and went on as before. Up swift as the wind came the carriage, and before she could rise, the wheel had crushed her and whirled on its way. At the muster, the king marked her absence and ordered search to be made for her. And at last she was found cut in two on the highway and the news was brought to the king. &ldquo;Through not following her own caution to the other birds she has been cut in two,&rdquo; said he, and uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Yā-y-aññam-anusāsati, sayaṁ loluppacārinī,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sāyaṁ vipakkhikā seti hatā cakkena Sāsikā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">She who gave advice to others, lived in a greedy way herself, staying there Sāsikā, with her wings destroyed, was killed by the wheel. </span><span class="t18">{1.430}</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The warning nun was the bird Anusāsikā of those times, and I the king of the birds.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a2630"></a><a id="a2631"></a><a id="a2632"></a><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told at Jetavana concerning a disobedient monk. He was, they say, of gentle birth, and though ordained in the dispensation that leads to safety, was admonished by his well-wishers, masters, teachers, and fellow-students to this effect, &ldquo;Thus must you advance and thus retreat; thus look at or away from objects; thus must the arm be stretched out or drawn back; thus are the inner and outer garment to be worn; thus is the bowl to be held, and when you have received sufficient food to sustain life, after self-examination, thus are you to partake of it, keeping guard over the door of the senses; in eating you are to be moderate and exercise watchfulness; you are to recognize such and such duties towards monks who come to or go from the monastery; these are the fourteen sets of monastic duties, and the eighty great duties to be duly performed; these are the thirteen ascetic practices; all these are to be scrupulously performed.&rdquo; Yet was he disobedient and impatient, and did not receive instruction respectfully, but refused to listen to them, saying: &ldquo;I do not find fault with you. Why do you speak thus to me? I shall know what is for my good, and what is not.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2633"></a><span class="t34">Then the monks, hearing of his disobedience, sat in the Dhamma Hall, telling of his faults. The Teacher came and asked them what it was they were discussing, and sent for the monk and said: &ldquo;Is it true, monk, that you are disobedient?&rdquo; And he confessed that it was so.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher rebuked him in these words, &ldquo;As now, so in former days were you unruly, monk, disregarding the counsels of the wise and good. Wherefore, by a javelin you did die.&rdquo; So saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2634"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into an acrobat&rsquo;s family. When he grew up, he was a very wise fellow, having skill in means. From another acrobat he learned the javelin dance, and with his master used to travel about exhibiting his skill. Now this master of his knew the four javelin dance but not the five; but one day when performing in a certain village, he, being in liquor, had five javelins set up in a row and gave out that he would dance through the lot.</p>
<p class="p7">Said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t manage all five javelins, master. Have one taken away. If you try the five, you will be run through by the fifth and die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know what I can do when I try,&rdquo; said the drunken fellow; and paying no heed to the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s words, he danced through four of the javelins only to impale himself on the fifth like the Bassia flower on its stalk. And there he lay groaning. Said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;This calamity comes of your disregarding the counsels of the wise and good,&rdquo; and he uttered this verse: <span class="t18">{1.431}</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a2648"></a><span class="t34">During one rainy season the two chief disciples, desiring to leave the multitude and to dwell apart, took leave of the Teacher, and went into the kingdom where Kokālika was. They repaired to the residence of Kokālika, and said this to him, &ldquo;Monk Kokālika, since for us it is delightful to dwell with you, and for you to dwell with us, we would abide here three months.&rdquo; &ldquo;How,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;will it be delightful for you to dwell with me?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;If you tell not a soul that the two chief disciples are dwelling here, we shall be happy, and that will be our delight in dwelling with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;And how is it delightful for me to dwell with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;We will teach the Dhamma to you for three months in your home, and we will discourse to you, and that will be your delight in dwelling with us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dwell here, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so long as you will,&rdquo; and he allotted a pleasant residence to them. There they dwelt in the fruition of the Attainments, and no man knew of their dwelling in that place.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When they had thus past the rains they said to him, &ldquo;Monk, now we have dwelt with you, and we will go to visit the Teacher,&rdquo; and asked his leave to go. He agreed, and went with them on the rounds for alms in a village over against the place where they were. After their meal the elders departed from the village. Kokālika leaving them, turned back and said to the people, &ldquo;Lay brethren, you are like brute animals. Here the two chief disciples have been dwelling for three months in the monastery opposite, and you knew nothing of it: now they are gone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did you not tell us, sir?&rdquo; the people asked.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then they took ghee and oil and medicines, raiment and clothes, and approached the elders, saluting them and saying: &ldquo;Pardon us, sirs we knew not you were the chief disciples, we have learned it but today by the words of the venerable monk Kokālika. Pray have compassion on us, and receive these medicines and clothes.&rdquo; Kokālika went after the elders with them, for he thought: &ldquo;The elders are frugal, and content with little; they will not accept these things, and then they will be given to me.&rdquo; But the elders, because the gift was offered at the instigation of a monk, neither accepted the things themselves nor had them given to Kokālika. The lay folk then said: &ldquo;Sirs, if you will not accept these, come here once again to bless us.&rdquo; The elders promised, and proceeded to the Teacher&rsquo;s presence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now Kokālika was angry, because the elders neither accepted those things themselves, nor had them given to him. The elders, however, having remained a short while with the Teacher, each chose five hundred monks as their following, and with these thousand monks went on pilgrimage seeking alms, as far as Kokālika&rsquo;s country. The lay folk came out to meet them, and led them to the same monastery, and showed them great honour day by day.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Great was the store given them of clothes and of medicines. Those monks who went out with the elders dividing the garments gave of them to all the monks which had come, but to Kokālika gave none, neither did the elders give him any. Getting no clothes Kokālika began to abuse and revile the elders, &ldquo;Sāriputta and Moggallāna are full of wicked desire; they would not accept before what was offered them, but these things they do accept. There is no satisfying them, they have no regard for another.&rdquo; But the elders, perceiving that the man was harbouring evil on their account, set out with their followers to depart; nor would they return, not though the people begged them to stay yet a few days longer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2649"></a><span class="t34">Then a young monk said: &ldquo;Where shall the elders stay, laymen? Your own particular elder does not wish them to stay here.&rdquo; Then the people went to Kokālika, and said: &ldquo;Sir, we are told you do not wish the elders to stay here. Go to! Either appease them and bring them back, or away with you and live elsewhere!&rdquo; In fear of the people this man went and made his request to the elders. &ldquo;Go back, monk,&rdquo; answered the elders, &ldquo;we will not return.&rdquo; So he, being unable to prevail upon them, returned to the monastery. Then the lay brethren asked him whether the elders had returned. &ldquo;I could not persuade them to return,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why not, monk?&rdquo; they asked. And then they began to think it must be no good monks would dwell there because the man lived wrong, and they must get rid of him. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;do not stay here; we have nothing here for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2650"></a><span class="t34">Thus dishonoured by them, he took bowl and robe and went to Jetavana. After saluting the Teacher, he said: &ldquo;Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna are full of wicked desire, they are in the power of wicked desires!&rdquo; The Teacher replied, &ldquo;Say not so, Kokālika; let your heart, Kokālika, have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna; learn that they are good monks.&rdquo; Kokālika said: &ldquo;You believe in your two chief disciples, sir; I have seen it with my own eyes; they have wicked desires, they have secrets within them, they are wicked men.&rdquo; So he said thrice (though the Teacher would have stayed him), then rose from his seat, and departed. Even as he went on his way there arose over all his body boils of the size of a mustard seed, which grew and grew to the size of a ripe seed of the wood apple tree, burst, and blood ran all over him. Groaning he fell by the gate of Jetavana, maddened with pain.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">A great cry arose, and reached even to the Brahmā Realm, &ldquo;Kokālika has reviled the two chief disciples!&rdquo; Then his spiritual teacher, the Brahmā Tudu by name, learning the fact, came with the intent of appeasing the elders, and said while poised in the air, &ldquo;Kokālika, a cruel thing this you have done; make your peace with the chief disciples.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are you, brother?&rdquo; the man asked. &ldquo;Tudu Brahmā, is my name,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Have you not been declared by the Fortunate One,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;one of those who return not? That word means that such come not back to this earth. You will become a Yakkha upon a dunghill!&rdquo; Thus he upbraided the Mahābrahmā. And as he could not persuade the man to do as he advised, he replied to him, &ldquo;May you be tormented according to your own word.&rdquo; Then he returned to his abode of bliss. And Kokālika after dying was born again in the Lotus Hell. That he had been born there the great and mighty Brahmā told to the Tathāgata, and the Teacher told it to the monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">In the Dhamma Hall the monks talked of the man&rsquo;s wickedness, &ldquo;Monks, they say Kokālika reviled Sāriputta and Moggallāna, and by the words of his own mouth came to the Lotus Hell.&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and said he, &ldquo;What speak you of, monks, as you sit here?&rdquo; They told him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Said the Teacher, &ldquo;As now, monks, so likewise in former times, Kokālika&rsquo;s tongue has worked his destruction.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a brahmin in the north country. When he grew up, he received a complete education at Taxila, and, renouncing sensual desire, gave up the world to become an ascetic. He won the five Super Knowledges and eight Attainments, and all the recluses of the Himālayas to the number of five hundred assembled together and followed him as their master. Absorption was his as he dwelt amid his disciples in the Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">In those days there was an ascetic suffering from jaundice who was chopping wood with an axe. And a chattering monk came and sat by him, and directed his work, bidding him give here a chop and there a chop, <span class="t18">{1.432}</span> till the jaundiced ascetic lost his temper. In a rage he cried, &ldquo;Who are you to teach me how to chop wood?&rdquo; and lifting up his keen-edged axe stretched the other dead with a single blow. And the Bodhisatta had the body buried.</p>
<p class="p7">Now on an ant-hill nearby the hermitage there dwelt a partridge which early and late was always piping on the top of the ant-hill. Recognising the note of a partridge, a sportsman killed the bird and took it off with him. Missing the bird&rsquo;s note, the Bodhisatta asked the ascetics why they did not hear their neighbour the partridge now. Then they told him what had happened, and he linked the two events together in this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Accuggatātibalatā ativelaṁ pabhāsitā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vācā hanati dummedhaṁ, tittiraṁ vātivassitan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Talking excessively, and much too strongly, and for much too long, by words the unintelligent was killed, like the noisy partridge.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Having developed within himself the four Divine Abidings, the Bodhisatta thus became destined to rebirth in the Brahmā Realm.<a id="a2651"></a><span class="t18"> [1.261]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Monks, as now, so likewise in former days Kokālika&rsquo;s tongue has worked his destruction.&rdquo; And at the close of this lesson he identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Kokālika was the meddling ascetic of those days, my followers the band of ascetics, and I their master.&rdquo;</span></p>

This Uttaraseṭṭhi is said to have been a very rich man of Sāvatthi, and his wife became the mother of a righteous being from the realm of Brahmā angels, who grew up as lovely as Brahmā. </span><span class="t18">{1.433}</span><span class="t30"> Now one day when the Kattikā [Autumn] festival had been proclaimed in Sāvatthi, the whole city gave itself up to the festivities. His companions, sons of other rich men, had all got wives, but Uttaraseṭṭhi&rsquo;s son had lived so long in the Brahmā Realm that he was purged from passion. His companions plotted together to get him too a sweetheart and make him keep the feast with them. So going to him they said: &ldquo;Dear friend, it is the great feast of Kattikā. Can&rsquo;t we get a sweetheart for you too, and have a good time together?&rdquo; At last his friends picked out a charming girl and decked her out, and left her at his house, with directions to make her way to his chamber. But when she entered the room, not a look or a word did she get from the young merchant. Piqued at this slight to her beauty, she put forth all her graces and feminine blandishments, smiling meantime so as just to show her pretty teeth. The sight of her teeth suggested bones, and his mind was filled with the idea of bones, till the girl&rsquo;s whole body seemed to him nothing but a chain of bones. Then he gave her money and bade her begone. But as she came out of the house a nobleman saw her in the street and gave her a present to accompany him home.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At the end of seven days the festival was over, and the girl&rsquo;s mother, seeing her daughter did not come back, went to the young merchant&rsquo;s friends and asked where she was, and they in turn asked the young merchant. And he said he had paid her and sent her packing as soon as he saw her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the girl&rsquo;s mother insisted on having her daughter restored to her, and brought the young man before the king, who proceeded to examine into the matter. In answer to the king&rsquo;s questions, the young man admitted that the girl had been passed on to him, but said he had no knowledge of her whereabouts, and no means of producing her. Then said the king, &ldquo;If he fails to produce the girl, execute him.&rdquo; So the young man was forthwith hauled off with his hands tied behind his back to be executed, and the whole city was in an uproar at the news. With hands laid on their breasts the people followed after him with lamentations, saying: &ldquo;What means this, sir? You suffer unjustly.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then thought the young man </span><span class="t18">{1.434}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;All this sorrow has befallen me because I was living a lay life. If I can only escape this danger, I will give up the world and join the Saṅgha of the great Gotama, the Fully Awakened One.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now the girl herself heard the uproar and asked what it meant. Being told, she ran swiftly out, crying, &ldquo;Stand aside, sirs! Let me pass! Let the king&rsquo;s men see me.&rdquo; As soon as she had thus shown herself, she was handed over to her mother by the king&rsquo;s men, who set the young man free and went their way.</span><a id="a2659"></a><span class="t18"> [1.262]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Surrounded by his friends, the son of Uttaraseṭṭhi went down to the river and bathed. Returning home, he breakfasted and let his parents know his resolve to give up the world. Then taking cloth for his ascetic&rsquo;s robe, and followed by a great crowd, he sought out the Teacher and with due salutation asked to be admitted to the Saṅgha. A novice first, and afterwards a full monk, he meditated on the idea of Bondage till he gained Insight, and not long afterwards became an Arahat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now one day in the Dhamma Hall the assembled monks talked of his virtues, recalling how in the hour of danger he had recognized the excellence of the dispensation, and, wisely resolving to give up the world for its sake, had won that highest fruit which is Arahatship. And as they talked, the Teacher entered, and, on his asking, was told what was the subject of their conversation. Whereon he declared to them that, like the son of Uttaraseṭṭhi, the wise of former times, by taking thought in the hour of peril, had escaped death. So saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta by change of existence was born a quail. Now in those days there was a quail-catcher who used to catch numbers of these birds in the forest and take them home to fatten. When they were fat, he used to sell them to people and so make a living. And one day he caught the Bodhisatta and brought him home with a number of other quails. Thought the Bodhisatta to himself, &ldquo;If I take the food and drink he gives me, I shall be sold; while if I don&rsquo;t eat it, I shall get so thin, that people will notice it and pass me over, with the result that I shall be safe. This, then, is what I must do.&rdquo; So he fasted and fasted till he got so thin that he was nothing but skin and bone, and not a soul would have him at any price.</p>
<p class="p7">Having disposed <span class="t18">{1.435}</span> of every one of his birds except the Bodhisatta, the bird-catcher took the Bodhisatta out of the cage and laid him on the palms of his hand to see what ailed the bird. Watching when the man was off his guard, the Bodhisatta spread his wings and flew off to the forest. Seeing him return, the other quails asked what had become of him so long, and where he had been. Then he told them he had been caught by a fowler, and, being asked how he had escaped, replied, that it was by a device he had thought of, namely, not to take either the food or the drink which the fowler supplied. So saying, he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Nācintayanto puriso visesam-adhigacchati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cintitassa phalaṁ passa: muttosmi&rsquo; vadhabandhanā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">The unthinking person does not attain a distinction, but look at the fruit of the thoughtful one: I am free from bondage and death.</span></p>
<p class="p23">In this manner did the Bodhisatta speak of what he had done.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;I was the quail that escaped death in those days.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one young man is talkative at all times, which brings him the blame of his fellow monks. The Buddha tells how, in a past life, he had been a cock who crowed at all the wrong times, which brought about his destruction.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;No mother and father raised him.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [1.263]</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a monk who used to be noisy at the wrong time. He is said to have come of a good Sāvatthi family and to have given up the world for the dispensation, but to have neglected his duties and despised instruction. He never took count of the hours for duties, for ministry or for reciting the texts. Throughout the three watches of the night, as well as the hours of waking, he was never quiet; so that the other monks could not get a wink of sleep.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Accordingly, the monks in the Dhamma Hall censured his conduct. Entering the Hall and learning on enquiry what they were talking about, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, as now, so in past times, this monk was noisy out of season, and for his unseasonable conduct was strangled.&rdquo; So saying he told this story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{1.436}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2667"></a><a id="a2668"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a northern brahmin family, and when he grew up, learned all knowledge and became a teacher of world-wide fame with five hundred young brahmins studying under him. Now these young brahmins had a cock who crowed betimes and roused them to their studies. And this cock died. So they looked all about for another, and one of their number, when picking up firewood in the cemetery-grove, saw a cock there which he brought home and kept in a coop. But, as this second cock had been bred in a cemetery, he had no knowledge of times and seasons, and used to crow casually &ndash; at midnight as well as at daybreak. Roused by his crowing at midnight, the young brahmins fell to their studies; by dawn they were tired out and could not for sleepiness keep their attention on the subject; and when he fell crowing in broad day they did not get a chance of quiet for repeating their lesson. And as it was the cock&rsquo;s crowing both at midnight and by day which had brought their studies to a standstill, they took the bird and wrung his neck. Then they told their teacher that they had killed the cock that crowed in and out of season.</p>
<p class="p7">Said their teacher, for their edification, &ldquo;It was his bad upbringing that brought this cock to his end.&rdquo; So saying, he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a2669"></a><a id="a2670"></a><a id="a2671"></a><span class="t12">1. Amātāpitarasaṁvaddho, anācerakule vasaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a2672"></a><span class="t12">Nāyaṁ kālaṁ akālaṁ vā, abhijānāti kukkuṭo ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a2673"></a><a id="a2674"></a><a id="a2675"></a><a id="a2676"></a><span class="t4">No mother and father raised him, not under a teacher&rsquo;s influence, neither at the right or wrong time, did the cock know when to call out. </span><a id="a2677"></a><span class="t18">[1.264]</span></p>
<p class="p23">Such was the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s teaching on the matter; and when he had lived his allotted time on earth, he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka as follows, &ldquo;This monk was the cock of those times, who did not know when not to crow; my disciples were the young brahmins; and I their teacher.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a2689"></a><a id="a2690"></a><span class="t34">When the One with Ten Powers first attained supreme wisdom, after disciples had multiplied, and innumerable gods and men had been born into heavenly states, and the seeds of goodness had been cast abroad, great honour was shown him, and great gifts given. The heretics were like fireflies after sunrise; they had no honours and no gifts; in the street they stood, and cried out to the people, &ldquo;What is the ascetic Gotama the Buddha? We are Buddhas also! Does that gift only bring great fruit, which is given to him? That which is given to us also has great fruit for you! Give to us also, work for us!&rdquo; But cry as they would, they got no honour nor gifts. Then they came together in secret, and consulted, &ldquo;How can we cast a stain upon Gotama the ascetic in the face of men, and put an end to his honour and his gifts?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2691"></a><span class="t34">Now there was at that time in Sāvatthi a certain nun, named Ciñcamāṇavikā; she was very lovely, full of all grace, like a Devaccharā; rays of brilliancy shone forth from her body. Some one uttered a counsel of cruelty thus, &ldquo;By the help of Ciñcamāṇavikā we will cast a stain upon the ascetic Gotama, and put an end to his honour and the gifts he receives.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they all agreed, &ldquo;that is the way to do it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2692"></a><a id="a2693"></a><span class="t34">She came to the monastery of the heretics, and greeted them, and stood still. The heretics said nothing to her. She said: &ldquo;What blemish is there in me? Three times I have greeted you!&rdquo; She said again, &ldquo;Sirs, what blemish is in me? why do you not speak to me?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;Know you not, sister, that Gotama the ascetic is going about and doing us harm, cutting off all the honour and liberality that was shown us?&rdquo; &ldquo;I did not know it, sirs; but what can I do?&rdquo; &ldquo;If you wish us well, sister by your own doing bring a stain upon the ascetic Gotama, and put an end to his honour and the gifts he receives.&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;Very good, sirs, leave that to me; do not trouble about it.&rdquo; With these words she departed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">After that, she used all a woman&rsquo;s skill in deceit. When the people of Sāvatthi had heard the Dhamma, and were coming away from Jetavana, she used to go towards Jetavana, clad in a robe dyed with cochineal, and with fragrant garlands in her hands. When any one asked her, &ldquo;Whither away at this hour?&rdquo; she would reply, &ldquo;What have you to do with my goings and comings?&rdquo; She spent the night in the heretics&rsquo; monastery, which was close by Jetavana: and when early in the morning, the lay associates of the order came forth from the city to pay their morning salutation, she would meet them as though she had spent the night in Jetavana, going towards the city. If any one asked where she had stayed, she would answer, &ldquo;What are my stayings and lodgings to you?&rdquo; But after some six weeks, she replied, &ldquo;I spent the night in Jetavana, with Gotama the ascetic, in one fragrant cell.&rdquo; Then the unconverted began to wonder, could this be true, or not.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">After three or four months, she bound bandages about her belly, and made it appear as though she were with child, and wrapped a red robe around her. Then she declared that she was with child by the ascetic Gotama, and made blind fools believe. After eight or nine months, she fastened about her pieces of wood in a bundle, and over all her</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t34">red robe; hands, feet, and back she caused to be beaten with the jawbone of an ox, so as to produce swellings; and made as though all her senses were wearied.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2694"></a><span class="t34">One evening, when the Tathāgata was sitting on the splendid seat of preaching, and was preaching the Dhamma, she went among the Saṅgha, and standing in front of the Tathāgata, said: &ldquo;O great ascetic! You preach indeed to great multitudes; sweet is your voice, and soft is the lip that covers your teeth; but you have got me with child, and my time is near; yet you assign me no chamber for the childbirth, you give me no ghee nor oil; what you will not do yourself, you do not ask another of the lay associates to do, the king of Kosala, or Anāthapiṇḍika, or Visākhā the great lay sister. Why do you not tell one of them to do what is to be done for me? You know how to take your pleasure, but you do not know how to care for that which shall be born!&rdquo; So she reviled the Tathāgata in the midst of the Saṅgha, as one might try to besmirch the moon&rsquo;s face with a handful of filth. The Tathāgata stopped his discourse, and roaring like a lion in clarion tones, he said: &ldquo;Sister, whether that which you have said be true or false, you know and I only know.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, truly,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;this happened through something that you and I only know of.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Just at that moment, Sakka&rsquo;s throne became hot. Reflecting, he perceived the reason, &ldquo;Ciñcamāṇavikā is accusing the Tathāgata of what is not true.&rdquo; Determined to clear up this matter, he came there with four Devaputtas in his company. The Devaputtas took on them the shape of mice, and all at once gnawed through the cords that bound the bundle of wood: a wind-puff blew up the robe she wore, and the bundle of wood was disclosed and fell at her feet: the toes of both her feet were cut off. The people cried out, &ldquo;A wretch is accusing the Supreme Buddha!&rdquo; They spat on her head, and drove her forth from Jetavana with staves and clods in their hands. And as she passed beyond the range of the Tathāgata&rsquo;s vision, the great earth yawned and showed a huge cleft, flames came up from the lowest hell, and she, enveloped in it as it were with a garment which her friends should wrap about her, fell to the lowest hell and there was born again. The honour and receipts of the other heretics ceased, those of the One with Ten Powers grew more abundantly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Next day they were conversing in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Monks, Ciñcamāṇavikā falsely accused the Supreme Buddha, great in virtue, worthy of all gifts! And she came to dire destruction.&rdquo; The Teacher entered, and asked what they talked of, sitting there together. They told him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On this occasion the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time Ciñcā has laid false accusations against me. She did the like in other times.&rdquo; So saying he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into the family priest&rsquo;s family, and on his father&rsquo;s death became the family priest.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the king promised to grant whatsoever boon his queen should ask of him, and she said: &ldquo;The boon I ask is an easy one; henceforth you must not look on any other woman with eyes of love.&rdquo; At first he refused, but, wearied by her unceasing importunity, was obliged to give way at last. And from that day forward he never cast a glance of love at any one of his sixteen thousand dancing girls.</p>
<p class="p7">Now a disturbance arose on the borders of his kingdom, and after two or three engagements with the robbers, the troops there sent a letter to the king saying that they were unable to carry the matter through. Then the king was anxious to go in person and assembled a mighty host. And he said to his wife, &ldquo;Dear one, I go to the frontier, where battles will rage ending in victory or defeat. The camp is no place for a woman, and you must stay behind here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2695"></a>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remain behind if you go, my lord,&rdquo; said she. But finding the king firm in his decision she made the following request instead, &ldquo;Every league, <a id="a2696"></a><span class="t18">[1.265]</span> send a messenger to enquire how I fare.&rdquo; And the king promised to do so. Accordingly, when he marched out with his host, leaving the Bodhisatta in the city, the king sent back a messenger at the end of every league to let the queen know how he was, and to find out how she fared. Of each man as he came she asked what brought him back. And on receiving the answer that he was come to learn how she fared, they queen beckoned the messenger to her and did wrong with him. Now the king journeyed two and thirty leagues and sent two and thirty messengers, <span class="t18">{1.438}</span> and the queen did wrong with them all. And when he had pacified the frontier, to the great joy of the inhabitants, he started on his homeward journey, dispatching a second series of thirty-two messengers. And the queen misbehaved with each one of these, as before.</p>
<p class="p7">Halting his victorious army near the city, the king sent a letter to the Bodhisatta to prepare the city for his entry. The preparations in the city were done, and the Bodhisatta was preparing the palace for the king&rsquo;s arrival, when he came to the queen&rsquo;s apartments. The sight of his great beauty so moved the queen that she called to him to satisfy her lust. But the Bodhisatta pleaded with her, urging the king&rsquo;s honour, and protesting that he shrank from all wrong and would not do as she wished. &ldquo;No thoughts of the king frightened sixty-four of the king&rsquo;s messengers,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and will you for the king&rsquo;s sake fear to do my will?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Had these messengers thought with me, they would not have acted thus. As for me that know the right, I will not commit this wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;If you refuse, I will have your head chopped off.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;So be it. Cut off my head in this or in a hundred thousand existences; yet will I not do your bidding.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;All right; I will see,&rdquo; said the queen menacingly. And retiring to her chamber, she scratched herself, put oil on her limbs, clad herself in dirty clothes and feigned to be ill. Then she sent for her slaves and bade them tell the king, when he should ask after her, that she was ill.</p>
<p class="p7">Meantime the Bodhisatta had gone to meet the king, who, after marching round the city in solemn procession, entered his palace. Not seeing the queen, he asked where she was, and was told that she was ill. Entering the royal bed-chamber, the king caressed the queen and asked what ailed her. She was silent; but when the king asked the third time, she looked at him and said: &ldquo;Though my lord the king still lives, yet poor women like me have to own a master.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;The family priest whom you left to watch over the city came here on pretence of seeing after the palace; and because I would not yield to his will, <span class="t18">{1.439}</span> he beat me to his heart&rsquo;s content and went off.&rdquo;<a id="a2697"></a><span class="t18"> [1.266]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Then the king fumed with rage, like the crackling of salt or sugar in the fire; and he rushed from the chamber. Calling his servants, he bade them bind the family priest with his hands behind him, like one condemned to death, and cut off his head at the place of execution. So away they hurried and bound the Bodhisatta. And the drum was beaten to announce the execution.</p>
<p class="p7">Thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Doubtless that wicked queen has already poisoned the king&rsquo;s mind against me, and now must I save myself from this peril.&rdquo; So he said to his captors, &ldquo;Bring me into the king&rsquo;s presence before you slay me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;Because, as the king&rsquo;s servant, I have toiled greatly on the king&rsquo;s business, and know where great treasures are hidden which I have discovered. If I am not brought before the king, all this wealth will be lost. So lead me to him, and then do your duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Accordingly, they brought him before the king, who asked why reverence had not restrained him from such wickedness.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2698"></a>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; answered the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;I was born a brahmin, and have never taken the life so much as of an emmet or ant. I have never taken what was not my own, even to a blade of grass. Never have I looked with lustful eyes upon another man&rsquo;s wife. Not even in jest have I spoken falsely, and not a drop of strong drink have I ever drunk. Innocent am I, sire; but that wicked woman took me lustfully by the hand, and, being rebuffed, threatened me, nor did she retire to her chamber before she had told me her secret evil-doing. For there were sixty-four messengers who came with letters from you to the queen. Send for these men and ask each whether he did as the queen bade him or not.&rdquo; Then the king had the sixty-four men bound and sent for the queen. And she confessed to having had guilty intercourse with the men. Then the king ordered off all the sixty-four to be beheaded.</p>
<p class="p7">But at this point <span class="t18">{1.440}</span> the Bodhisatta cried out, &ldquo;Nay, sire, the men are not to blame; for they were constrained by the queen. Wherefore pardon them. And as for the queen: she is not to blame, for the passions of women are insatiate, and she does but act according to her inborn nature. Wherefore, pardon her also, O king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Upon this entreaty the king was merciful, and so the Bodhisatta saved the lives of the queen and the sixty-four men, and he gave them each a place to dwell in. Then the Bodhisatta came to the king and said: &ldquo;Sire, the baseless accusations of folly put the wise in unmerited bonds, but the words of the wise released the foolish. Thus folly wrongfully binds, and wisdom sets free from bonds.&rdquo; So saying, he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Abaddhā tattha bajjhanti, yattha bālā pabhāsare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Baddhā pi tattha muccanti, yattha dhīrā pabhāsare ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">They bind the unbound right there, where fools speak, they free the bound right there, where the wise speak. </span><a id="a2699"></a><span class="t18">[1.267]</span></p>
<p class="p23">When he had taught the king the Dhamma in these verses, he exclaimed, &ldquo;All this trouble sprang from my living a lay life. I must change my mode of life, and crave your permission, sire, to give up the world.&rdquo; And with the king&rsquo;s permission he gave up the world and quit his tearful relations and his great wealth to become a recluse. His dwelling was in the Himālayas, and there he won the Super Knowledges and Attainments and became destined to rebirth in the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His teaching ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Ciñcā was the wicked queen of those days, Ānanda the king, and I his family priest.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;The one the same.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{1.441}</span><a id="a2709"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about Anāthapiṇḍika&rsquo;s true friend. For his acquaintances and friends and relations came to him and tried hard to stop his intimacy with a certain man, saying that neither in birth nor wealth was he Anāthapiṇḍika&rsquo;s equal. But the great merchant replied that friendship should not depend on equality or inequality of externals. And when he went off to his village headmany, he put this friend in charge of his wealth. Everything came to pass as in the Kālakaṇṇijātaka [Ja 83].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2710"></a><span class="t34">Tradition says that the two had made mud-pies together, and had gone to the same school; but, as years went by, the friend, whose name was Wretch [Kāḷakaṇṇī], sank into great distress and could not make a living anyhow. So he came to the rich man, who was kind to him, and paid him to look after all his property; and the poor friend was employed under Anāthapiṇḍika and did all his business for him. After he had gone up to the rich man&rsquo;s it was a common thing to hear in the house, &ldquo;Stand up, Wretch,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Sit down, Wretch,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Have your dinner, Wretch.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">One day the Treasurer&rsquo;s friends and acquaintances called on him and said: &ldquo;Lord Treasurer, don&rsquo;t let this sort of thing go on in your house. It&rsquo;s enough to scare a Yakkha to hear such ill-omened observations as &ndash; &lsquo;Stand up, Wretch,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sit down, Wretch,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Have your dinner, Wretch.&rsquo; The man is not your social equal; he&rsquo;s a miserable wretch, dogged by misfortune. Why have anything to do with him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; replied Anāthapiṇḍika, &ldquo;a name only serves to denote a man, and the wise do not measure a man by his name; nor is it proper to wax superstitious about mere sounds. Never will I throw over, for his mere name&rsquo;s sake, the friend with whom I made mud-pies as a child.&rdquo; And he rejected their advice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">One day the great man departed to visit a village of which he was headman, leaving the other in charge of the house. Hearing of his departure certain robbers made up their mind to break into the house; and, arming themselves to the teeth, they surrounded it in the night-time. But Wretch had a suspicion that burglars might be expected, and was sitting up for them. And when he knew that they had come, he ran about as if to rouse his people, bidding one sound the conch, another beat the drum, till he had the whole house full of noise, as though be were rousing a whole army of servants. Said the robbers, &ldquo;The house is not so empty as we were told; the master must be at home.&rdquo; Flinging away their stones, clubs and other weapons, away they bolted for their lives.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Next day great alarm was caused by the sight of all the discarded weapons lying round the house; and Wretch was lauded to the skies by such praises as this, &ldquo;If the house had not been patrolled by one so wise as this man, the robbers would have simply walked in at their own pleasure and have plundered the house. The Treasurer owes this stroke of good luck to his staunch friend.&rdquo; And the moment the merchant came back from his village they hastened to tell him the whole story. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is the trusty guardian of my house whom you wanted me to get rid of. If I had taken your advice and got rid of him; I should be a beggar today. It&rsquo;s not the name but the heart within that makes the man.&rdquo; So saying he raised his wages. And thinking that here was a good story to tell, off he went to the Teacher and gave him a complete account of it all, right through.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">But, when in this case Anāthapiṇḍika related the danger his house had been in, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Layman, a friend rightly so-called is never inferior. The standard is ability to befriend. A friend rightly so-called, though only equal or inferior to one&rsquo;s self, should be held a superior, for all such friends fail not to grapple with trouble which befalls one&rsquo;s self. It is your real friend that has now saved you your wealth. So in days gone by a like real friend saved a Devatā&rsquo;s mansion.&rdquo; Then at Anāthapiṇḍika&rsquo;s request, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a Devatā in the king&rsquo;s pleasure gardens, and dwelt in a clump of kusa grass. Now in the same grounds near the king&rsquo;s seat there grew a beautiful Wishing Tree (also called the Mukkhaka) with straight stem and spreading branches, which received great favour from the king. Here dwelt one who had been a mighty king of the Devas and had been reborn a Tree Devatā. And the Bodhisatta was on terms of intimate friendship with this Tree Devatā.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the king&rsquo;s dwelling had only one pillar to support the roof <a id="a2711"></a><span class="t18">[1.268]</span> and that pillar grew shaky. Being told of this, the king sent for carpenters and ordered them to put in a sound pillar and make it secure. So the carpenters <span class="t18">{1.442}</span> looked about for a tree that would do and, not finding one elsewhere, went to the pleasure gardens and saw the Mukkhaka. Then away they went back to the king. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have you found a tree that will do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;but we don&rsquo;t like to fell it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the king. Then they told him how they had in vain looked everywhere for a tree and did not dare to cut down the sacred tree. &ldquo;Go and cut it down,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and make the roof secure. I will look out for another tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So they went away. And they took a sacrifice to the pleasure gardens and offered it to the tree, saying among themselves that they would come and cut it down next day. Hearing their words, the Tree Devatā knew that her home would be destroyed on the morrow, and burst into tears as she clasped her children to her breast, not knowing whither to fly with them. Her friends, the spirits of the forest, came and asked what the matter was. But not one of them could devise how to stay the carpenters&rsquo; hand, and all embraced her with tears and lamentations. At this moment up came the Bodhisatta to call upon the Tree Devatā and was told the news. &ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta cheerfully. &ldquo;I will see that the tree is not cut down. Only wait and see what I will do when the carpenters come tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Next day when the men came, the Bodhisatta, assuming the shape of a chameleon, was at the tree before they were, and got in at the roots and worked his way up till he got out among the branches, making the tree look full of holes. Then the Bodhisatta rested among the boughs with his head rapidly moving to and fro. Up came the carpenters; and at sight of the chameleon their leader struck the tree with his hand, and exclaimed that the tree was rotten and that they didn&rsquo;t look carefully before making their offerings the day before. And off he went full of scorn for the great strong tree.</p>
<p class="p7">In this way the Bodhisatta saved the Tree Devatā&rsquo;s home. And when all her friends <span class="t18">{1.443}</span> and acquaintances came to see her, she joyfully sang the praises of the Bodhisatta, as the saviour of her home, saying: &ldquo;Devatās of the Trees, for all our mighty power we knew not what to do; while a humble Kusa Devatā had wit to save my home for me. Truly we should choose our friends without considering whether they are superiors, equals, or inferiors, making no distinction of rank. For each according to his strength can help a friend in the hour of need.&rdquo; And she repeated this verse about friendship and its duties:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Kare sarikkho, atha vā pi seṭṭho,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nihīnako vā pi, kareyya mitto,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kareyyum-ete byasane uttamatthaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yathā ahaṁ Kusanāḷī rucāyan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">The one the same, and then the one greater, and the one lower, let him make a friend, they should give utmost help to unfortunates, like I, Kusanāḷi, did to this tree. </span><a id="a2712"></a><span class="t18">[1.269]</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus did she teach the assembled Devas, adding these words, &ldquo;Wherefore, such as would escape from an evil plight must not merely consider whether a man is an equal or a superior, but must make friends of the wise whatsoever their station in life.&rdquo; And she lived her life and with the Kusa Devatā finally passed away to fare according to her deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended the Teacher identified the birth by saying: &ldquo;Ānanda was then the Tree Devatā, and I the Kusa Devatā.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present when Devadatta hears the Buddha being praised he is maddened by it. The Buddha tells how, when he was a state elephant in the past, a previous incarnation of Devadatta had been jealous of him, and had tried to get him killed, until he fled to another king, who was more appreciative.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the elephant (hatthī),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;When a foolish one receives fame.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{1.444}</span><a id="a2718"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta. For the monks had met together in the Dhamma Hall, and were talking of how the sight of the Tathāgata&rsquo;s perfections and all the distinctive signs of Buddhahood</span><a id="a2719"></a><a href="notes.html#a14931"><span class="t9">{340}</span></a><span class="t30"> maddened Devadatta; and how in his jealousy he could not bear to hear the praises of the Buddha&rsquo;s utter wisdom. Entering the Hall, the Teacher asked what was the subject of their conversation. And when they told him, he said: &ldquo;Monks, as now, so in former times Devadatta was maddened by hearing my praises.&rdquo; So saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2720"></a>In the past when king Magadha was ruling in Rājagaha in Magadha, the Bodhisatta was born an elephant. He was white all over and graced with all the beauty of form described above.<a id="a2721"></a><a href="notes.html#a14933"><span class="t9">{341}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2722"></a><span class="t11">When born, he was white all over, like a mighty mass of silver. Like diamond balls were his eyes, like a manifestation of the five brightnesses; red was his mouth, like scarlet cloth; like silver flecked with red gold was his trunk; and his four feet were as if polished with lac. Thus his person, adorned with the Ten Perfections, was of consummate beauty.</span></p>
<p class="p7">And because of his beauty the king made him his state elephant. One festal day the king adorned the city like a city of the Devas and, mounted on the elephant in all its trappings, made a solemn procession round the city attended by a great retinue. And all along the route the people were moved by the sight of that peerless elephant to exclaim, &ldquo;Oh what a stately gait! What proportions! What beauty! What grace! Such a white elephant is worthy of a Universal Monarch.&rdquo; All this praise of his <a id="a2723"></a><span class="t18">[1.270]</span> elephant awoke the king&rsquo;s jealousy and he resolved to have it cast over a precipice and killed. So he summoned the mahout and asked whether he called that a trained elephant.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Indeed he is well trained, sire,&rdquo; said the mahout. &ldquo;No, he is very badly trained.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, he is well trained.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{1.445}</span> &ldquo;If he is so well trained, can you get him to climb to the summit of Mount Vepulla?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Away with you, then,&rdquo; said the king. And he got down from the elephant, making the mahout mount instead, and went himself to the foot of the mountain, while the mahout rode on the elephant&rsquo;s back up to the top of Mount Vepulla. The king with his courtiers also climbed the mountain, and had the elephant halted at the brink of a precipice. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he to the man, &ldquo;if he is so well trained as you say, make him stand on three legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And the mahout on the elephant&rsquo;s back just touched the animal with his goad by way of sign and called to him, &ldquo;Hi! My beauty, stand on three legs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now make him stand on his two fore-legs,&rdquo; said the king. And the Great Being raised his hind-legs and stood on his fore-legs alone. &ldquo;Now on the hind-legs,&rdquo; said the king, and the obedient elephant raised his fore-legs till he stood on his hind-legs alone. &ldquo;Now on one leg,&rdquo; said the king, and the elephant stood on one leg.</p>
<p class="p7">Seeing that the elephant did not fall over the precipice, the king cried, &ldquo;Now if you can, make him stand in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then thought the mahout to himself, &ldquo;All Jambudīpa cannot show the match of this elephant for excellence of training. Surely the king must want to make him tumble over the precipice and meet his death.&rdquo; So he whispered in the elephant&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;My son, the king wants you to fall over and get killed. He is not worthy of you. If you have power to journey through the air, rise up with me upon your back and fly through the air to Benares.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And the Great Being, endowed as he was with the marvellous powers which flow from merit, straightaway rose up into the air. Then said the mahout, &ldquo;Sire, this elephant, possessed as he is with the marvellous powers which flow from merit, is too good for such a worthless fool as you: none but a wise and good king is worthy to be his master. When those who are so worthless as you get an elephant like this, they don&rsquo;t know his value, and so they lose their elephant, and all the rest of their glory and splendour.&rdquo; So saying the mahout, seated on the elephant&rsquo;s neck, recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Yasaṁ laddhāna dummedho, anatthaṁ carati attano,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Attano ca paresañ-ca hiṁsāya paṭipajjatī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">When a foolish one receives fame, it&rsquo;s not at all for his welfare, he practices in a way harmful for himself and for others. </span><span class="t18">{1.446}</span></p>
<p class="p23">&ldquo;And now, goodbye,&rdquo; said he to the king as he ended this rebuke; and rising in the air, he passed to Benares and halted in mid-air <a id="a2724"></a><span class="t18">[1.271]</span> over the royal courtyard. And there was a great stir in the city and all cried out, &ldquo;Look at the state-elephant that has come through the air for our king and is hovering over the royal courtyard.&rdquo; And with all haste the news was conveyed to the king too, who came out and said: &ldquo;If your coming is for my benefit, alight on the earth.&rdquo; And the Bodhisatta descended from the air. Then the mahout got down and bowed before the king, and in answer to the king&rsquo;s enquiries told the whole story of their leaving Rājagaha. &ldquo;It was very good of you,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;to come here,&rdquo; and in his joy he had the city decorated and the elephant installed in his state-stable. Then he divided his kingdom into three portions, and made over one to the Bodhisatta, one to the mahout, and one he kept himself. And his power grew from the day of the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s coming till all Jambudīpa owned his sovereign sway. As emperor of Jambudīpa, he was charitable and did other good works till he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Devadatta was in those days the king of Magadha, Sāriputta the king of Benares, Ānanda the mahout, and I the elephant.&rdquo;</span></p>
