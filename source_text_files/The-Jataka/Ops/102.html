<h4 class="h40"><a id="a12809"></a>The Kuṇāla Bird</h4>
<p class="p7">This is the report and the fame thereof:<a id="a12810"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17065"><span class="t9">{1354}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(1.) A region yielding from its soil all manner of herbs,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(2.) Overspread with many a tangle of flowers,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12811"></a><span class="t12">(3.) Ranged over by the elephant, gayal, buffalo, deer, yak, spotted antelope, rhinoceros, elk, lion, tiger, panther, bear, wolf, hyena, otter,</span><a id="a12812"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17069"><span class="t19">{1355}</span></a><span class="t12"> kadalī antelope, wild cat, long-eared hare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(4.) Inhabited by numberless herds of different kinds of elephants,</span><a id="a12813"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17071"><span class="t12">{1356}</span></a><a id="a12814"></a></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12815"></a><span class="t12">(5.) And frequented by various kinds of deer,</span><a id="a12816"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17073"><span class="t19">{1357}</span></a><span class="t12"> and haunted by Kimpurisas, Yakkhas and Rakkhasas,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12817"></a><span class="t12">(6.) Overspread with a thicket of trees blooming at the top with flowers, stalked and high-standing, and pithless,</span><a id="a12818"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17075"><span class="t19">{1358}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12819"></a><span class="t12">(7.) Re-echoing to the cries of hundreds of birds, all mad with joy, ospreys, partridges, elephant-birds, peacocks, pheasants, Indian cuckoos,</span><a id="a12820"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17077"><span class="t19">{1359}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(8.) Adorned and covered with hundreds of mineral substances,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">collyrium, arsenic, yellow orpiment, vermilion, gold and silver &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p26"><a id="a12821"></a>it was in such a delightful forest lived the bird Kuṇāla: <a id="a12822"></a><span class="t18">{5.417}</span><a id="a12823"></a> very bright was it and covered with bright feathers.<a id="a12824"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17079"><span class="t9">{1360}</span></a></p>
<p class="p18"><a id="a12825"></a><a id="a12826"></a>This Kuṇāla bird had three thousand five hundred hen-birds in attendance on him. Then two birds seizing a stick in their mouths seated the Kuṇāla bird between them and flew up, fearing lest fatigue in the course of the long distance should cause him to move from his position and he should fall. Five hundred young birds fly below, for they thought: &ldquo;If this Kuṇāla bird should fall from his perch, we will catch him in our wings.&rdquo; Another five hundred birds fly above him, for fear lest the heat should scorch Kuṇāla. Five hundred birds fly on either side of him, to prevent cold or heat, grass or dust, wind or dew from coming nigh him. Five hundred fly in front of him, lest cowherds or neat-herds, grass-cutters, or stick-gatherers or foresters should strike Kuṇāla with stick or potsherd, with fist or clod, with staff or knife or gravel, or lest Kuṇāla should come into collision with shrub or creeper or tree, with post or rock, or with some powerful bird. Five hundred fly behind, addressing him with gentle, kindly words, in charming, sweet tones, lest Kuṇāla should grow weary, sitting there. Five hundred birds fly here and there, bringing a variety of fruits from different kinds of trees, lest Kuṇāla should be distressed with hunger.</p>
<p class="p18">Then the birds swiftly transport Kuṇāla for his satisfaction from pleasance to pleasance, from garden to garden, from one river&rsquo;s bank to another, from mountain peak to mountain peak, from one mango grove to another, from Jambu plum orchard to Jambu plum orchard, from one breadfruit grove to another, from one coconut plantation to another. So Kuṇāla day by day escorted by these birds thus upbraids them: <span class="t18">{5.418}</span> &ldquo;Perish, you vile creatures, yes, perish utterly, you thievish, cheating creatures, heedless, flighty and ungrateful as you are, like the wind going wheresoever you list.&rdquo;<span class="t18"> [5.223] {5.419}</span></p>
<p class="p7">After these words the Teacher said: &ldquo;Surely, monks, even when I was in an animal form, I knew well the ingratitude, the wiles, the wickedness and immorality of women-folk, and at that time so far from being in their power I kept them under my control,&rdquo; and when by these words he had removed the spiritual discontent of these monks, the Teacher held his peace.</p>
<p class="p7">At this moment two black cuckoos came to this spot, raising their lord aloft on the stick, while others in fours flew below and on every side of him. On seeing them, the monks asked the Teacher of them and he said: &ldquo;Of old, monks, I had a friend, a royal cuckoo, named Puṇṇamukha, and such was the tradition in his family,&rdquo; and in answer to the monk&rsquo;s question, just as before, he said:<a id="a12827"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17081"><span class="t9">{1361}</span></a></p>
<p class="p27">On the eastern side of this same Himālayas, the king of mountains,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(9.) Are green-flowing streams, having their source in slight and gentle mountain slopes;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(10.) In a fragrant, charming, bright spot, blooming with the beauty of lotuses,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">blue, white, and the hundred-leafed, the white lily and the tree of paradise, </span><span class="t18">{5.420}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12828"></a><span class="t12">(11.) In a region overrun and beautified with all manner of trees</span><a id="a12829"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17083"><span class="t19">{1362}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(12-15.) And flowering shrubs and creepers,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(16.) Resounding with the cries of swans, ducks and geese,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(17.) Inhabited by troops of monks and ascetics, and such as are possessed of magical or Supernormal Powers,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(18.) And haunted by noble Devas, Yakkhas, Rakkhasas, Dānavas, Gandhabbas, Kinnaras and mighty serpents.</span></p>
<p class="p26"><a id="a12830"></a>Verily it was in such a charming forest-thicket that the royal cuckoo Puṇṇamukha dwelt. Very sweet was his voice, and his laughing eyes were as the eyes of one intoxicated with joy. Three thousand five hundred hen-birds followed in the train of this cuckoo Puṇṇamukha. So two birds seizing a stick in their mouths and seating Puṇṇamukha in the middle of it flew up into the air, fearing lest fatigue<a id="a12831"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17085"><span class="t9">{1363}</span></a><a id="a12832"></a> in the course of the long distance should cause him to move from his position and he should fall.</p>
<p class="p18">Fifty young birds fly below, for they thought: &ldquo;If this Kuṇāla bird should fall from his perch, we will catch him in our wings.&rdquo; Another fifty birds fly above him, for fear lest the heat should scorch Kuṇāla. Fifty birds fly on either side of him, to prevent cold or heat, grass or dust, wind or dew from coming nigh him. Fifty fly in front of him, lest cowherds or neat-herds, grass-cutters, or stick-gatherers or foresters should strike Kuṇāla with stick or potsherd, with fist or clod, with staff or knife or gravel, or lest Kuṇāla should come into collision with shrub or creeper or tree, with post or rock, or with some powerful bird. Fifty fly behind, addressing him with gentle, kindly words, <span class="t18">{5.421}</span> in charming, sweet tones, lest Kuṇāla should grow weary, sitting there. Fifty birds fly here and there, bringing a variety of fruits from different kinds of trees, lest Kuṇāla should be distressed with hunger.</p>
<p class="p18">Then did Puṇṇamukha, escorted by these birds by day, thus sing their praises, saying: &ldquo;Bravo, my sisters, this act of yours well becomes high-born ladies, in that you do service to your lord.&rdquo; Then in truth the cuckoo Puṇṇamukha drew near to the place where sat the bird Kuṇāla, and the birds in attendance upon Kuṇāla saw him, and while he was yet afar off they drew near to Puṇṇamukha and thus accosted him, &ldquo;Friend Puṇṇamukha, Kuṇāla here is a fierce bird and has a rough tongue. Haply by your help we may win kindly speech from him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Haply we may, ladies,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="p18">And so saying, he drew near to Kuṇāla, and after a kindly greeting he sat respectfully on one side and thus addressed Kuṇāla, &ldquo;Wherefore do you, friend Kuṇāla, behave so ill to these high-born ladies of rank, though they themselves are well-conducted. One ought, friend Kuṇāla, to speak pleasantly even to ladies who are themselves ungracious in speech: much more to such as are gracious.&rdquo; When he had so spoken, Kuṇāla abused Puṇṇamukha after this manner, saying: &ldquo;Perish, vile wretch, yes, perish utterly. Who is to be found like you, won over <span class="t18">[5.224] </span><a id="a12833"></a>by the prayers of womenfolk?&rdquo;<a id="a12834"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17087"><span class="t9">{1364}</span></a> On being thus reproached the cuckoo Puṇṇamukha <span class="t18">{5.422}</span> turned back. Then surely in no long time afterwards severe sickness attacked Puṇṇamukha, and extreme suffering from a bloody flux set in, bringing him nigh unto death.</p>
<p class="p18">Then this thought occurred to the birds in attendance upon the cuckoo Puṇṇamukha, &ldquo;This cuckoo is ill; peradventure he may be raised up from his sickness.&rdquo; So leaving him quite alone they drew near to where the bird Kuṇāla was. Kuṇāla spied these birds coming from afar, and on seeing them thus addressed them, &ldquo;Where, wretches, is your lord?&rdquo; Friend Kuṇāla, they said: &ldquo;Puṇṇamukha is sick: perhaps he may be raised up from his sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p18">When they had so spoken, the bird Kuṇāla cursed them thus, &ldquo;Perish, you wretches, yes, perish utterly, you thievish, cheating, heedless, flighty creatures, ungrateful for kindness done to you, going like the wind whithersoever you list.&rdquo; So saying, he drew near to where the cuckoo Puṇṇamukha was and thus addressed him, &ldquo;Ho! Friend Puṇṇamukha.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ho! Friend Kuṇāla,&rdquo; he replied. Then the bird Kuṇāla seized the cuckoo Puṇṇamukha with his wings and beak and raising him up gave him all manner of medicines to drink. So the sickness of the cuckoo was relieved. <span class="t18">{5.423}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12835"></a>And when Puṇṇamukha was well, the birds returned and Kuṇāla for a few days gave Puṇṇamukha wild fruits to eat, and when he had recovered his strength, he said: &ldquo;Now friend, you are well again; continue to dwell with your attendant birds, and I will return to my own place of abode.&rdquo; Then Puṇṇamukha said to him, &ldquo;They left me when I was extremely ill and flew away. I have no need of these rogues.&rdquo; On hearing this the Great Being said: &ldquo;Well then, friend, I will tell you of the wickedness of womenfolk,&rdquo; and he took Puṇṇamukha and brought him to the Red Valley on a slope of the Himālayas and sat down on a rock of red arsenic at the foot of a Sāl tree, seven leagues in extent, while Puṇṇamukha with his following sat on one side.</p>
<p class="p7">Throughout all the Himālayas went a heavenly proclamation, &ldquo;Today Kuṇāla, king of birds, seated on a rock of red arsenic in the Himālayas, with all the charm of a Buddha will preach the Dhamma: hearken to him.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{5.424}</span> By proclaiming it, one to another, the gods of the six sense worlds heard of it and for the most part assembled together: many Devas too in the forest, Nāgas, Supaṇṇas, and vultures proclaimed the fact.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time Ānanda, king of the vultures, with a following of ten thousand vultures dwelt upon Vulture Peak. And on hearing the commotion he thought: &ldquo;I will listen to the preaching of the Dhamma,&rdquo; and came with his followers and sat apart. Nārada too the ascetic with the five Super Knowledges, dwelling in the Himālayas region, with his following of ten thousand ascetics, on hearing this heavenly proclamation, thought: &ldquo;My friend Kuṇāla, they <span class="t18">[5.225] </span><a id="a12836"></a>say, will speak of the faults of womankind: I too must listen to his exposition,&rdquo; and accompanied by a thousand ascetics he travelled there by his Supernormal Powers and sat on one side apart.</p>
<p class="p7">There was a great gathering like that which assembles to hear the teaching of Buddhas. Then the Great Being, with the knowledge of one who remembers his former births, making Puṇṇamukha a personal witness, related a circumstance seen in a former existence, connected with the faults of women.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx29472"></a>Summary</h4>
<p class="p18"><a id="a12837"></a>The Teacher, making the matter clear, said: Then the bird Kuṇāla thus addressed the cuckoo Puṇṇamukha, who had recently been raised up from a bed of sickness, &ldquo;Friend Puṇṇamukha, I have seen Kaṇhā, her that had a double parentage<a id="a12838"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17089"><span class="t9">{1365}</span></a><a id="a12839"></a> and five husbands,<a id="a12840"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17091"><span class="t9">{1366}</span></a><a id="a12841"></a> and whose affection was set upon a sixth man, a headless,<a id="a12842"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17093"><span class="t9">{1367}</span></a> handicapped dwarf.&rdquo; Here too we have a further verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12843"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;In ancient story Kaṇhā, it is said,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A single maid to princes five was wed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Insatiate still she lusted for yet more</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And with a humpbacked dwarf she played the whore.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;I have seen, friend Puṇṇamukha, the case of a female ascetic named Saccatapāvī, who dwelt in a cemetery and gave away even a fourth meal. She did wrong with a goldsmith.</p>
<p class="p18"><a id="a12844"></a>I witnessed too, friend Puṇṇamukha, the case of Kākātī,<a id="a12845"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17095"><span class="t9">{1368}</span></a> the wife of Venateyya, who dwelt in the midst of the sea and yet did wrong with Naṭakuvera.</p>
<p class="p18"><a id="a12846"></a>I have seen, friend Puṇṇamukha, the fair-haired Kuraṅgavī,<a id="a12847"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17097"><span class="t9">{1369}</span></a> <span class="t18">{5.425}</span> who though in love with Eḷakamāra did wrong with Chaḷaṅgakumāra and Dhanantevāsī.</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12848"></a><span class="t12">1a. This too was known to me, how the mother</span><a id="a12849"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17099"><span class="t19">{1370}</span></a><span class="t12"> of Brahmadatta, forsaking the king of Kosala,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1b. Did wrong with Pañcālacaṇḍa. These and other women went wrong, and one should not put trust in women nor praise them.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1c. As the earth is impartially affected towards all the world, bearing wealth for all, a home for all sorts and conditions of men (good and bad alike), all-enduring, unshaken, immovable, so also is it with women (in a bad sense). A man should not trust them.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;As lion fed upon raw flesh and blood,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Such like are women. Man, beware their kind.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p26">&ldquo;Verily, friend Puṇṇamukha, these creatures are not mere harlots, wenches or street-walkers, they are not so much strumpets as murderesses <span class="t18">[5.226]</span><a id="a12852"></a> &ndash; I mean these harlots, wenches, and street-walkers.<a id="a12853"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17103"><span class="t9">{1372}</span></a><a id="a12854"></a> They are like unto robbers with braided locks, like a poisoned drink, like merchants that sing their own praises, crooked like a deer&rsquo;s horn, evil-tongued like snakes, like a pit that is covered over, insatiate as hell, as hard to satisfy as a Yakkhini, like the all-rapacious Yama, all-devouring like a flame, sweeping all before it as a river, like the wind going where it lists, undiscriminating like mount Neru,<a id="a12855"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17105"><span class="t9">{1373}</span></a> fruiting perennially like a poison tree.&rdquo; Here too occurs a further verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Like poisoned draught or robber fell, crooked as horn of stag,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12856"></a><span class="t12">Like serpent evil-tongued</span><a id="a12857"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17107"><span class="t19">{1374}</span></a><span class="t12"> are they, as merchant apt to brag,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Murderous as covered pit, like hell&rsquo;s insatiate maw are they,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pernicious as a poison tree they fivefold ruin bring</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On household gear, wasters of wealth and every precious thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx29500"></a>Princess Kaṇhā</h4>
<p class="p7">In the past, they say, Brahmadatta, king of Kāsi, owing to his having an army, seized on the kingdom of Kosala, slew its king and carried off his chief queen, who was then pregnant, <span class="t18">{5.426}</span><a id="a12860"></a> to Benares and there made her his consort. By and by she gave birth to a daughter, and as the king had neither son nor daughter of his own begetting, he was greatly pleased and said: &ldquo;Fair lady, choose some boon at my hands.&rdquo; She accepted the boon but reserved her choice. Now they named the young princess Kaṇhā. So when she was grown up, her mother said: &ldquo;Dear child, your father offered me a boon, which I accepted but put off my choice: do you now choose whatever you like.&rdquo; From the excess of her passion breaking through maidenly shame she said to her mother, &ldquo;Nothing else is lacking to me; get him to hold an assembly<a id="a12861"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17111"><span class="t9">{1376}</span></a> to choose me a husband.&rdquo; The mother repeated this to the king. The king said: &ldquo;Let her have whatever she wishes,&rdquo; and he had an assembly for choosing a husband proclaimed.</p>
<p class="p7">In the palace yard a host of men assembled, arrayed in all their splendour. Kaṇhā, who with a basket of flowers in her hand stood looking out of an upper lattice window, approved of no single one of them. Then Ajjuna, Nakula, Bhīmasena, Yudhiṭṭhila, Sahadeva, of the family of king Pāṇḍu,<a id="a12862"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17113"><span class="t9">{1377}</span></a> these five sons of king Pāṇḍu, <span class="t18">[5.227]</span> I say, after receiving instruction in arts at Taxila from a world-famed teacher, travelling about with the idea of mastering local customs, arrived at Benares, and hearing a commotion in the city and learning in answer to their inquiry what it was all about, they came and stood all five of them in a row, in appearance like so many golden statues.</p>
<p class="p7">Kaṇhā on seeing them fell in love with all five, as they stood before her, and threw a wreathed coil of flowers on the head of all the five and said: &ldquo;Dear mother, I choose these five men.&rdquo; The queen told this to the king. The king, because he had given her the choice, did not say, &ldquo;You cannot do this,&rdquo; but was greatly vexed. On asking however what was their origin and whose sons they were, when he learned that they were sons of king Pāṇḍu, he paid them great honour and gave them his daughter to wife, and by the force of her passion she won the affection of these five princes in her seven-storied palace.</p>
<p class="p7">Now she had as an attendant a humpbacked man, and when by the force of passion she had won the hearts of the five princes, as soon as they had gone forth from the palace, finding her opportunity and fired by lust she did wrong with the humpbacked slave, and conversing with him she said: &ldquo;There is no one dear to me like you; I will slay these princes and have your feet smeared in the blood from their throats.&rdquo; And when she was in the company of the eldest of the royal brothers, she would say, &ldquo;You are dearer to me than those other four. For your sake I would even sacrifice my life. At my father&rsquo;s death I will bestow the kingdom on you alone.&rdquo; But when she was in the company of the others, she acted in just the same way. They were greatly pleased with her, thinking: &ldquo;She is fond of us and owing to this the sovereignty will be ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">One day she was sick, and gathering about her, one sat massaging her head, and the rest each of them a hand or foot, while the humpback sat at her feet. To the eldest brother, prince Ajjuna, who was massaging her head, she made a sign with her head, implying, &ldquo;No one is dearer to me than you are: so long as I live I shall live for you and at my father&rsquo;s death I will bestow the kingdom on you,&rdquo; and so she won his heart. To the others too she made signs with hand or foot to the same effect. But to the humpback she made a sign with her tongue which said: &ldquo;You only are dear to me: for your sake shall I live.&rdquo; All of them, owing to what had been said by her before, knew what was meant by this sign.</p>
<p class="p7">But while the rest of them each recognised the sign given to himself, prince Ajjuna <span class="t18">{5.427}</span> when he saw the motions of hand, foot or tongue, thought: &ldquo;As in my case, so also with the others, by this sign some token must be given, and there must be some intimacy with this humpbacked fellow,&rdquo; so going outside with his brothers he asked, &ldquo;Did you see the lady with five husbands making a sign with her head to me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, we did.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you know the meaning of it?&rdquo; &ldquo;We do not.&rdquo; &ldquo;The meaning of it was so and so: do you know what was meant by the sign given you <span class="t18">[5.228] </span>with hand or foot?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, we know.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the same way she gave me too a sign. Do you know the meaning of the sign given to the humpback by a motion of her tongue?&rdquo; &ldquo;We do not know.&rdquo; Then he told them, &ldquo;With him too she has done wrong.&rdquo; And when they did not believe him, he sent for the humpback and asked him, and he told them all about it.</p>
<p class="p7">When they heard what he had to say, they all lost their passionate love for her. &ldquo;Ah! Surely,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;womankind is evil and vicious. Leaving men like us, nobly born and blessed by fortune, she does wrong with a disgusting, loathsome, humpbacked fellow like this. Who that is wise will find any pleasure in consorting with women so shameless and wicked as this?&rdquo; Thus censuring womenfolk in many a turn the five princes thought: &ldquo;We have had enough of married life,&rdquo; and retired into the Himālayas, and after going through the Meditation Object practice, at the end of their life they fared according to their deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12863"></a>Kuṇāla the bird-king was prince Ajjuna, and it was for this reason that in setting forth anything that he himself had seen, he began his story with the words, &ldquo;I saw.&rdquo; In relating other things that he had seen of old he used the same words, and here follows an explanation of an incident given in the first introductory story.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx29509"></a>The Nun Saccatapāvī</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12864"></a>In the past, they say, a white-robed<a id="a12865"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17115"><span class="t9">{1378}</span></a><a id="a12866"></a> nun named Saccatapāvī had a hut of leaves built in a cemetery near Benares, and living there she abstained from four out of five meals, and throughout the city her fame was blazed abroad like as it were that of the Moon or Sun, and natives of Benares, if they sneezed or stumbled, said: &ldquo;Praise be to Saccatapāvī.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12867"></a>Now on the first day of a festival some goldsmiths had a tent erected in a certain spot where a crowd was gathered, and bringing fish, meat, strong drink, perfumes, wreaths and the like, they started a drinking bout. Then a certain goldsmith, who was addicted to drink, in vomiting said: &ldquo;Praise be to Saccatapāvī.&rdquo; On a certain wise man amongst them saying: &ldquo;Alas, blind fool, you are paying honour to a fickle-minded woman &ndash; Oh! You are a fool,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Friend, speak not thus, nor be guilty of a deed that leads to hell.&rdquo; Then the wise man said: &ldquo;You fool, hold your tongue. Lay a wager with me for a thousand crowns and on the seventh day from this, seated in this very spot, I will deliver into your hands Saccatapāvī in splendid apparel and made merry with strong drink <span class="t18">{5.428}</span> and I too will have a good drink myself with her: so unstable are womankind.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;You will not be able to do so,&rdquo; and took his wager for a thousand crowns.</p>
<p class="p7">So he told the other goldsmiths, and early next morning, disguised as an ascetic, our wise man made his way into the cemetery, and not far from her place of abode stood worshipping the Sun. She saw him as she was setting out to collect alms, and thought: &ldquo;Surely this must be an ascetic with miraculous powers. I dwell on one <span class="t18">[5.229] </span>side of the cemetery, but he in the centre of it: his heart must be full of a holy calm. I will pay my respects to him.&rdquo; So she drew near to him and saluted him, but he neither looked nor spoke. On the next day he acted in the same way. But on the third day when she saluted him, he looked down and said: &ldquo;Depart.&rdquo; On the fourth day he spoke kindly to her and said: &ldquo;Are you not tired begging for alms?&rdquo; She thought: &ldquo;I have had a kind greeting,&rdquo; and departed well pleased. On the fifth day she received a still kinder greeting and after sitting awhile she saluted him and went her ways.</p>
<p class="p7">But on the sixth day she came and saluted him as he sat there. He said: &ldquo;Sister, what in the world is this great noise of song and music in Benares today?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;Venerable sir, do you not know that a festival is proclaimed in the city and this is the sound of those that make merry there?&rdquo; Pretending not to know he said: &ldquo;Yes, this doubtless is the noise I hear.&rdquo; Then he asked, &ldquo;How many meals, sister, do you omit to take?&rdquo; &ldquo;Four, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and how many do you omit?&rdquo; &ldquo;Seven, sister,&rdquo; but in this he spoke falsely, for he used to eat all day and night. Then he asked, &ldquo;How many years is it since you took monastic vows?&rdquo; And when she said: &ldquo;Twelve, and how many since you took orders?&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;This is the sixth year.&rdquo; Then he asked, &ldquo;Sister, have you attained to a holy calm?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have not, sir. Have you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Neither have we,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We get, sister, neither the joy of sensual pleasure, nor the bliss of renunciation. What is it to us that hell is hot? Let us follow in the way of the multitude: I will become a householder, and as I own the treasure which belonged to my mother, I shall come to no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12868"></a>On hearing what he said, through her want of stability she conceived a passion for him and said: &ldquo;I too, sir, feel spiritual discontent: if you do not reject me, I too will keep house with you.&rdquo; So he said to her, &ldquo;I will not reject you: you shall be my wife.&rdquo; Then he brought her into the city and cohabited with her. And going to the drinking booth with her he himself took strong drink and handed her over to his friends the worse for liquor. So that other fellow lost his wager of a thousand crowns, and she was blessed with numerous sons and daughters by the goldsmith. At that time Kuṇāla was the goldsmith<a id="a12869"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17118"><span class="t9">{1379}</span></a> and in telling the story he began with the words, &ldquo;I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx29515"></a>Queen Kākātī</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12870"></a>In the second tale is a story of the past which is told at length in the Fourth Book in the Kākātījātaka [Ja 327].</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as the son of the king by his queen-consort. And when he was grown up, at his father&rsquo;s death he bare rule. Kākātī was his chief queen and as lovely as an Apsara. The old form of the legend will be found set forth in full in the Kunāḷajātaka [Ja 536]. Here follows a brief summary of it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now at this time a certain Garuḷa king came disguised as a man, and played at dice with the king of Benares. Falling in love with the chief queen Kākātī, he carried her off with him to the dwelling place of the Garuḷas and lived happily with her. The king missing her told his musician named Naṭakuvera to go in quest of her. He found the Garuḷa king lying on a bed of eraka grass in a certain lake, and just as the Garuḷa was on the point of leaving that spot, he seated himself in the midst of the royal bird&rsquo;s plumage, and was in this way conveyed to the dwelling place of the Garuḷas. There he enjoyed the lady&rsquo;s favours, and again seating himself on the bird&rsquo;s wing returned home. And when the time came for the Garuḷa to play at dice with the king, the minstrel took his lute and going up to the gaming board he stood before the king, and in the form of a song gave utterance to the first verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">&ldquo;Fragrant odours round me playing</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Breath of fair Kākātī&rsquo;s love,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">From her distant home conveying</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Thoughts my inmost soul to move.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12871"></a><span class="t11">On hearing this the Garuḷa responded in a second verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">&ldquo;Sea and Kebuk stream defying</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Did you reach my island home?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Over seven oceans flying</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">To the Simbal grove did come?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Naṭakuvera, on hearing this, uttered the third verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">&ldquo; &rsquo;Twas through you all space defying</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">I was borne to Simbal grove,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">And o&rsquo;er seas and rivers flying</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">&rsquo;Twas through you I found my love.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Then the Garuḷa king replied in the fourth verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">&ldquo;Out upon the foolish blunder,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">What a senseless fool I have been!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Lovers best were kept asunder,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Lo! I&rsquo;ve served as go-between.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">So the Garuḷa brought the queen and gave her back to the king of Benares, and came not there any more.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12872"></a>Now at this time Kuṇāla was the Garuḷa, and this is the reason why in illustrating what he had seen with his own eyes he began with the words &ldquo;I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx29540"></a><a id="a12873"></a>Princess Kuraṅgavī</h4>
<p class="p7">In the third story once upon a time Brahmadatta slew the king of Kosala and seized on his kingdom. Carrying off his chief queen, who was big with child, he returned to Benares, and, though he knew her condition, he made her his queen consort. When her time was fully come she gave birth to a son like an image of gold. And the queen thought: &ldquo;When he is grown up, the king <span class="t18">[5.230] </span>of Benares will say, <span class="t18">{5.429}</span> &lsquo;He is a son of my enemy: what is he to me?&rsquo; and will put him to death. Nay, let not my boy perish by an enemy&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; So she said to his nurse, &ldquo;Cover this child, my dear, with a coarse cloth and go and lay him in the charnel ground.&rdquo; The nurse did so and after bathing returned home.</p>
<p class="p7">The king of Kosala too after death was born in the form of a guardian angel of the boy, and by his divine power a female goat belonging to a goatherd, who was keeping his flock in this spot, on seeing the child conceived an affection for him and after giving him milk to suck wandered off for a bit, and then came back twice, thrice or even four times, and gave him suck. The goatherd, on seeing what the goat was about, came to the spot, and when he saw the child conceived an affection for it and brought it to his wife. Now she was childless and therefore had no milk to give him. So the female goat continued to give it suck.</p>
<p class="p7">From that day two or three goats died every day. The goatherd thought: &ldquo;If this boy goes on being tended by us, all our goats will perish. What is he to us?&rdquo; Then he laid him in an earthenware vessel, covering him up with another, and smeared his face all over, without leaving any chink, with the flour of beans, and dropped him into the river. The child was carried down by the stream and was found on the lower bank near the king&rsquo;s palace by a low-caste mender of old rubbish, who was there with his wife, washing his face. He ran up in haste pulled the vessel out of the water and laid it on the bank. &ldquo;What have we here?&rdquo; he thought, and uncovering the vessel found the child. His wife too was childless and she also conceived an affection for him. So she took him home and watched over him.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12874"></a>When he was seven or eight years old, his father and mother would take him with them when they went to the palace. When he was sixteen years old, the lad often went to the palace to mend old things. And the king and queen consort had a daughter named Kuraṅgavī, a girl of extraordinary beauty. From the moment she set eyes upon him she fell in love with the youth, and not caring for any one else she constantly repaired to the place where he worked. From their repeatedly seeing one another they were mutually enamoured, and secretly within the royal precincts guilty relations were established.</p>
<p class="p7">In course of time the servants told the king. In his rage be called his councillors together and said: &ldquo;Such and such acts have been committed by this low-caste fellow: consider what must be done with him.&rdquo; His councillors made answer, &ldquo;Great is his offence; after exacting all manner of punishment we must put him to death.&rdquo; At this moment the lad&rsquo;s father (the king of Kosala), who had become his guardian angel, took possession of the body of the youth&rsquo;s mother, and under the influence of tthe Deva she drew near to the king and said: &ldquo;Sire, this youth is no low-caste fellow. He is the son born to me by the king of Kosala. In saying that my boy was dead, I lied to you. Knowing him to be the child of your enemy I gave him to <span class="t18">[5.231] </span>a nurse and had him exposed in a charnel ground. Then a goatherd watched over him, but when his goats all began to die, he had him cast into the river, and being transported here by the stream, he was found by the low-caste man who repairs old rubbish in our palace and fostered by him, and if you do not believe me, call for all these people and inquire of them.&rdquo; The king summoned all of them, beginning with the nurse, and learning on inquiry that the facts were as she stated, he was delighted to find that the youth was nobly born, and giving directions that he should take a bath and put on splendid apparel, he gave him his daughter in marriage.</p>
<p class="p7">Now from his having brought about the death of the goats <span class="t18">{5.430}</span> they named him Eḷakamāra (Goat&rsquo;s Bane). Then the king assigned him a transport and an army and sent him off, saying: &ldquo;Go and take possession of the kingdom that was your father&rsquo;s.&rdquo; So he set off with Kuraṅgavī and was established on the throne.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king of Benares thought: &ldquo;He is quite uneducated,&rdquo; and to instruct him in arts he sent Chaḷaṅgakumāra to be his teacher. Accepting him as his teacher he conferred on him the post of commander-in-chief. By and by Kuraṅgavī committed adultery with him. And the commander-in-chief had an attendant named Dhanantevāsī, and he sent by his hand robes and other adornments to Kuraṅgavī, and she went wrong with him too. So vicious and immoral are wicked women, and therefore I praise them not.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12875"></a>This the Great Being taught in telling a story of the past, for at that time he was Chaḷaṅgakumāra, and therefore the incident he related was one he saw with his own eyes.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx29549"></a>Queen Kosaladevī</h4>
<p class="p7">In the fifth story once upon a time a king of Kosala seized the kingdom of Benares and made the king&rsquo;s chief queen, who at that time was pregnant, his queen consort, and then returned to his own city. By and by she gave birth to a son. The king, because he had no children of his own, fondly cherished the boy and had him instructed in all learning, and when he was of age he sent him away, bidding him take possession of the kingdom which had belonged to his father. He went and reigned there.</p>
<p class="p7">Then his mother saying she longed to see her boy took leave of the king of Kosala, and setting out for Benares with a large escort took up her abode in a town lying between the two kingdoms. In this place dwelt a certain handsome brahmin youth named Pañcālacaṇḍa. He brought her a present. On seeing him she fell in love and committed adultery with him. After spending a few days there, she went to Benares and saw her son. On returning she took up her abode in the same town and, after spending several days in guilty intercourse with her lover, she departed to Kosala city. Very soon after this, giving this or that reason for visiting her son, she took leave of the king and in going and returning stayed a fortnight in the same town, misconducting herself with her lover. So wicked and false, Sampuṇṇamukha, are women.</p>
<p class="p7">And in telling this story of the past he began with the words, &ldquo;To the same effect also is this tale.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx29553"></a><a id="a12876"></a>Four Injurious Things</h4>
<p class="p7">Hereafter, <span class="t18">[5.232] </span>in a variety of ways exhibiting the charm with which he preached the Dhamma, he said: &ldquo;Friend Puṇṇamukha, there are four things which, if certain circumstances arise, prove injurious &ndash; these, I say, are not to be lodged in a neighbour&rsquo;s household &ndash; an ox, a cow, a chariot, a wife. From these four things a wise man would keep his house clear:<a id="a12877"></a><span class="t18"> {5.433}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Ox, cow, nor car to neighbours lend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor trust a wife to house of friend:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The car they break through want of skill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The ox by over-driving kill.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. The cow is over-milked before long,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The wife in kinsman&rsquo;s house goes wrong.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx29562"></a>Six Injurious Things</h4>
<p class="p18"><a id="a12878"></a>There are six things, friend Puṇṇamukha, which under certain circumstances prove injurious: A bow lacking its string, a wife living in a kinsman&rsquo;s family, another&rsquo;s ship, a carriage with broken axle, an absent friend, a wicked comrade, under certain circumstances, prove injurious.</p>
<h4 class="h42"><a id="ncx29564"></a><a id="a12879"></a><a id="a12880"></a>Eight Grounds for Despising</h4>
<p class="p18">Verily on eight grounds, friend Puṇṇamukha, a woman despises her husband: for poverty, for sickness, for old age, for drunkenness, for stupidity, for carelessness, for attending to every kind of business, for neglecting every duty towards her &ndash; verily, on these eight grounds a woman despises her lord. Here moreover occurs this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;If poor or sick or old, a sot, or reckless thought,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If dull or by his cares of business overwrought,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or disobliging found &ndash; such lord a wife esteems as nought.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h43"><a id="ncx29569"></a>Nine Grounds for Blame</h4>
<p class="p18">Verily on nine grounds does a woman incur blame: if she is fond of frequenting parks, gardens, and river banks, fond of visiting the houses of kinsfolk or of strangers, given to wearing the adornment of cloth worn by gentlemen, if she is a drinker of strong drink, given to staring about her, or of standing before her door &ndash; on these nine grounds, I say, a woman incurs blame. Here moreover occurs the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;A woman dressed in smart cloth vest, dram-drinking, apt to roam</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In pleasance, park, by river side, to friend&rsquo;s or stranger&rsquo;s home,</span></p>
<p class="p28"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Standing before her door, to stare about with idle gaze,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In nine such ways corrupted soon from path of virtue strays.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h43"><a id="ncx29576"></a>Forty Seductive Ways</h4>
<p class="p18"><a id="a12881"></a>Verily, friend Puṇṇamukha, in forty different ways a woman makes up to a man.<a id="a12882"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17120"><span class="t9">{1380}</span></a> She draws herself up, she bends down, she frisks about, she looks coy, she presses together her finger tips, she plants one foot on the other, she scratches the ground with a stick, she dances her boy up and down, <span class="t18">{5.434}</span> she plays and makes the boy play, she kisses and makes him kiss her, she eats and gives him to eat, she either gives or begs something, whatever is done she mimics, she speaks in a high or low tone, she speaks <span class="t18">[5.233] </span>now indistinctly, now distinctly, she appeals to him with dance, song and music, with tears or coquetry, or with her finery, she laughs or stares, she shakes her dress or shifts her loin-cloth, exposes or covers up her leg, exposes her bosom, her armpit, her navel, she closes her eye, she elevates her eyebrow, she pinches her lip, makes her tongue loll out, looses or tightens her cloth dress, looses or tightens her head-gear. Verily in these forty ways she makes up to a man.</p>
<h4 class="h42"><a id="ncx29578"></a>Twenty-Five Ways of Wickedness</h4>
<p class="p18">Verily, friend Puṇṇamukha, a wicked woman is to be known in twenty-five different ways: she praises her lord&rsquo;s absence from home, she rejoices not in his return, she speaks in his dispraise, she is silent in his praise, she acts to his injury, and not to his advantage, she does whatever is harmful to him and refrains from what is serviceable, she goes to bed with her clothes on and lies with her face averted from him, she tosses about from side to side, she makes a great ado, she heaves a long-drawn sigh, she feels a pain, she frequently has to solicit nature, she acts perversely, on hearing a stranger&rsquo;s voice she opens her ear and listens attentively, she is a waster of her lord&rsquo;s goods, she is intimate with her neighbours, she gads abroad, she walks the streets, she is guilty of adultery, disregarding her husband she has wicked thoughts in her heart. Verily in these twenty-five ways, friend Puṇṇamukha, is a wicked woman to be known. Here moreover occurs this utterance:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;Her husband&rsquo;s absence she approves nor grieves should he depart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor at the sight of his return rejoices in her heart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She ne&rsquo;er at any time will say aught in her husband&rsquo;s praise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Such are the signs that surely mark the wicked woman&rsquo;s ways.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. Undisciplined, against her lord some mischief she will plot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His interest neglects and does the thing that she ought not,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With face averted lies she down beside him, fully dressed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By such like signs her wickedness is surely thus confessed.</span><span class="t18"> {5.435}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12883"></a><span class="t12">13. Restless she turns from side to side nor lies one moment still,</span><a id="a12884"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17122"><span class="t19">{1381}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or heaves a long drawn sigh and groans, pretending she is ill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As if at nature&rsquo;s call from bed she oftentimes will rise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By such like signs her wickedness a man may recognise.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. Perverse in all her acts she does the thing she should eschew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And hearkens to the stranger&rsquo;s voice, her favours should he sue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Her husband&rsquo;s wealth is freely spent some other love to gain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By signs like these her wickedness to all is rendered plain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. The wealth that by her lord with toil was carefully amassed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The gear so painfully heaped up, behold, she squanders fast,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With neighbours far too intimate the lady soon will grow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And by such signs the wickedness of women one may know.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. Stepping abroad behold her how she walks about the streets,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And with the grossest disrespect her lord and master treats:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor of adultery stops short, corrupt in heart and mind &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By such like signs how wicked are all womenfolk we find.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. Often she will at her own door all decency defy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And shamelessly expose herself to any passing by,</span><span class="t18"> [5.234]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The while with troubled heart she looks around on every side &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By such like signs the wickedness of women is descried.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. As groves are made of wood, as streams in curves and windings flow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So, give them opportunity, all women wrong will go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. Yea give them opportunity and secrecy withal,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And every single woman will from paths of virtue fall:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus will all women wantons prove, should time and place avail,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And e&rsquo;en with humpback dwarf does wrong, should other lovers fail.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. Women that serve for man&rsquo;s delight let every one distrust,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fickle in heart they ever are and unrestrained in lust.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ladies of pleasure fitly called, the basest of the base,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To all then such as common are as any bathing place.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.437}</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx29627"></a>Queen Kinnarā</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12885"></a>Moreover he said: In the past at Benares was a king named Kaṇḍari<a id="a12886"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17124"><span class="t9">{1382}</span></a><a id="a12887"></a><a id="a12888"></a> who was a very handsome man, and to him daily his counsellors would bring a thousand boxes of perfume, and with this perfume they would make the house trim and neat, and then splitting up the boxes they would make scented firewood and cook the food therewith. Now his wife was a lovely woman named Kinnarā, and his family priest Pañcālacaṇḍa was the same age as himself and full of wisdom. And in the wall near the king&rsquo;s palace grew a Jambu plum tree and its branches hung down upon the wall, and in the shade of it dwelt a loathsome, misshapen man.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day queen Kinnarā looking out of her window saw him and conceived a passion for him. <span class="t18">{5.438}</span> And at night after winning the king&rsquo;s favour by her charms, as soon as he had fallen asleep, she would get up softly and putting all manner of dainty food in a golden vessel and taking it on her hips, she would let herself down through the window by means of a rope of cloth, and climbing up the Jambu plum tree drop down by a branch of it and give her dainty food to the misshapen man and take her pleasure with him, and then ascend to the palace the same way that she had come down, and after shampooing herself all over with perfumes lie down by the king&rsquo;s side. In this way she would constantly misconduct herself with this man and the king knew nothing of it.</p>
<p class="p7">One day the king after a solemn procession round the city was entering his palace when he saw this misshapen man, a pitiable object, lying in the shade of the Jambu plum, and he said to his family priest, &ldquo;Just look at this ghost of a man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it possible, my friend, that any woman moved by lust would come nigh such a loathsome creature?&rdquo; Hearing what he said the man, swelling with pride, thought: &ldquo;What is it this king said? I think he knows nothing of his queen&rsquo;s coming to visit me.&rdquo; And stretching out his folded hands towards the Jambu plum tree he cried, &ldquo;O my lord, you guardian spirit of this tree, excepting you no one knows about this.&rdquo; The family priest noticing his action thought: &ldquo;Of a truth the king&rsquo;s chief consort by the help of this tree comes and misconducts herself with him.&rdquo; So he said to the king, &ldquo;Sire, at night what is it like when you come into contact with the queen&rsquo;s person?&rdquo; <span class="t18">[5.235]</span> &ldquo;I notice nothing else,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but that at the middle watch her body is cold.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, sire, whatever may be the case with other women, your queen Kinnarā misconducts herself with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is this you say, my friend? Would such a charming lady take her pleasure with this disgusting creature?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then, sire, put it to the proof.&rdquo; &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said the king, and after supper he lay down with her, to put it to the test.</p>
<p class="p7">At the usual time for falling asleep, he pretended to drop off, and she acted as before. The king following in her steps took his stand in the shade of the Jambu plum tree. The handicapped man was in a rage with the queen and said: &ldquo;You are very late in coming,&rdquo; and struck with his hand the chain in her ear. So she said: &ldquo;Be not angry, my lord; I was watching for the king to fall asleep,&rdquo; and so saying she acted as it were a wife&rsquo;s part in his house. But when he struck her, the ear-ornament, which was like a lion&rsquo;s head, falling from her ear dropped at the king&rsquo;s feet. The king thought: &ldquo;Just this will be the best thing for me,&rdquo; and he took it away with him. And after misconducting herself with her lover she returned just as before and proceeded to lie down by the side of the king.</p>
<p class="p7">The king rejected her advances and next day he gave an order, saying: &ldquo;Let queen Kinnarā come, wearing every ornament I have given her.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;My lion&rsquo;s head jewel is with the goldsmith,&rdquo; and refused to come. When a second message was sent, she came with only a single ear-ornament. <span class="t18">{5.439}</span> The king asked, &ldquo;Where is your earring?&rdquo; &ldquo;With the goldsmith.&rdquo; He sent for the goldsmith and said: &ldquo;Why do you not let the lady have her earring?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have it not, sire.&rdquo; The king was enraged and said: &ldquo;You wicked, vile woman, your goldsmith must be a man just like me,&rdquo; and so saying he threw the earring down before her and said to the family priest, &ldquo;Friend, you spoke the truth; go and have her head chopped off.&rdquo; So he secured her in a certain quarter of the palace and came and said to the king, &ldquo;Sire, be not angry with queen Kinnarā: all women are just the same. If you are anxious to see how immoral women are, I will show you their wickedness and deceitfulness. Come, let us disguise ourselves and go into the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king readily agreed and, handing over his kingdom to his mother, he set out on his travels with his family priest. When they had gone a league&rsquo;s journey and were seated by the high road, a certain gentleman of property, who was holding a marriage festival for his son, had seated the bride in a closed carriage and was accompanying her with a large escort. On seeing this the family priest said: &ldquo;If you like, you can make this girl misconduct herself with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;What say you, my friend? With this great escort the thing is impossible.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then see this, my lord?&rdquo; And going forward he set up a tent-shaped screen not far from the high road and, placing the king inside the screen, himself sat down by the side of the road, weeping.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the gentleman on seeing it asked, &ldquo;Why, friend, are you weeping?&rdquo; &ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was heavy <span class="t18">[5.236] </span>with child and I set out on a journey to take her to her own home, and while still on the way her pangs overtook her and she is in trouble within the screen, and she has no woman with her and I cannot go to her there. I do not know what will happen.&rdquo; &ldquo;She ought to have a woman with her: do not weep, there are numbers of women here; one of them shall go to her.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then let this maiden come; it will be a happy omen for the girl.&rdquo; He thought: &ldquo;What he says is true: it will be an auspicious thing for my daughter-in-law. She will be blessed with numerous sons and daughters,&rdquo; and he brought her there.</p>
<p class="p7">Passing inside the screen she fell in love at first sight with the king and committed adultery with him, and the king gave her his signet ring. So when the deed was done and she came out of the tent they asked her, &ldquo;What has she given birth to?&rdquo; &ldquo;A boy the colour of gold.&rdquo; So the gentleman took her and went off. The family priest came to the king and said: &ldquo;You have seen, sire, even a young girl is thus wicked. How much more will other women be so? Pray, sir, did you give her anything?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I gave her my signet ring.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will not allow her to keep it.&rdquo; And he followed in haste and caught up the carriage, and when they said: &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;This girl has gone off with a ring my brahmin wife had laid on her pillow: give up the ring, lady.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{5.440}</span> In giving it she scratched the brahmin&rsquo;s hand, saying: &ldquo;Take it, you rogue.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12889"></a>Thus did the brahmin in a variety of ways show the king that many other women are guilty of misconduct, and said: &ldquo;Let this suffice here; we will now go elsewhere, sire.&rdquo; The king traversed all Jambudīpa, and they said: &ldquo;All women will be just the same. What are they to us? Let us turn back.&rdquo; So they went straight home to Benares. The family priest said: &ldquo;It is thus, sire, with all women; so wicked is their nature. Forgive queen Kinnarā.&rdquo; At the prayer of his family priest he pardoned her, but had her thrust out from the palace. And when he had ejected her from the place, he chose another queen-consort, and he had the misshapen man driven forth and ordered the Jambu plum branch to be lopped off. At that time Kuṇāla was Pañcālacaṇḍa. So in telling the story of what he had seen with his own eyes, in illustration he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12890"></a><span class="t12">21. &ldquo;This much from tale of Kaṇḍari and Kinnarā is shown;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All women fail to find delight in homes that are their own.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus does a wife forsake her lord, though lusty he and strong,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And will with any other man, e&rsquo;en misshapen, go wrong.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx29641"></a>Ugly Pañcapāpā</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12891"></a><a id="a12892"></a>Another story is this: In the past a king of Benares, Baka by name, ruled his kingdom righteously. At that time a certain poor man, who dwelt by the eastern gate of Benares, had a daughter named Pañcapāpā.<a id="a12893"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17126"><span class="t9">{1383}</span></a> It is said that in a former birth as a poor man&rsquo;s daughter she was kneading clay and plastering a wall. Then a Paccekabuddha <span class="t18">[5.237] </span>thought: &ldquo;Where am I to get clay to make this mountain cave neat and trim? I can get it in Benares.&rdquo; So putting on his cloak, and bowl in hand, he went into the city and took his stand not far from this woman. She was angry, and, looking at him, thought: &ldquo;In his wicked heart he is begging for clay as well as alms.&rdquo; The Paccekabuddha stood without moving. So, when she saw that he remained motionless, she was converted, and, looking at him once more, she said: &ldquo;Priest, you have got no clay,&rdquo; and she took a big lump and put it in his bowl, and with this clay he made things neat in his cave. <span class="t18">{5.441}</span> And as a reward for this lump of clay, her person became soft to the touch, but in consequence of her angry look her hands, feet, mouth, eyes and nose became hideously ugly, and so men knew her by the name of Pañcapāpā (The Five Defects).</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12894"></a>Now the king of Benares was once wandering about the city by night and came to this spot, and she was playing with the village girls, and not recognising the king she seized him by the hand. As the result of her touch he lost all control over himself, and was as it were thrilled by a heavenly touch, and inflamed by passion he caught her by the hand, though she was so hideous to look upon, and asked whose daughter she was. When she answered, &ldquo;Daughter of a dweller by the gate,&rdquo;<a id="a12895"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17128"><span class="t9">{1384}</span></a> and he heard she was unmarried, he said: &ldquo;I will be your husband: go and ask your parents&rsquo; consent.&rdquo; She went to her father and mother and said: &ldquo;A certain man wishes to marry me.&rdquo; On their assenting, and saying: &ldquo;He too must be a poor, sorry creature, if he desires one like you,&rdquo; she came and told him that her parents consented. So he cohabited with her in that very house, and quite early in the morning sought his palace.</p>
<p class="p7">From that day the king constantly came there in disguise, and did not care to look at any other woman. Now one day her father was attacked with a bloody flux. The remedy for his sickness was a constant supply of rice gruel prepared with milk, ghee, honey, and sugar, and this, owing to their poverty, they could not procure. Then the mother said to the daughter, &ldquo;My dear, would your husband be able to procure us some rice gruel?&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my husband must be even poorer than we are; but even if this is so, I will ask him: do not be worried.&rdquo; So saying, about the time when he should return, she sat down as if in a disconsolate state. When the king came he asked why she was so sad, and on hearing what was the matter, he said: &ldquo;My dear, whence shall I get this very powerful remedy?&rdquo; And he thought: &ldquo;I cannot continually keep coming here in this way; one must consider the risk one runs in the journey to and fro; but if I were to take her to the court, being ignorant of her possession of a soft touch, they will make a mock of me and say, &ldquo;Our king has returned with a Yakkhini.&rdquo; But if I make all the city acquainted with her <span class="t18">[5.238] </span>touch, I shall do away with all reproach against myself.&rdquo; So he said to her, &ldquo;My dear, do not vex yourself: I will bring your father some rice gruel,&rdquo; and so saying, after taking his pleasure with her he returned to his palace.</p>
<p class="p7">The next day he had some rice gruel such as she described boiled for her, and, taking some leaves, made two baskets with them, and in one he put the rice gruel, and in the other he placed a jewelled diadem and fastened them up. And at night he came and said: &ldquo;My dear, we are poor: I got this with great difficulty. You are to say to your father, &ldquo;Today eat the rice gruel from this basket, and tomorrow from that.&rdquo; She did accordingly. So her father, after eating a very little of it, from its invigorating qualities was soon satisfied, and the rest she gave to her mother, and herself <span class="t18">{5.442}</span> partook of it, and all three of them felt very happy, and the basket containing the jewelled diadem they reserved for the needs of the next day.</p>
<p class="p7">The king on reaching his palace washed his face and said: &ldquo;Bring me my diadem.&rdquo; On their saying: &ldquo;We cannot find it,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Search through the whole city.&rdquo; They searched, but still did not find it. &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Search in the houses of the poor outside the city, beginning with the baskets of leaves for food.&rdquo; They searched and found the jewel diadem in this house, and crying out, &ldquo;This woman&rsquo;s father and mother are thieves,&rdquo; they bound them and brought them to the king. Then her father said: &ldquo;My lord, we are no thieves; a certain man brought us this jewel.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My son-in-law,&rdquo; he answered. When asked where he was, he said: &ldquo;My daughter knows.&rdquo; Then he had a word with her. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know who your husband is.&rdquo; &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; &ldquo;If this is so, we are undone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear father, he comes when it is dark, and departs before it is light, so I do not know his appearance, but I can recognise him by the touch of his hand.&rdquo; Her father told this to the king&rsquo;s officers, and they told the king.</p>
<p class="p7">The king, pretending ignorance of the whole matter, said: &ldquo;Well, place the woman in a tent screen in the palace yard and cut a hole in the curtain as big as a man&rsquo;s hand and call the citizens together, and detect the thief by the touch of his hand.&rdquo; The officers did as he bade them. On going to her and seeing what she was like they were filled with loathing, and said: &ldquo;She is a Yakkhini,&rdquo; and in their disgust they did not dare to touch her. But they brought and placed her within a screen in the palace yard and gathered together all the citizens.</p>
<p class="p7">Seizing hold of the hand of every one that came, as it was stretched out through the hole, she said: &ldquo;This is not the man.&rdquo; The people were so captivated by the heavenly touch of her they could not tear themselves away. They thought: &ldquo;If she be worthy of punishment, though we should have to inflict blows upon her with a stick, yet we should be ready to undergo any servile tasks for her, and to take her home as our wedded wife.&rdquo; Then the king&rsquo;s men beat them and drove them away, and all of them, beginning with the <span class="t18">[5.239] </span>viceroy, behaved like madmen.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king said: &ldquo;Could I possibly be the man?&rdquo; and stretched forth his hand. The woman, seizing his hand, cried aloud, &ldquo;I have got the thief.&rdquo; The king inquired of his men, &ldquo;When your hand was seized by her what did you think of it?&rdquo; They told him exactly how it was with them. So the king said: &ldquo;This is why I made them bring her to my house. Had they known nothing of her touch, they would have despised me. And now that all of you have learned the facts from me, say in whose house ought she to dwell as wife.&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;In your house, sire.&rdquo; So, with the ceremonious sprinkling, he recognised her as his chief consort, <span class="t18">{5.443}</span> and bestowed great power on her father and mother. Thenceforth in his infatuation he neither set on foot any inquiries about her, nor so much as looked at any other woman.</p>
<p class="p7">The other queens sought to discover the mystery respecting her. One day she saw in a dream some indication of her being the chief queen of two kings, and she told her dream to the king. The king summoned the interpreters of dreams and asked, &ldquo;What is the meaning of such and such a dream being seen by her?&rdquo; Now they had received a bribe from the other women, and said: &ldquo;The fact of the queen&rsquo;s sitting on the back of a perfectly white elephant is a token of your death, and that she touches the moon as she rides upon the elephant&rsquo;s back is a sign of her bringing some hostile king against you.&rdquo; &ldquo;What then is to be done?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You cannot put her to death, sire, but you must place her on board a ship and let her drift down the stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king in the night put her on board, with food, garments, and adornments and sent her adrift on the river. As she was carried down in the vessel by the stream she came face to face with king Pāvāriya, as he was disporting himself in the river. His commander-in-chief on seeing it said: &ldquo;This ship belongs to me.&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;Its cargo is mine,&rdquo; and when the ship reached them and they saw the woman he said. &ldquo;Who are you, so like a Yakkhini as you are?&rdquo; She, smiling, said she was the chief consort of king Baka, and told him all her story, and that she was renowned throughout Jambudīpa as Pañcapāpā. Then the king, taking her by the hand, lifted her out of the vessel, and no sooner had he taken her hand than he was inflamed with passion at her touch, and in the case of his other wives ceased to regard them as worthy the name of women, and he raised her to the position of chief queen, and she was as dear as his own life to him.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12896"></a>Baka, on hearing what had happened, said: &ldquo;I will not allow him to make her his queen consort,&rdquo; and getting together an army, he took up his quarters in a port on the opposite side of the river, and sent a message to this effect, that Pāvāriya was either to surrender his wife or give battle. His rival was ready for battle, but the councillors of the two kings said: &ldquo;For the sake of a woman there is no need to die. From his being her first husband she belongs to Baka, but from his having rescued her from the ship she <span class="t18">[5.240] </span>belongs to Pāvāriya. Therefore let her be for the space of seven days at a time in the house of each of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">After due deliberation they gained over the two kings to this view, and they both were highly pleased, and built cities on opposite banks of the river and took up their abode there, and the woman accepted the position of chief consort to the pair of kings, and they were both infatuated with her. Now she dwelt seven days in the house of one of them, and then crossed over in a ship to the abode of the other, and when in mid-stream she committed adultery with the pilot who steered the vessel, a lame and bald old man. At that time Kuṇāla, <span class="t18">{5.444}</span> the king of birds, was Baka, and so he spoke of this as something he had seen with his own eyes, and to illustrate it he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;Wife of Pāvārika and Baka too,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(Two kings whose lust no pause or limit knew)</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet does wrong with devoted husband&rsquo;s slave;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With what vile wretch would she not misbehave?&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx29658"></a>Queen Piṅgiyānī</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12897"></a><a id="a12898"></a><a id="a12899"></a>Yet another story: In the past the wife of Brahmadatta, Piṅgiyānī by name, opening her window looked out and saw a royal groom, and, when the king had fallen asleep, she got down through the window and committed adultery with him, and then again climbed back to the palace and shampooed her person with perfumes and lay down with the king. Now one day the king thought: &ldquo;I wonder why at midnight the person of the queen is always cool: I will examine into the matter.&rdquo; So one day he pretended to be asleep and got up and followed her and saw her committing folly with a groom. He returned and climbed up to his chamber, and she too after she had been guilty of adultery came and lay down on the small bed. Next day the king, in the presence of his ministers, summoned her and made known her misconduct, saying: &ldquo;All women alike are sinners.&rdquo; And he forgave her offence, though it deserved death, imprisonment, mutilation, or cleaving asunder, but he deposed her from her high rank and made someone else his queen consort. At that time king Kuṇāla was Brahmadatta, and so it was that he told this story as of something he had seen with his own eyes, and by way of illustration he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. &ldquo;Fair Piṅgiyānī was as wife adored</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By Brahmadatta, earth&rsquo;s all conquering lord,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet did wrong with devoted husband&rsquo;s slave,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And lost by lechery both king and cheat.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.445}</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx29664"></a>Summary Verses</h4>
<p class="p7">After telling of the defilements of women in old world stories, in yet another way, still speaking of their misdeeds, he said:</p>

<p class="p7">On hearing him Ānanda, the vulture king, said: &ldquo;My friend, Kuṇāla, I too by my own powers of knowledge will tell of women&rsquo;s faults,&rdquo; and he began to speak of them. The Fortunate One by way of illustration said: &ldquo;Then, verily, Ānanda, the vulture king, marking the beginning, middle and end of what the bird Kuṇāla had to say, at this time uttered these verses:<span class="t18"> {5.448}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. &ldquo;Although a man with all this world contains of golden gear</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. Let him not trust because he thinks she fancies me, I know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor let him trust because her tears oft in his presence flow;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They court the man they hate as much as one that they adore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Just as a ship that hugs alike the near and farther shore.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12906"></a><span class="t12">39. Trust not a litter strewn with leaves and branches long ago,</span><a id="a12907"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17136"><span class="t19">{1388}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Trust not your whilom friend, perchance now grown into a foe,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Trust not a woman though she has borne children ten to thee.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">40. Women are pleasure-seekers all and unrestrained in lust,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Transgressors of the moral law: in such put not your trust.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A wife may feign unbounded love before her husband&rsquo;s face;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Distrust her: women common are as any landing place.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">41. Ready to mutilate or slay, from nothing do they shrink,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And after having cut his throat they e&rsquo;en his blood would drink:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let no man fix his love on them, creatures of passions base,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">42. In speech they no distinction make betwixt the false and true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As kine the choicest herbage pick, rich lovers they pursue.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">44. Dishonest, fierce and hard of heart, as sugar sweet their words,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nothing there is they do not know to cheat their wedded lords.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">45. Surely all womenfolk are vile, no limit bounds their shame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Impassioned and audacious they, devouring as a flame.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">46. Women are not so formed, this man to love and that abhor,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They court the man they hate as much as one that they adore,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">47. &rsquo;Tis not a case of love or hate with womenfolk we see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">It is for gold they hug a man, as parasites a tree.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12910"></a><span class="t12">48. A man may corpses burn or e&rsquo;en dead flowers from temples rake,</span><a id="a12911"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17140"><span class="t19">{1390}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be groom of horse or elephant, or care of oxen take,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet women after such low castes will run for money&rsquo;s sake.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a12912"></a>Thus did Ānanda, the vulture king, keeping to facts within his own knowledge, tell of the bad qualities of women, and then held his peace.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx29776"></a>The Ascetic Nārada</h4>
<p class="p7">Nārada, too, after hearing what he had to say, keeping to what <span class="t18">[5.243] </span>he himself knew, spoke of their bad qualities.</p>
<p class="p7">In illustrating this the Teacher said: &ldquo;Then verily Nārada, hearing the beginning, middle and end of what Ānanda, the vulture king, had to say, at this point repeated these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">50. &ldquo;Four things can never sated be &ndash; list well to these my words &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ocean, kings, brahmins, womankind, these four, O king of birds.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">51. All streams in earth that find their home will not the ocean fill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though all may with its waters mix, something is lacking still.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12913"></a><span class="t12">52. A brahmin cons</span><a id="a12914"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17142"><span class="t19">{1391}</span></a><span class="t12"> his Vedas and his legendary lore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet still he sacred knowledge lacks and craves for more and more.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">53. A king by conquest holds the world, its mountains, seas and all,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The endless treasures it contains his very own may call,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet sighs for worlds beyond the sea, for this he counts too small.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">54. One woman may have husbands eight, compliant to her will,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All heroes bold, well competent love&rsquo;s duties to fulfil,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet on a ninth her love she sets, for something lacks she still.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">55. Women like flames devour their prey,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Women like floods sweep all away,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Women are pests, like thorns are they,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Women for gold oft go astray.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">56. That man with net might catch the breeze,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or single-handed bale out seas,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Clap with one hand, who once should dare</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His thoughts let range on woman fair.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">57. With women, clever jades, truth aye is found a rarity,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12915"></a><span class="t12">Their ways as much perplex as those of fishes in the sea.</span><a id="a12916"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17144"><span class="t19">{1392}</span></a><span class="t18"> {5.451}</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They burn him up as fuel burns cast in a blazing fire.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When Nārada had thus set forth the vices of women, the Great Being once more by special instances illustrated their bad qualities.<span class="t18"> {5.452}</span></p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx29818"></a>The Kuṇāla Bird</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12919"></a>To show this the Teacher said: &ldquo;So verily the bird Kuṇāla, after learning the beginning, middle and conclusion of what Nārada had to say, repeated at this time these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">61. &ldquo;E&rsquo;en a wise man may dare to exchange a word</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Speech, smiles, with dance and song, their only arms:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unstable souls they harass, as erewhile</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">66. If one they know is rich, on him they fall</span></p>

And the elves and mighty serpents and the like in the Himālayas, and the angels standing in the air, all applauded, saying: &ldquo;Bravo! Spoken with all the charm of a Buddha.&rdquo; Ānanda, the vulture king, Nārada, the lordly brahmin, Puṇṇamukha, the royal cuckoo, each with his own following, retired to their respective places, and the Great Being too departed to his own abode. But the others from time to time returned and received instruction at the hands of the Great Being, and abiding by his admonition became destined to Heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher here ended his lesson and identifying the Jātaka repeated the final verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">80. &ldquo;Udāyi royal cuckoo was, Ānanda vulture king,</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="t30">Thus are you to understand this Jātaka.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now these monks, when they came, came by the supernatural power of the Teacher, and on returning returned by their own power. And the Teacher revealed to them in the Great Forest the means by which Absorption may be induced, and that very day they attained to Arahatship. There was a mighty gathering of Devas, so the Fortunate One declared to them the Mahāsamayasutta [DN 20].</span></p>
