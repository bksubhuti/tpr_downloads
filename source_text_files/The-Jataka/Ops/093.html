<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the Buddha advises the king of Kosala to live righteously, and he tells a story of a childless king who adopted three foundling birds. When mocked by his court, he had them brought one by one to court and asked them for advice on ruling his kingdom, and all agreed they should be promoted to positions of honour.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the bird Jambuka (Jambukasakuṇa),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a12092"></a><span class="t15">Sāriputta = (the owl) Vessantara,</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a12093"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Wisdom, Righteousness.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo; &rsquo;Tis this I ask.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[5.59] {5.109}</span><a id="a12094"></a><a id="a12095"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told by way of admonition to the king of Kosala. Now this king came to hear the preaching of the Dhamma and the Teacher addressed him in the following terms, &ldquo;A king, sire, ought to rule his kingdom righteously, for whenever kings are unrighteous, then also are his officers unrighteous.&rdquo; And admonishing him in the right way as related in the Catukkanipāta (4th Book) [Ja 334] he pointed out the suffering and the blessing involved in following or abstaining from evil courses, and expounded in detail the misery resulting from sensual pleasures, comparing them to dreams and the like, saying: &ldquo;In the case of these men,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">No bribe can move relentless death, no kindness mollify,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">No one in fight can vanquish death. For all are doomed to die.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12096"></a><span class="t30">And when they depart to another world, except their own virtuous action they have no other sure refuge, so that they must inevitably forsake low associations, and for their reputation&rsquo;s sake they must not be careless, but be earnest and exercise rule in righteousness, even as kings of old, before Buddha arose, abiding in the admonition of the wise, ruled righteously and departing attained to the heavenly city,&rdquo; and at the request of the king he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past Brahmadatta ruled in Benares and had no heir, and his prayer for a son or daughter was not answered. Now one day he went with a large escort to his park and after amusing himself a part of the day in the grounds <span class="t18">{5.110}</span> he had a couch spread for him at the foot of the royal Sāl tree, and after a short nap he awoke and, looking up to the Sāl tree, he beheld a bird&rsquo;s nest in it, and at the sight of it a desire to possess it sprang up in his heart, and summoning one of his attendants he said: &ldquo;Climb the tree and see if there is anything in the nest or not.&rdquo; The man climbed up and finding three eggs in it told the king. &ldquo;Then mind you do not breathe over them,&rdquo; he said, and, spreading some cotton in a casket, he told the man to come down gently, and place the eggs in it. When they had been brought down, he took up the casket and asked his courtiers to what bird these eggs belonged. They answered, &ldquo;We do not know: hunters will know.&rdquo; The king sent for the hunters and asked them. &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;one is an owl&rsquo;s egg, another is a mynah bird&rsquo;s, and the third is a parrot&rsquo;s.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pray are there eggs of three different birds in <span class="t18">[5.60] </span>one nest?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sire, when there is nothing to fear, what is carefully deposited does not perish.&rdquo; The king being pleased said: &ldquo;They shall be my children,&rdquo; and committing the three eggs to the charge of three courtiers, he said: &ldquo;These shall be my children. Do you carefully watch over them and when the young birds come out of the shell, let me know.&rdquo; They took good care of them.</p>
<p class="p7">First of all the owl&rsquo;s egg was hatched, and the courtier sent for a hunter and said: &ldquo;Find out the sex of the young bird, whether it is a chicken or a hen bird,&rdquo; and when he had examined it and declared it to be a chicken bird, the courtier went to the king and said: &ldquo;Sire, a son is born to you.&rdquo; The king was delighted and bestowed much wealth on him and saying, <span class="t18">{5.111}</span> &ldquo;Watch carefully over him and call his name Vessantara,&rdquo; he sent him away. He did as he was told.</p>
<p class="p7">Then a few days afterwards the egg of the mynah bird was hatched, and the second courtier likewise, after getting the huntsman to examine it, and hearing it was a hen bird, went to the king and announced to him the birth of a daughter. The king was delighted, and gave to him also much treasure and saying: &ldquo;Watch carefully over my daughter and call her name Kuṇḍalinī,&rdquo; he sent him away. He also did what he was told.</p>
<p class="p7">Then after a few days the parrot&rsquo;s egg was hatched and the third courtier, when told by the huntsman who examined it that it was a chicken bird, went and announced to the king the birth of a son. The king was delighted and paying him liberally said: &ldquo;Hold a festival in honour of my son with great pomp, and call his name Jambuka,&rdquo; and then sent him away. He too did as he was told.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx24900"></a><a id="a12097"></a>The Story of Vessantara&rsquo;s Question</h4>
<p class="p7">And these three birds grew up in the houses of the three courtiers with all the ceremony due to royalty. The king speaks of them habitually, as &lsquo;my son&rsquo; and &lsquo;my daughter.&rsquo; His courtiers made merry, one with another, saying: &ldquo;Look at what the king does: he goes about speaking of birds as his son and his daughter.&rdquo; The king thought: &ldquo;These courtiers do not know the extent of my children&rsquo;s wisdom. I will make it evident to them.&rdquo; So he sent one of his ministers to Vessantara to say, &ldquo;Your father wishes to ask you a question. When shall he come and ask it?&rdquo; The minister came and bowing to Vessantara delivered the message. Vessantara sent for the courtier who looked after him and said: &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; they tell me, &ldquo;wants to ask me a question. When he comes, we must show him all respect,&rdquo; and he asked, &ldquo;When is he to come?&rdquo; The courtier said: &ldquo;Let him come on the seventh day from this.&rdquo; Vessantara on hearing this said: &ldquo;Let my father come on the seventh day from this,&rdquo; and with these words he sent the minister away. He went and told the king.</p>
<p class="p7">On the seventh day the king ordered a drum to be beaten through the city and went to the house where his son lived. Vessantara treated the king with great respect and had great respect paid even to the slaves and hired servants. The king, after partaking of food in the house of Vessantara, and enjoying great distinction, returned to his <span class="t18">[5.61] </span>own dwelling-place. Then he had a big pavilion erected in the palace-yard, and, having made proclamation by beating a drum through the city, he sat in his magnificent pavilion surrounded by a great retinue <span class="t18">{5.112}</span> and sent word to a courtier to conduct Vessantara to him. The courtier brought Vessantara on a golden stool. The bird sat on his father&rsquo;s lap and played with his father, and then went and sat on the stool. Then the king in the midst of the crowd of people questioned him as to the duty of a king and spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis this I ask Vessantara &ndash; dear bird, may you be blessed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To one that&rsquo;s fain o&rsquo;er men to reign, what course of life is best?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Vessantara, without answering the question directly, reproved the king for his carelessness and spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Kaṁsa my sire, of Kāsi lord, so careless long ago,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Urged me his son, though full of zeal, still greater zeal to show.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Rebuking the king in this verse and saying: &ldquo;Sire, a king ought to rule his kingdom righteously, abiding in the three truths,&rdquo; and telling of a king&rsquo;s duty he spoke these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;First of all should a king put away all falsehood and anger and scorn;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let him do what a king has to do, or else to his vow be forsworn.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. By passion and wrong led astray, should he err in the past, it is plain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He will live to repent of the deed, and will learn not to do it again.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. When a prince in his rule groweth slack, untrue to his name and his fame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should his wealth all at once disappear, of that prince it is counted as shame.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &rsquo;Twas thus that Good Fortune and Luck, when I asked, made reply unto me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In a man energetic and bold we delight, if from jealousy free.</span><span class="t18"> {5.113}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Ill Luck, ever wrecking good fortune, delighteth in men of ill deeds,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The hard-hearted creatures in whom a spirit of jealousy breeds.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. To all, O great king, be a friend, so that all may your safety insure,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ill Luck put away, but to Luck that is good be a dwelling secure.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. The man that is lucky and bold, O you that o&rsquo;er Kāsi do reign,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His foes will destroy root and branch, and to greatness will surely attain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Great Sakka all courage in man ever watches with vigilant eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For courage as virtue he holds and in it true goodness espies.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. Gandhabbas, Petas, Devas, one and all, emulate such a king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They all appearing stand by, of his zeal and his vigour to sing.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. Be zealous to do what is right, nor, however reviled, yield to wrong,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be earnest in efforts for good &ndash; no sluggard can bliss ever win.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. Herein is the text of your duty, to teach you the way you should go:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis enough to win bliss for a friend or to work grievous ill for a foe.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.115}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the bird Vessantara in a single verse rebuke the carelessness of the king, and then in telling the duty of a king in eleven verses answered his question with all the charm of a Buddha. The hearts of the multitude were filled with wonder and amazement and innumerable shouts of applause were raised. The king was transported with joy and addressing his courtiers asked them what was to be done for his son, for <span class="t18">[5.62] </span>having spoken thus. &ldquo;He should be made a general in the army, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I give him the post of general,&rdquo; and he appointed Vessantara to the vacant post. Thenceforth placed in this position he carried out his father&rsquo;s wishes. <span class="t18">{5.116}</span></p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx24942"></a><a id="a12098"></a>The Story of Kuṇḍalinī&rsquo;s Question</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12099"></a>Again the king after some days, just as before, sent a message to Kuṇḍalinī, and on the seventh day he paid her a visit and returning home again he seated himself in the centre of a pavilion and ordered Kuṇḍalinī to be brought to him, and when she was seated on a golden stool, he questioned her as to the duty of a king and spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;Kuṇḍalinī, of royal birth, could you resolve my quest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To one that&rsquo;s fain o&rsquo;er men to reign, what course of life is best?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the king thus asked her as to the duties of a king, she said: &ldquo;I suppose, sir, you are putting me to the test, thinking: &ldquo;What will a woman be able to tell me?&rdquo; so I will tell you, putting all your duty as a king into just two maxims,&rdquo; and she repeated these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;The matter, my friend, is set forth in a couple of maxims quite plain:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To keep whatsoever one has, and whatever one has not to gain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. Take as counsellors men that are wise, your interests clearly to see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Not given to riot and waste, from gambling and drunkenness free.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. Such a one as can guard you aright and your treasure with all proper zeal,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As a charioteer guides his car, he with skill steers the realm&rsquo;s common weal.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12100"></a><span class="t12">18. Keep ever your folk well in hand; and duly take stock of your pelf,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ne&rsquo;er trust to another a loan or deposit, but act for thyself.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. What is done or undone to your profit and loss it is well you should know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ever blame the blameworthy and favour on them that deserve it bestow.</span><span class="t18"> {5.117}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. You thyself, O great king, should instruct your people in every good way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lest your realm and your substance should fall to unrighteous officials a prey.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. See that nothing is done by thyself or by others with overmuch speed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For the fool that so acts without doubt will live to repent of the deed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. To wrath one should never give way, for should it due bounds overflow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">It will lead to the ruin of kings and the proudest of houses lay low.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. Be sure that you never as king your people mislead to their cost,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lest all men and women alike in an ocean of trouble be lost.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. When a king from all fear is set free, and the pleasures of sense are his aim,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should his riches and all disappear, to that king it is counted as shame.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. Herein is a text of your duty, to teach you the way you should go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be an adept in every good work, to excess and to riot a foe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Study virtue, for vice ever leads to a state full of suffering and woe.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.120}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did Kuṇḍalinī also teach the king his duty in eleven verses. The king was delighted and addressing his courtiers asked them, saying: &ldquo;What is to be given to my daughter as a reward for her having spoken thus?&rdquo; &ldquo;The office of treasurer, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then, I grant her the post of treasurer,&rdquo; and he appointed Kuṇḍalinī to the vacant post. Thenceforth she held the office and acted for the king. <span class="t18">[5.63]</span></p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx24981"></a>The Story of Jambuka&rsquo;s Question</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12101"></a>Again the king after the lapse of a few days, just as before, sent a messenger to the wise Jambuka, and going there on the seventh day and being magnificently entertained he returned home and in the same manner took his seat in the centre of a pavilion. A courtier placed the wise Jambuka on a stool bound with gold, and came bearing the stool on his head. The wise bird sitting on his father&rsquo;s lap and playing with him at length took his seat on the golden stool. Then the king, asking him a question, spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve questioned both your brother prince, and also fair Kuṇḍalinī;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now, Jambuka, do you in turn the highest power declare to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the king, in asking a question of the Great Being, not ask him in the way in which he had asked the others, but asked him in a special way. Then the wise bird said to him, &ldquo;Well, sire, listen attentively, and I will tell you all,&rdquo; and like a man placing a purse containing a thousand pieces of money into an outstretched hand, he began his exposition of a king&rsquo;s duty:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. &ldquo;Amidst the great ones of the earth a fivefold power we see;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of these the power of limbs is, sure, the last in its degree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And power of wealth, O mighty lord, the next is said to be.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">28-29. The power of counsel third in rank of these, O king, I name;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The power of caste without a doubt is reckoned fourth in fame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And all of these a man that&rsquo;s wise most certainly will claim.</span><span class="t18"> {5.121}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">30. Of all these powers that one is best, as power of learning known,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By strength of this a man is wise and makes success his own.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">31. Should richest realm fall to the lot of some poor stupid wight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Another will by violence seize it in his despite.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">32. However noble be the prince, whose lot it is to rule,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He is hard put to live at all, if he should prove a fool.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">33. &rsquo;Tis wisdom tests reports of deeds and makes men&rsquo;s fame to grow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who is with wisdom gifted still finds pleasure e&rsquo;en in woe.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">34. None that are heedless in their ways to wisdom can attain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But must consult the wise and just, or ignorant remain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">35. Who early rising shall betimes unweariedly give heed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To duty&rsquo;s varied calls, in life is certain to succeed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. No one that&rsquo;s bent on hurtful things or acts in listless mood</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In aught that he may undertake will come to any good.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. But one that will unweariedly a rightful course pursue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is sure to reach perfection in whatever he may do.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. To safeguard one&rsquo;s store is to gain more and more,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And these are the things I would have you to mind;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For the fool by ill deeds, like a house built of reeds,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Collapses and leaves rack and ruin behind.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.123}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Bodhisatta in all these points sing the praises of the five powers, and exalting the power of wisdom, like to one striking the orb of the moon with his words, he admonished the king in eleven verses:<span class="t18"> [5.64]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">39. &ldquo;To wives and to children, warrior king, do righteously; and so,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.</span><a id="a12102"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16650"><span class="t19">{1155}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{5.124}</span></p>

<p class="p13"><a id="a12103"></a><span class="t25">40. To friends and courtiers, warrior king, do righteously; and so</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">41. In war and travel, warrior king, do righteously; and so</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">42. In town and village, warrior king, do righteously; and so</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">43. In every land and realm, O king, do righteously; and so</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t25">44. To brahmins and ascetics all, do righteously; and so</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t25">46. Do righteously, O warrior king; from this all blessings flow:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">By living according to Dhamma to heaven the king shall go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">47. With watchful vigilance, O king, on paths of goodness go:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">The brahmins, Sakka, and the gods have won their godhead so.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After uttering ten verses about the way of righteousness, still further admonishing the king he spoke the concluding verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">48. &ldquo;Herein is the text of your duty, to teach you the way you should go:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Follow wisdom and ever be happy, the truth in its fulness to know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being, as though he were letting down the heavenly Ganges, teach the Dhamma with all the charm of a Buddha. And the multitude paid him great honour and raised innumerable shouts of applause. The king was delighted and addressing his councillors asked, <span class="t18">{5.125}</span> &ldquo;How ought my son, wise Jambuka, with a beak like the fresh fruit of the Jambu plum, to be rewarded for having spoken thus?&rdquo; &ldquo;With the post of commander-in-chief, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I offer him this post,&rdquo; he said, and appointed him to the vacant office, and thenceforth in the position of commander-in-chief he carried out the orders of his father. Great honour was paid to the three birds, and all three of them gave instruction in temporal and spiritual matters. The king, abiding in the admonition of the Great Being, by generosity and other good works became destined to heaven. The councillors after performing the king&rsquo;s obsequies, speaking to the birds said: &ldquo;My lord, Jambu, the king ordered the royal umbrella to be raised over you.&rdquo; The Great Being said: &ldquo;I have no need of the kingdom, do you exercise rule with all vigilance,&rdquo; and after establishing the people in the precepts, he said: &ldquo;Execute justice,&rdquo; and he had righteous judgment inscribed on a golden plate and disappeared in the forest. And his admonition continued in force forty thousand years.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher by means of his admonition of the king taught this lesson and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the king was Ānanda, Kuṇḍalinī was Uppalavaṇṇā, Vessantara was Sāriputta, the bird Jambu was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

The Teacher, on hearing of his death, went to Rājagaha and took up his abode in the Bamboo Grove. An elder dwelt there on the slopes of Isigili (Mount of Saints) at the Black Rock. This man, by attaining perfection in Supernormal Powers, was able to make his way into heaven and hell. In the Deva world he beheld one of the disciples of Buddha enjoying great power, and in the world of men he saw one of the disciples of the heretics suffering great agony, and on returning to the world of men he told them how in a certain Deva world such and such a lay brother or sister was reborn and enjoying great honour, and amongst the followers of the heretics such and such a man or woman was reborn in hell </span><span class="t18">{5.126}</span><a id="a12119"></a><span class="t30"> or other states of suffering. People gladly accepted his dispensation and rejected that of the outsiders. Great honour was paid to the disciples of Buddha, while that paid to the schismatics fell away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">They conceived a grudge against the elder, and said: &ldquo;As long as this fellow is alive, there are divisions amongst our followers, and the honour paid to us falls away: we will put him to death,&rdquo; and they gave a thousand pieces of money to a brigand who guarded the ascetics to put the elder to death. He resolved to kill the elder, and came with a great following to Black Rock. The elder, when he saw him coming, by his Supernormal Powers flew up into the air and disappeared. The brigand, not finding the elder that day, returned home and came back day after day for six successive days. But the elder, by his Supernormal Powers, always disappeared in the same way. On the seventh day an act committed of old by the elder, carrying with it consequences to be recognised on some future occasion, got its chance for mischief.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12120"></a><span class="t30">The story goes that once upon a time, hearkening to what his wife said, he wanted to put his father and mother to death; and, taking them in a carriage to a forest, he pretended that they were attacked by robbers, and struck and beat his parents. Through feebleness of sight being unable to see objects clearly, they did not recognise their son, and thinking they were robbers said: &ldquo;Dear son, some robbers are killing us: make your escape,&rdquo; and lamented for him only. He thought: &ldquo;Though they are being beaten by me, it is only on my account they make lamentation. I am acting shamefully.&rdquo; So he reassured them and, pretending that the robbers had been put to flight, he stroked their hands and feet, saying: &ldquo;Dear father and mother, do not be afraid, the robbers have fled,&rdquo; and brought them again to their own house. This action for ever so long not finding its opportunity but ever biding its time, like a core of flame hidden under ashes, caught up and seized upon the man when he was reborn for the last time, and the elder, in consequence of his action, was unable to fly up into the air. His Supernormal Powers that once could quell Nanda and Upananda</span><a id="a12121"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16657"><span class="t9">{1158}</span></a><span class="t30"> and cause Vejayanta to tremble, as the result of his action became mere feebleness.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12122"></a><span class="t30">The brigand crushed all his bones, subjecting him to the &ldquo;straw and meal&rdquo; torture,</span><a id="a12123"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16659"><span class="t9">{1159}</span></a><span class="t30"> and, thinking he was dead, went off with his followers. But the elder, on recovering consciousness, clothed himself with meditation as with a garment, and flying up by Supernormal Powers into the presence of the Teacher, saluted him and said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, my sum of life is exhausted: I would die,&rdquo; and having gained the Teacher&rsquo;s consent, he died then and there.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At that instant the six Deva worlds were in a general state of commotion. &ldquo;Our Teacher,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;is dead.&rdquo; And they came, bringing incense and perfume and wreaths breathing divine odours, and all kinds of wood, </span><span class="t18">{5.127}</span><span class="t30"> and the funeral pile was made of sandalwood and ninety-nine precious things.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, standing near the elder, ordered his remains to be deposited, and for the space of a league all round about the spot where the body was burned flowers rained down upon it, and men and gods stood mingled together, and for seven days held a sacred festival. The Teacher had the relics of the elder gathered together, and erected a shrine in a gabled chamber in the Bamboo Grove.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At that time they raised the topic in the Dhamma Hall, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, Sāriputta, because </span><span class="t18">[5.66] </span><span class="t30">he did not die in the presence of the Tathāgata, has not received great honour at the hands of the Buddha, but the great elder Moggallāna, because he died near the Teacher, has had great honour paid to him.&rdquo; The Teacher came up, and asking the monks what they were sitting in a meeting to discuss, on hearing what it was, said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but formerly also Moggallāna received great honour at my hands,&rdquo; and, so saying, he related a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12124"></a><a id="a12125"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was conceived by the brahmin wife of the royal family priest, and at the end of ten months was born early in the morning. At that moment there was a blaze of all kinds of arms in the city of Benares for the space of twelve leagues. The priest, on the birth of the boy, stepped out of doors and looked up to the sky for the purpose of divining his son&rsquo;s destiny, and knew that this boy, because he was born under a certain conjunction in the heaven, would surely be the chief archer in all Jambudīpa. So he went betimes to the palace and inquired after the king&rsquo;s health. On his replying, &ldquo;How, my master, can I be well: this day there is a blaze of weapons throughout my dwelling-place,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Fear not, sire; not merely in your house, but throughout all the city is this blaze of arms to be seen. This is due to the fact that a boy is born today in our house.&rdquo; &ldquo;What, master, will be the result of the birth of a boy under these conditions?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing, sire, but he will prove to be the chief archer in all Jambudīpa.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, master, do you then watch over him, and when he is grown up, present him to us.&rdquo; And so saying, he ordered a thousand pieces of money to be given him as the price of his nurture.<a id="a12126"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16661"><span class="t9">{1160}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">The priest took it and went home, and on the naming-day of his son, on account of the blaze of arms at the moment of his birth, he called him Jotipāla [Guardian of Light]. He was reared in great state, and at the age of sixteen he was extremely handsome. Then his father, observing his personal distinction, said: &ldquo;Dear son, go to Taxila <span class="t18">{5.128}</span> and receive instruction in all learning at the hands of a world-famous teacher.&rdquo; He agreed to do so and, taking his teacher&rsquo;s fee, he bade his parents farewell and repaired there. He presented his fee of one thousand pieces of money and set about acquiring instruction, and in the course of seven days he had reached perfection. His master was so delighted with him that he gave him a precious sword that belonged to him, and a bow of ram&rsquo;s-horn and a quiver, both of them deftly joined together, and his own coat of mail and a diadem, and he said: &ldquo;Dear Jotipāla, I am an old man, do you now train these pupils,&rdquo; and he handed over to him five hundred pupils.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta, taking everything with him, said good-bye to his teacher and, returning to Benares, went to see his parents. Then his father, on seeing him standing respectfully before him, said: &ldquo;My son, have you finished your studies?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; On hearing his <span class="t18">[5.67] </span>answer he went to the palace and said: &ldquo;My son, sire, has completed his education: what is he to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Teacher, let him wait on us.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you decide, sire, about his expenses?&rdquo; &ldquo;Let him receive a thousand pieces of money daily.&rdquo; He readily agreed to this, and returning home he called his boy to him and said: &ldquo;Dear son, you are to serve the king.&rdquo; Thenceforth he received every day a thousand pieces of money and attended on the king.</p>
<p class="p7">The king&rsquo;s attendants were offended, &ldquo;We do not see that Jotipāla does anything, yet he receives a thousand pieces of money every day. We should like to see a specimen of his skill.&rdquo; The king heard what they said and told the priest. He said: &ldquo;All right, sire,&rdquo; and told his son. &ldquo;Very well, dear father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on the seventh day from this I will show them: let the king assemble all the archers in his dominion.&rdquo; The priest went and repeated what he said to the king. The king, by beat of drum through the city, had all his archers gathered together. When they were assembled, they numbered sixty thousand. The king, on hearing that they were assembled, said: &ldquo;Let all that dwell in the city witness the skill of Jotipāla.&rdquo; And making proclamation by beat of drum, he had the palace yard made ready, and, followed by a great crowd, <span class="t18">{5.129}</span> he took his seat on a splendid throne, and, when he had summoned the archers, he sent for Jotipāla.</p>
<p class="p7">He put the bow and quiver and coat of mail and diadem, which had been given to him by his teacher, beneath his under garment, and had the sword carried for him, and then came before the king in his ordinary garb and stood respectfully on one side. The archers thought: &ldquo;Jotipāla, they say, has come to give us a specimen of his skill, but from his coming without a bow he will evidently want to receive one at our hands,&rdquo; but they all agreed they would not give him one.</p>
<p class="p7">The king, addressing Jotipāla, said: &ldquo;Give us proof of your skill.&rdquo; So he had a tent-like screen thrown round about him, and taking his stand inside it, and doffing his cloak, he girt on his armour, and got into his coat of mail and fastened the diadem on his head. Then he fixed a string of the colour of coral on his ram&rsquo;s-horn bow, and binding his quiver on his back and fastening his sword on his left side, he twirled an arrow tipped with adamant on his nail, and threw open the screen and sallied forth like a Nāga prince bursting out of the earth, splendidly equipped, and stood making an obeisance to the king. The multitude, on seeing him, jumped about and shouted and clapped their hands.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12127"></a>The king said: &ldquo;Jotipāla, give us a specimen of your skill.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;amongst your archers are men who pierce like lightning,<a id="a12128"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16664"><span class="t9">{1161}</span></a><a id="a12129"></a> able to split a hair, and to shoot at a sound (without seeing) and to cleave a (falling) arrow.<a id="a12130"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16666"><span class="t9">{1162}</span></a> Summon <span class="t18">[5.68] </span>four of these archers.&rdquo; The king summoned them. The Great Being set up a pavilion in a square enclosure in the palace yard, and at the four corners he stationed the four archers, and to each of them he had thirty thousand arrows allotted, assigning men to hand the arrows to each, and he himself taking an arrow tipped with adamant stood in the middle of the pavilion and cried, &ldquo;O king, let these four archers all at once shoot their arrows to wound me; I will ward off the arrows shot by them.&rdquo; The king gave the order for them to do so. &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we shoot as quick as lightning, and are able to split a hair, and to shoot at the sound of a voice (without seeing), and to cleave a (falling) arrow, but Jotipāla is a mere stripling; we will not shoot him.&rdquo; The Great Being said: &ldquo;If you can, shoot me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; they said, and with one accord they shot their arrows. The Great Being, striking them severally with his iron arrow, in some way or other, <span class="t18">{5.130}</span><a id="a12131"></a> made them drop on the ground, and then throwing a wall<a id="a12132"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16668"><span class="t9">{1163}</span></a> round them, he piled them together and so made a magazine of arrows, fitting each arrow, handle level with handle, stock with stock, feathers with feathers, till the bowmen&rsquo;s arrows were all spent, and when he saw that it was so, without spoiling his magazine of arrows, he flew up into the air and stood before the king.</p>
<p class="p7">The people made a great uproar, shouting and dancing about and clapping their hands, and they threw off their garments and ornaments, so that there was treasure lying in a heap to the amount of eighteen crores. Then the king asked him, &ldquo;What do you call this trick, Jotipāla?&rdquo; &ldquo;The arrow-defence, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are there any others that know it?&rdquo; &ldquo;No one in all Jambudīpa, except myself, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Show us another trick, friend.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, these four men stationed at four corners failed to wound me. But if they are posted at the four corners, I will wound them with a single arrow.&rdquo; The archers did not dare to stand there.</p>
<p class="p7">So the Great Being fixed four plantains at the four corners, and fastening a scarlet thread on the feathered part of the arrow, he shot it, aiming at one of the plantains. The arrow struck it and then the second, the third and the fourth, one after another, and then struck the first, which it had already pierced, and so returned to the archer&rsquo;s hand; while the plantains stood encircled with the thread. The people raised myriad shouts of applause. The king asked, &ldquo;What do you call this trick, friend?&rdquo; &ldquo;The pierced circle, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Show us something more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12133"></a>The Great Being showed them the arrow-stick, the arrow-rope, the arrow-plait, and performed other tricks called the arrow-terrace, arrow-pavilion, arrow-wall,<a id="a12134"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16670"><span class="t9">{1164}</span></a> arrow-stairs, arrow-tank, and made the arrow-lotus to blossom and caused it to rain a shower of arrows. <span class="t18">[5.69] {5.131}</span></p>
<p class="p7">Thus did he display these twelve unrivalled acts of skill, and then he cleft seven incomparably huge substances. He pierced a plank of fig-wood, eight inches thick, a plank of asana wood, four inches thick, a copper plate two inches thick, an iron plate one inch thick, and after piercing a hundred boards joined together, one after another, he shot an arrow at the front part of wagons full of straw and sand and planks, and made it come out at the back part; and, shooting at the back of the wagons, he caused the arrow to come out at the front. He drove an arrow through a space of over a furlong in water and more than two furlongs of earth, and he pierced a hair, at the distance of half a furlong, at the first sign of its being moved by the wind. And when he had displayed all these feats of skill, the sun set.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king promised him the post of commander-in-chief, saying: &ldquo;Jotipāla, it is too late today; tomorrow you shall receive the honour of the chief command. Go and have your beard trimmed and take a bath,&rdquo; and that same day he gave him a hundred thousand pieces of money for his expenses. The Great Being said: &ldquo;I have no need of this,&rdquo; and he gave his lords eighteen crores of treasure and went with a large escort to bathe; and, after he had had his beard trimmed and had bathed, arrayed in all manner of adornments, he entered his abode with unparalleled pomp. After enjoying a variety of dainty viands, he got up and lay down on a royal couch, and when he had slept through two watches, in the last watch he woke up and sat cross-legged on his couch, considering the beginning, the middle and the end of his feats of skill.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12135"></a>&ldquo;My skill,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;in the beginning is evidently death, in the middle it is the enjoyment of wrongdoing, and in the end it is rebirth in hell: for the destruction of life and excessive carelessness in sinful enjoyment causes rebirth in hell. The post of commander-in-chief is given me by the king, and great power will accrue to me, and I shall have a wife and many children; but if the objects of desire are multiplied, it will be hard to get rid of desire. I will go forth from the world alone and enter the forest: <span class="t18">{5.132}</span> it is right for me to adopt the life of an ascetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12136"></a>So the Great Being arose from his couch, and without letting anybody know, he descended from the terrace, and going out by the house-door<a id="a12137"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16672"><span class="t9">{1165}</span></a><a id="a12138"></a> he went into the forest all alone, and repaired to a spot on the banks of the Godhāvarī, near the Kaviṭṭha<a id="a12139"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16674"><span class="t9">{1166}</span></a> forest, three leagues in extent. Sakka, hearing of his renunciation of the world, summoned Vissakamma and said: &ldquo;Friend, Jotipāla has renounced the world; a great company will gather round him. Build a hermitage on the banks of the Godhāvarī in the Kaviṭṭha forest and provide them with everything necessary <span class="t18">[5.70] </span>for the ascetic life.&rdquo; Vissakamma did so.</p>
<p class="p7">The Great Being, when he reached the place, saw a road for a single foot-passenger and thought: &ldquo;This must be a place for ascetics to dwell in,&rdquo; and travelling by this road and meeting with no one, he entered the hut of leaves. On seeing the requisites for ascetic life he said: &ldquo;Sakka, king of heaven, I think, knew that I had renounced the world,&rdquo; and, doffing his cloak, he put on an inner and outer robe of dyed bark and threw an antelope&rsquo;s skin over one shoulder. Then be bound up his coil of matted locks, shouldered a basket of three bushels of grain, took a mendicant&rsquo;s staff and sallied forth from his hut, and climbing up the covered walk, he paced up and down it several times. Thus did he glorify the forest with the beauty of asceticism, and after focusing on the Meditation Object,<a id="a12140"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16676"><span class="t9">{1167}</span></a><a id="a12141"></a> on the seventh day of his ascetic life he developed the eight Attainments and five Super Knowledges, and lived quite alone, feeding on what he could glean and on roots and berries.</p>
<p class="p7">His parents and a crowd of friends and kinsfolk and acquaintances, not seeing him, wandered about disconsolate. Then a certain forester, who had seen and recognised the Great Being in the Kaviṭṭha hermitage, told his parents and they informed the king of it. The king said: &ldquo;Come, let us go and see him,&rdquo; and taking the father and mother, and accompanied by a great multitude, he arrived at the bank of the Godhāvarī by the road which the forester pointed out to him. The Bodhisatta, on coming to the riverbank, seated himself in the air, and after teaching them the Dhamma, <span class="t18">{5.133}</span> he brought them all into his hermitage, and there too, seated in the air, he revealed to them the misery involved in sensual desires and taught them the Dhamma. And all of them, including the king, adopted the ascetic life.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta continued to dwell there, surrounded by a band of ascetics. And the news that he was dwelling there was blazed abroad throughout all Jambudīpa. Kings with their subjects came and took orders at his hands, and there was a great assembly of them till they gradually numbered many thousands. Whoever reflected on thoughts of lust, or the wish to hurt or injure others, to him the Great Being came, and seated in the air before him, he taught him the Dhamma and instructed him in focusing on the Meditation Object.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12142"></a>His seven chief pupils were Sālissara,<a id="a12143"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16678"><span class="t9">{1168}</span></a> Meṇḍissara, Pabbata, Kāḷadevala, Kisavaccha, Anusissa, and Nārada. And they, abiding in his admonition, attained to Absorption and reached perfection. By and by the Kaviṭṭha hermitage became crowded, and there was no room for the multitude of ascetics to dwell there. So the Great Being, addressing Sālissara, said: &ldquo;Sālissara, this hermitage is not big enough for the crowd of ascetics; do you go with this company of them and take up your abode near the town of Lambacullaka in <span class="t18">[5.71] </span>the province of king Caṇḍapajjota.&rdquo; He agreed to do so and, taking a company of many thousands, went and dwelt there.</p>
<p class="p7">But as people still came and joined the ascetics, the hermitage was full again. The Bodhisatta, addressing Meṇḍissara, said: &ldquo;On the borders of the country of Suraṭṭha is a stream called Sātodikā. Take this band of ascetics and dwell on the borders of that river.&rdquo; And he sent him away.</p>
<p class="p7">In the same way on a third occasion he sent Pabbata, saying: &ldquo;In the great forest is the Añjana mountain: go and settle near that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">On the fourth occasion he sent Kāladevala, saying: &ldquo;In the south country in the kingdom of Avanti is the Ghanasela mountain: settle near that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Kaviṭṭha hermitage again overflowed, though in five different places there was a company of ascetics numbering many thousands. And Kisavaccha, asking leave of the Great Being, <span class="t18">{5.134}</span> took up his abode in the park near the commander-in-chief, in the city of Kumbhavatī in the province of king Daṇḍaki. Nārada settled in the central province in the Arañjara chain of mountains, and Anusissa remained with the Great Being.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12144"></a><a id="a12145"></a>At this time king Daṇḍaki deposed from her position a courtesan whom he had greatly honoured, and, roaming about at her own will, she came to the park, and seeing the ascetic Kisavaccha, she thought: &ldquo;Surely this must be Kāḷakaṇṇi [Bad Luck]. I will get rid of my wrongdoing<a id="a12146"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16680"><span class="t9">{1169}</span></a> on his person and will then go and bathe.&rdquo; And first biting her tooth-stick, she spat out a quantity of phlegm, and not only spat upon the matted locks of the ascetic, but also threw her tooth-stick at his head and went and bathed. And the king, calling her to mind, restored her to her former position. And infatuated by her folly, she came to the conclusion that she had recovered this honour because she had got rid of her wrongdoing on the person of Kāḷakaṇṇi.</p>
<p class="p7">Not long after this the king deposed his family priest from his office, and he went and asked the woman by what means she had recovered her position. So she told him it was from having got rid of her offence on the person of Kāḷakaṇṇi in the royal park. The priest went and got rid of his wrongdoing in the same way, and him too the king reinstated in his office. Now by and by there was a disturbance on the king&rsquo;s frontier, and he went forth with a division of his army to fight. Then that infatuated priest asked the king, saying: &ldquo;Sire, do you wish for victory or defeat?&rdquo; When he answered, &ldquo;Victory,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Well, Kāḷakaṇṇi dwells in the royal park; go and convey your wrongdoing to his person.&rdquo; He approved of the suggestion and said: &ldquo;Let these men come with me to the park and get rid of their wrongdoing on the person of Kāḷakaṇṇi.&rdquo; And going into the park, he first of all nibbled his tooth-stick and let his spittle and the stick fall on the ascetic&rsquo;s matted locks and then bathed his head, and his army did likewise. When the king had departed the commander-in-chief came, and seeing the <span class="t18">[5.72] </span>ascetic, he took the tooth-stick out of his locks and had him thoroughly washed and then asked, &ldquo;What will become of the king?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, there is no evil thought in my heart, but the gods <span class="t18">{5.135}</span> are angry and on the seventh day from this all his kingdom will be destroyed: do you flee with all speed and go elsewhere.&rdquo; He was terribly alarmed, and went and told the king. The king refused to believe him, so he returned to his own house, and taking his wife and children with him, he fled to another kingdom.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12147"></a>The master Sarabhaṅga,<a id="a12148"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16682"><span class="t9">{1170}</span></a> hearing about it, sent two youthful ascetics and had Kisavaccha brought to him in a palanquin through the air. The king fought a battle, and taking the rebels prisoners returned to the city. On his return the gods first caused it to rain from heaven, and when all the dead bodies had been washed away by the flood of rain, there was a shower of heavenly flowers on the top of the clean white sand, and on the flowers there fell a shower of small coins, and after them a shower of big pieces of money, and this was followed by a shower of heavenly ornaments. The people were highly delighted and began to pick up ornaments of gold, even fine gold. Then there rained upon their persons a shower of all manner of blazing weapons, and the people were cut piece-meal. Then a shower of blistering embers fell on them, and over these huge blazing mountain peaks, followed by a shower of fine sand filling a space of sixty cubits. Thus was a part of his realm sixty leagues in extent destroyed, and its destruction was blazed abroad throughout all Jambudīpa.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12149"></a><a id="a12150"></a>Then the lords of subordinate kingdoms within his realm, the three kings, Kaliṅga, Aṭṭhaka, Bhīmaratha, thought: &ldquo;In the past in Benares, Kalābu, king of Kāsi, having done wrong against the ascetic Khantivādī [Ja 313], it is reported he was swallowed up in the earth, and Nāḷikīra in like manner having given ascetics to be devoured by dogs, and Ajjuna<a id="a12151"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16684"><span class="t9">{1171}</span></a> of the thousand arms who did wrong against Aṅgīrasa likewise perished, and now again king Daṇḍaki, having done wrong against Kisavaccha, report says, is destroyed, realm and all. We know not the place where these four kings are reborn: no one except Sarabhaṅga, our master, is able to tell us this. We will go <span class="t18">{5.136}</span> and ask him.&rdquo; And the three kings went forth with great pomp to ask this question. But though they heard rumours that so and so was gone, they did not really know it, but each one fancied that he alone was going, and not far from Godhāvarī they all met, and alighting from their chariots, they all three mounted upon a single chariot and journeyed together to the banks of Godhāvarī.</p>
<p class="p7">At this moment Sakka, sitting on his throne of yellow marble, considered the <span class="t18">[5.73] </span>seven questions and said to himself, &ldquo;Except Sarabhaṅga, the master, there is no one else in this world or the Deva world that can answer these questions: I will ask him these questions. These three kings have come to the banks of Godhāvarī to make inquiry of Sarabhaṅga, the master. I will also consult him about the questions they ask.&rdquo; And, accompanied by deities from two of the Deva worlds, he descended from heaven.</p>
<p class="p7">That very day Kisavaccha died, and to celebrate his obsequies, innumerable bands of ascetics, who dwelt in four different places, raised a pile of sandalwood and burned his body, and in a space of half a league round about the place of his burning there fell a shower of celestial flowers. The Great Being, after seeing to the depositing of his remains, entered the hermitage and, attended by these bands of ascetics, sat down. When the kings arrived on the banks of the river there was a sound of martial music. The Great Being, on hearing it, addressed the ascetic Anusissa and said: &ldquo;Go and learn what this music means,&rdquo; and taking a bowl of drinking-water, he went there, and seeing these kings, he uttered this first verse in the form of a question:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Beringed and gallantly arrayed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All girt with jewel-hilted blade,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Halt you, great chiefs, and straight declare</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What name &rsquo;midst world of men you bear?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.137}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing his words, they alighted from the chariot and stood saluting him. Amongst them king Aṭṭhaka, falling into talk with him, spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Bhīmaratha, Kaliṅga famed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Aṭṭhaka &ndash; thus are we named &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To look on saints of life austere</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And question them, are we come here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12152"></a>Then the ascetic said to them, &ldquo;Well, sire, you have reached the place where you would fain be, therefore, after bathing take a rest, and entering the hermitage, pay your respects to the band of ascetics, and put your question to the master,&rdquo; and thus, holding friendly converse with them, he tossed up the jar of water<a id="a12153"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16686"><span class="t9">{1172}</span></a><a id="a12154"></a> and wiping up the drops that fell he looked up to the sky and beheld Sakka, the lord of heaven, surrounded by a company of gods, and descending from heaven, mounted on the back of Erāvaṇa,<a id="a12155"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16688"><span class="t9">{1173}</span></a> and conversing with him, he repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12156"></a><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;You</span><a id="a12157"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16690"><span class="t19">{1174}</span></a><span class="t12"> in mid-heaven are fixed on high</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like full-orbed moon that gilds the sky,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I ask you, mighty spirit, say</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How are you known on Earth, I pray.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.74]</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, Sakka repeated the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Sujampati in heaven proclaimed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As Maghavā on Earth is named;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This king of gods today comes here</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To see these saints of life austere.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.138}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Anusissa said to him, &ldquo;Well, sire, do you follow us,&rdquo; and taking the drinking-vessel, he entered the hermitage, and after putting away the jar of water, he announced to the Great Being that the three kings and the lord of heaven had arrived to ask him certain questions. Surrounded by a band of ascetics, Sarabhaṅga sat in a large, wide enclosed space. The three kings came, and, saluting the band of ascetics, sat down on one side. And Sakka, descending from the sky, approached the ascetics, and saluting them with folded hands, and singing their praises, repeated the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Wide known to fame this saintly band,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With mighty powers at their command:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I gladly bid you hail: in worth</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You far surpass the best on earth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did Sakka salute the band of ascetics, and guarding against the six faults in sitting, he sat apart. Then Anusissa, on seeing him seated to leeward of the ascetics, spoke the sixth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;The person of an aged saint</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is rank, the very air to taint.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Great Sakka, beat a quick retreat</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12158"></a><span class="t12">From saintly odours, none too sweet.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.139}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, Sakka repeated another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Though aged saints offend the nose</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And taint the sweetest air that blows:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12159"></a><span class="t12">The flowerets&rsquo; fragrant wreath above</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This odour of the saints we love;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In gods it may no loathing move.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And having so spoken, he added, &ldquo;Venerable Anusissa, I have made a great effort to come here and ask a question: give me leave to do so.&rdquo; And on hearing Sakka&rsquo;s words Anusissa rose from his seat, and granting him permission, he repeated a couple of verses to the company of ascetics:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Famed Maghavā, Sujampati</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ndash; Almsgiver, lord of Devas is he &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Queller of Asuras, heavenly king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Craves leave to put his questioning.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Who of the sages that are here</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Will make their subtle questions clear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For three who over men hold sway,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Sakka whom the gods obey?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.140}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the company of ascetics said: &ldquo;Venerable Anusissa, you speak as though you saw not the earth on which you <span class="t18">[5.75] </span>stand: except our teacher Sarabhaṅga, who else is competent to answer these questions?&rdquo; and so saying, they repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis Sarabhaṅga, sage and saint,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So chaste and free from lustful taint,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The teacher&rsquo;s son, well disciplined,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Solution of their doubts will find.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And so saying, the company of ascetics thus addressed Anusissa, &ldquo;Sir, do you salute the teacher in the name of the company of saints and find an opportunity to tell him of the question proposed by Sakka.&rdquo; He readily assented and, finding his opportunity, repeated another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12160"></a><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;The holy men, Kondañña,</span><a id="a12161"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16692"><span class="t19">{1175}</span></a><span class="t12"> pray</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That you would clear their doubts away;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This burden lies, as mortals hold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On men in years and wisdom old.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being, giving his consent, repeated the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;I give you leave to ask whate&rsquo;er</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You most at heart are fain to hear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I know both this world and the next;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No question leaves my mind perplexed.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.141}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka, having thus obtained his permission, put a question which he had himself prepared:</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;Sakka, to cities bountiful, that sees the truth of things,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To learn what he was fain to know, began his questionings.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">[Sakka asks:]</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;What is it one may slay outright and never more repent;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What is it one may throw away, with all good men&rsquo;s consent;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From whom should one put up with speech, however harsh it be?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This is the thing that I would have Kondañña tell to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then explaining the question, he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;Anger is what a man may slay and never more repent;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hypocrisy he throws away with all good men&rsquo;s consent;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From all he should put up with speech, however harsh it be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This form of patience, wise men say, is highest in degree.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;Rude speech from two one might with patience hear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From one&rsquo;s superior, or from a peer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But how to bear from meaner folk rude speech</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is what I fain would have Kondañña teach.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;Rude speech from betters one may take through fear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or, to avoid a quarrel, from a peer, </span><span class="t18">{5.142}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But from the mean to put up with rude speech</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is perfect patience, as the sages teach.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Verses such as these one must understand to be connected in the way of question and answer. <span class="t18">[5.76]</span></p>
<p class="p7">When he had thus spoken, Sakka said to the Great Being, &ldquo;Venerable sir, in the first instance you said: &ldquo; &lsquo;Put up with harsh speech from all; this, men say, is the highest form of patience,&rsquo; but now you say, &lsquo;Put up here with the speech of an inferior; this, men say, is the highest form of patience,&rsquo; this latter saying does not agree with your former one.&rdquo; Then the Great Being said to him, &ldquo;Sakka, this last utterance of mine is in respect of one who puts up with harsh speech, because he knows the speaker to be his inferior, but what I said first was because one cannot by merely looking on the outward form of people know for certain their condition, whether superior to oneself or not,&rdquo; and to make it clear how difficult it is by merely regarding the outward form to distinguish the condition of persons, whether inferior or not, except by means of close intercourse, he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. &ldquo;How hard it is to judge a man that&rsquo;s polished in exterior</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be he one&rsquo;s better, equal or, it may be, one&rsquo;s inferior.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The best of men pass through the world oft times in meanest form disguised;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So then bear with rough speech from all, if you, my friend, be well advised.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this Sakka full of faith begged him, saying: &ldquo;Venerable sir, declare to us the blessing to be found in this patience,&rdquo; and the Great Being repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. &ldquo;No royal force, however vast its might,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Can win so great advantage in a fight </span><span class="t18">{5.143}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As the good man by patience may secure:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Strong patience is of fiercest feuds the cure.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the Great Being had thus expounded the virtues of patience, the kings thought: &ldquo;Sakka asks his own question; he will not allow us an opportunity of putting ours.&rdquo; So seeing what their wish was he laid aside the four questions he had himself prepared and propounding their doubts he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. &ldquo;Your words are grateful to mine ear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But one thing more I fain would hear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell us the fate of Daṇḍaki</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And of his fellow-sinners three,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Destined to suffer what rebirth</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For harassing the saints on earth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being, answering his question, repeated five verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. &ldquo;Uprooted, realm and all, erewhile</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who Kisavaccha did defile,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O&rsquo;erwhelmed with fiery embers, see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In Kukkula lies Daṇḍaki.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. Who made him sport of priest and saint</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And preacher, free from sinful taint,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This Nāḷikīra trembling fell</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Into the jaws of dogs in hell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. So Ajjuna, who slew outright</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That holy, chaste, long-suffering wight, </span><span class="t18">{5.144}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Aṅgīrasa, was headlong hurled</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To tortures in a suffering world.</span><span class="t18"> [5.77]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. Who once a sinless saint did maim</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ndash; Preacher of patience was his name &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kalābu now does scorch in hell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Midst anguish sore and terrible.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. The man of wisdom that hears tell</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of tales like these or worse of hell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ne&rsquo;er &rsquo;gainst monk or brahmin does wrong</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And heaven by his right action wins.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.146}</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the Great Being had thus pointed out the places in which the four kings were reborn, the three kings were freed from all doubt. Then Sakka in propounding his remaining four questions recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. &ldquo;Your words are grateful to mine ear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But one thing more I fain would hear:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whom does the world as moral name,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And whom does it as wise proclaim?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whom does the world for pious take,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And whom does fortune ne&rsquo;er forsake?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then in answering him the Great Being repeated four verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. &ldquo;Whoso in act and word shows self-restraint,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And e&rsquo;en in thought is free from sinful taint,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor lies to serve his own base ends &ndash; the same</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All men as moral evermore proclaim.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">28. He who revolves deep questions in his mind</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet perpetrates nought cruel or unkind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Prompt with good word in season to advise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That man by all is rightly counted wise.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">29. Who grateful is for kindness once received,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And sorrow&rsquo;s need has carefully relieved,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Has proved himself a good and steadfast friend &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Him all men as a pious soul commend.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">30. The man with every gift at his command,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">True, tender, free and bountiful of hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Heart-winning, gracious, smooth of tongue withal &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fortune from such a one will never fall.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.148}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being, like as if he were causing the moon to arise in the sky, answer the four questions. Then followed the asking of the other questions and their answers.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">31. &ldquo;Your kindly words fall grateful on mine ear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But one thing further I am fain to hear:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Virtue, fair fortune, goodness, wisdom &ndash; say</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which of all these do men call best, I pray.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">32. &ldquo;Wisdom good men declare is best by far,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">E&rsquo;en as the moon eclipses every star</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Virtue, fair fortune, goodness, it is plain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All duly follow in the wise man&rsquo;s train.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">33. &ldquo;Your kindly words fall grateful on mine ear,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To gain this wisdom what is one to do,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What line of action or what course pursue?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell us what way the path of wisdom lies</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">35. The sage regards the lust of things of sense</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Midst sorrows, lust, and terrors that appal,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Calm and unmoved the sage ignores them all.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. Thus would he conquer wrong, from passion free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And cultivate a boundless generosity;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To every living creature mercy show,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And, blameless soul, to world of Brahmā go.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.149}</span></p>
<p class="p6">While the Great Being was thus still speaking of the defilements of sensual desires, these three kings together with their armies got rid of the passion of sensual pleasure by means of the opposite quality. And the Great Being, becoming aware of this, by way of praising them recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. &ldquo;Bhīmaratha by power of magic came</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With you, O Aṭṭhaka, and one to fame</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As king Kaliṅga known, and now all three,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Once slaves to sensuality, are free.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.150}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, the mighty kings singing the praises of the Great Being recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis so, you reader of men&rsquo;s thoughts: all three</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of us from sensuality are free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Grant us the boon for which we are right fain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That to your happy state we may attain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being, granting them this favour, repeated another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12162"></a><span class="t12">39. &ldquo;I grant</span><a id="a12163"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16694"><span class="t19">{1176}</span></a><span class="t12"> the boon that you would have of me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The more that you from sensual vice are free:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So may you thrill with boundless joy to gain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That happy state to which you would attain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this they, signifying assent, repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">40. &ldquo;We will do everything at your behest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whate&rsquo;er you in your wisdom deem the best;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So will we thrill with boundless joy to gain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That happy state to which we would attain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then did the Great Being grant holy orders to their armies and dismissing the band of ascetics repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">41. &ldquo;Due honour lo! to Kisavaccha came;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So now depart, you saints of goodly fame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In Absorption delighting calmly rest;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12164"></a><span class="t12">This joy of holiness is far the best.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.151}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The saints, assenting to his words by bowing to him, flew up into the air and departed to their own places of abode. And Sakka rising <span class="t18">[5.79] </span>from his seat and raising his folded hands and making obeisance to the Great Being, as though he were worshipping the sun, departed together with his company.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher on seeing this repeated these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">42. &ldquo;Hearing these strains that highest truth did teach</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Set forth by holy sage in goodly speech,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The glorious beings to their heavenly home</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Once more with joy and gratitude did come.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">43. The holy sage&rsquo;s strains strike on the ear</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="t30">Thus did the Teacher bring his teaching to a climax in Arahatship and saying: &ldquo;Not only now, but formerly also, there was a rain of flowers at the burning of the body of Mogallāna,&rdquo; he revealed the Truths and identified the Jātaka, </span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Then mighty Sakka.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.152}</span><a id="a12180"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher, while residing at Jetavana, told about the temptation of a monk by the wife of his unregenerate days. The subject-matter of the tale is related in full in the Indriyajātaka [Ja 423].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The story is that a young man of good family at Sāvatthi heard the Teacher&rsquo;s preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymen&rsquo;s houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. He took what he had got to the wife he had left: she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. &ldquo;Salute him and bid him pass on.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, &ldquo;This is the father of my sons.&rdquo; She came out and saluted him: taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food: when he had eaten she saluted again and said: &ldquo;Sir, you are a saint now: we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householder&rsquo;s life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country: be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.&rdquo; For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: &ldquo;I cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life; send a layman&rsquo;s garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.&rdquo; She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now the Teacher asked the monk, &ldquo;Is it true, monk, that you were rendered discontented?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true, venerable sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; &ldquo;By my wife of former days.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monk,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this woman wrought mischief for you: it was owing to her that you fell away from Absorption, and lay for three years in a lost and distracted condition, and on the recovery of your senses you uttered a great lamentation,&rdquo; and so saying he told him a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, in the reign of Brahmadatta in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born of a brahmin family in the kingdom of Kāsi, and when of age he became proficient in all liberal arts, and adopting the ascetic life he lived on wild berries and roots in a forest home. Now a certain doe in the brahmin&rsquo;s toileting place ate grass and drank water mingled with his semen, and was so much enamoured of him that she became pregnant and henceforth ever resorted to the spot near the hermitage. The Great Being examining into the matter learned the facts of the case. By and by the doe gave birth to a man child, and the Great <span class="t18">[5.80]</span><a id="a12181"></a> Being watched over him with a father&rsquo;s affection. And his name was Isisiṅga.<a id="a12182"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16700"><span class="t9">{1179}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">And when the lad reached years of discretion, he admitted him to holy orders, and when he himself grew an old man, he repaired with him to the Nāri grove and thus admonished him, &ldquo;My dear boy, in this Himālayan country are women as fair as these flowers, they bring utter destruction on all that fall into their power, you must not come under their sway.&rdquo; And shortly afterwards he became destined to birth in the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7">But Isisiṅga, indulging in Absorption, made his dwelling in the Himālayas region, a grim ascetic, with all his senses mortified. So by the power of his virtue the abode of Sakka was shaken. Sakka, on reflection, discovered the cause and thinking: &ldquo;This fellow will bring me down from my position as Sakka, I will send a heavenly nymph to make a breach in his virtue,&rdquo; and after examining the whole angel world, amongst twenty-five millions of handmaids, save and except the nymph Alambusā, he found no other that was equal to the task. So summoning her, he bade her bring about the destruction of the saint&rsquo;s virtue.<span class="t18"> {5.153}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, in explanation of this matter, uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Then mighty Sakka, lord of lords, the god that Vatra slew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To his hall the Devakaññā called, for well her wiles he knew.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. And Fair Alambusā, he cried, the Deva host above</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12183"></a><span class="t12">To the rishi bid you go, to tempt him with your love.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka ordered Alambusā, saying: &ldquo;Go and draw nigh to Isisiṅga, and bringing him under your power destroy his virtue,&rdquo; and he uttered these words:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Go, Temptress, ever dog his steps, for holy sage is he,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And, seeking ever highest bliss, still triumphs over me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this Alambusā repeated a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Why, king of gods, of all </span><span class="t12">Accharā </span><span class="t12">regard me alone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And bid me to tempt the rishi that menaces your throne?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12184"></a><span class="t12">5. In griefless grove of Nandana is many a nymph divine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To one of them &ndash; it is their turn &ndash; the hateful task assign.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.154}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka repeated three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;You speakest truth; in griefless grove of Nandana, I ween,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May many a nymph, to rival you in loveliness, be seen.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. But none like you, O peerless maid, with all a woman&rsquo;s wile</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This holy man in folly&rsquo;s ways so practised to beguile.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. Then queen of women as you are, go, lovely nymph, your way</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And by the power of beauty force the saint to own your sway.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [5.81]</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this Alambusā repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;I will not fail, O Deva-king, to go at your behest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But still with fear this sage austere I venture to molest.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. For many a one, poor fool, has gone (I shudder at the thought)</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In hell to rue the suffering due to wrongs on saints he wrought.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">These verses were spoken after Fully Awakening:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;This said, Alambusā, </span><span class="t12">Accharā</span><span class="t12">, departed with speed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Famed Isisiṅga to entice to some unholy deed. </span><span class="t18">{5.155}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. Into the grove for half a league with berries red so bright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The grove where Isisiṅga dwelt, she vanished out of sight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. At break of day, ere yet the sun was scarce astir on high,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To Isisiṅga, sweeping out his cell, the nymph drew nigh.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the ascetic questioned her and said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;Who are you, like to lightning flash, or bright as morning star,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With ears and hands bedecked with gems that sparkle from afar?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. Fragrant as golden sandalwood, in brightness like the sun,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A slim and winsome maid are you, right fair to look upon.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. So soft and pure, with slender waist and firmly springing gait,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your movements are so full of grace, my heart they captivate.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. Your thighs, like trunk of elephant, are finely tapering found,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your buttocks soft to touch and like to any dice-board round.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. With down like lotus filaments your navel marked, I ween,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. Twin milky breasts, like pumpkins halved, their swelling globes display,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. Your lips are red as is your tongue, and, O auspicious sign,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12185"></a><span class="t12">Your neck long as the antelope&rsquo;s is marked with triple line.</span><a id="a12186"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16702"><span class="t19">{1180}</span></a><span class="t18"> {5.156}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. Your teeth brushed with a piece of wood, kept ever clean and bright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gleam in your top and lower jaw with flash of purest white.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. Your eyes are long and large of shape, a lovely sight to view,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like guñjā berries black, marked out with lines of reddish hue.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. Your hair is smooth, not over long and bound in neatest coil,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is tipped with gold and perfumed with the finest sandal oil.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. Of all that live by merchandise, by herds or by the plough,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of all the mighty saints that live true to ascetic vow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. Amongst them all in this wide world your peer I may not see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then what your name and who your sire, we fain would learn from thee.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.157}</span></p>
<p class="p6">While the ascetic thus sang the praises of Alambusā, from her feet to the hair of her head, she remained silent, and from his long drawn out speech observing how disturbed was his state of mind she repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12187"></a><span class="t12">26. &ldquo;Heaven bless you, Kassapa,</span><a id="a12188"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16704"><span class="t19">{1181}</span></a><span class="t12"> my friend, the time is past and gone</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For idle questions such as these &ndash; for are we not alone?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come let us in your hermitage embracing haste to prove</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The thousand joys well known to all the votaries of love.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.82]</span></p>
<p class="p6">So saying Alambusā thought: &ldquo;If I stand still, he will not come within reach of me; I will make as if I were running away,&rdquo; and with all the cunning of a woman&rsquo;s wiles she shook the purpose of the ascetic, as she fled in the direction from which she had approached him.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. &ldquo;This said, Alambusā, </span><span class="t12">Accharā</span><span class="t12">, departed with speed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Famed Isisiṅga to entice to some unholy deed.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.158}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the ascetic, on seeing her depart, cried, &ldquo;She is off,&rdquo; and by a swift movement on his part he intercepted her as she was slowly making off and with his hand seized her by the hair of her head.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">28. &ldquo;To check her flight, the holy man with motion swift as air</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In hot pursuit o&rsquo;ertook the nymph and held her by the hair.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">29. Just where he stood the lovely maid embraced him in her arms,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And straight his virtue fell before the magic of her charms.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">30. In thought she flew to Sakka&rsquo;s throne in Nandana afar;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The god at once divined her wish and sent a golden car,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">31. With trappings spread and all adorned with manifold array:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And there the saint lay in her arms for many a long day.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">32. Three years passed o&rsquo;er his head as though it were a moment&rsquo;s space,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Until at last the holy man woke up from her embrace.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">33. Green trees he saw on every side; an altar stood nearby,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And verdant groves re-echoing to the loud cuckoo cry.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">34. He looked around and weeping sore he shed a bitter tear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;I make no offering, raise no hymn; no sacrifice is here.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">35. Dwelling within this forest lone, who can my tempter be?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who by foul practice has o&rsquo;ercome all sense of right in me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">E&rsquo;en as a ship with precious freight is swallowed in the sea?&rsquo; &rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.159}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this Alambusā thought: &ldquo;Should I not tell him, he will curse me; verily, I will tell him,&rdquo; and standing by him in a visible form she repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. &ldquo;Sent by king Sakka, here I stand</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A willing slave at your command;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though far too careless to know this,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas thought of me that marred your bliss.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing her words he called to mind his father&rsquo;s admonition, and lamenting how he was utterly ruined by disobeying the words of his father he repeated four verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. &ldquo;Thus would kind Kassapa, my sire,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With prudence heedless youth inspire:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Women are fair as lotus flower,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beware, good youth, their subtle power. </span><span class="t18">[5.83]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. Of woman&rsquo;s budding charms beware,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beware the danger that lurks there.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas thus my sire, by pity moved,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Would fain have warned the son he loved. </span><span class="t18">{5.160}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">39. My wise old father&rsquo;s words, alas,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unheeded I allowed to pass,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And so alone, in sore distress</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I haunt today this wilderness.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">40. Accursed be the life of old,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Henceforth I&rsquo;ll do as I am told.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Far better death itself to face,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Than be again in such a case.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So he forsook sensual desire and entered upon Absorption. Then Alambusā, seeing his virtue as an ascetic and aware that he had attained to a state of Absorption, became terrified and asked his forgiveness.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">41. &ldquo;Alambusā no sooner knew</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His steadfast power and courage true</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Than bending low, the sage to greet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The nymph straightway embraced his feet.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">42. &lsquo;O saint, all anger lay aside,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A mighty work I wrought,&rsquo; she cried,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;When heaven itself and gods of fame</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Trembled with fear to hear your name.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then he let her go, saying: &ldquo;I pardon you, fair lady; go, as you will.&rdquo; And he repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">43. &ldquo;My blessing on the Thirty-Three</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Vāsava, their lord, and thee:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Depart, fair maid, for you are free.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Saluting him she departed to the abode of the gods in that same golden carriage.<span class="t18"> {5.161}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, repeated three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">44. &ldquo;Embracing then the sage&rsquo;s feet and circling to the right,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With hands in suppliant attitude, she vanished from his sight,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">45. And mounting on the golden car, with trappings rich o&rsquo;erspread,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All splendidly caparisoned, to heavenly heights she sped.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">46. Like blazing torch or lightning flash, she passed across the sky,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Sakka, glad at heart, exclaimed, &lsquo;No boon can I deny.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [5.84]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Receiving a boon from him she repeated the concluding verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">47. &ldquo;If Sakka, King of the Devas, you would my heart&rsquo;s desire allow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let me ne&rsquo;er tempt a saint again to violate his vow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">The Teacher here ended his lesson to that monk and revealed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths that monk was established in the Fruit of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time Alambusā was the wife of his unregenerate days, Isisiṅga was the discontented monk, and the great saint his father was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
