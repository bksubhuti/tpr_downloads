<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk thinks to return to the lay life because of his attraction to his former wife. The Buddha tells a story of how Sakka feared one holy ascetic would displace him, and so sent a drought on the country and then told the king to send his daughter to break the ascetic&rsquo;s virtue, which she did. When his father returned and admonished him he regained his Super Knowledges.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the (ascetic) father (pitā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the dissatisfied monk = (his son, the seer) Isisiṅga,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a12253"></a><a id="a12254"></a><a id="a12255"></a><span class="t15">his former wife = (the king&rsquo;s daughter) Naḷinikā.</span></p>

<p class="p3">The following translation is by Ānandajoti Bhikkhu</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12258"></a><span class="t30">&ldquo;</span><span class="t33">The country is dried up.</span><a id="a12259"></a><span class="t30">&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.193}</span><span class="t30"> Now while the Teacher was living in Jeta&rsquo;s Wood he told this about the seductions of a former wife. And in regard to this story, he asked the monk what was the cause of his dissatisfaction, and he said: &ldquo;It is because of my former wife.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12260"></a><span class="t30">&ldquo;Monk, this one has been unbeneficial to you in the past also, and having lost the absorptions because of her, you came to a great calamity,&rdquo; and after saying that he told a story about the past. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12261"></a>In the past, when king Brahmadatta was ruling in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a noble and wealthy brahmin family, and when he came of age he learned a craft.</p>
<p class="p7">Later, after going-forth in the seer&rsquo;s ordination and attaining the absorptions and deep knowledges, he made his dwelling in the area of the Himālayas.<a id="a12262"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16724"><span class="t9">{1191}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12263"></a><span class="t11">Then at the place where the seer was urinating, one deer ate grass mixed with semen and drank the water. So much was her mind bound to him that, when she became pregnant, after going somewhere and eating the grass there, she wandered around in the neighbourhood of his hermitage. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The Great Being after examining the facts understood the reason. Afterwards she gave birth to a human boy. The Great Being brought him up with a father&rsquo;s love,</span><a id="a12264"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16726"><span class="t24">{1192}</span></a><span class="t11"> and named him Isisiṅga, the Seer&rsquo;s Horn. </span></p>
<p class="p7">Now when he had come of age his father gave him the going-forth and taught him the preliminary meditation exercise.<a id="a12265"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16728"><span class="t9">{1193}</span></a> In no long time, he attained the absorptions and the deep knowledges and amused himself with the bliss of absorption, and had awful power and great resolve.</p>
<p class="p7">Because of the power of his virtue Sakka&rsquo;s dwelling place shook. Reflecting, Sakka knew the reason for it, and thinking: I will break his virtue through some means or other, for three long years he prevented rain in the whole kingdom of Kāsī, until the kingdom was as though burnt by fire.</p>
<p class="p7">With an unsuccessful harvest the people became oppressed by famine, and they blamed it on the impurity of the king. Then they stood at the king&rsquo;s window and asked: Why is this? saying: &ldquo;Great king, <span class="t18">{5.194}</span> for three years the sky-god hasn&rsquo;t rained, and the whole kingdom is dried up, people are suffering, make the sky-god rain, king.&rdquo;<a id="a12266"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16730"><span class="t9">{1194}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">The king established the virtuous practices and maintained the fast-day, but was still unable to make the rain fall down. </p>
<p class="p7">Then in the middle of the night, Sakka entered and illuminated the royal chamber, and stood in the air. The king, having seen him, asked: </p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I am Sakka,&rdquo; </p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What have you come for?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Does the sky-god rain on your kingdom, great king?&rdquo; </p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But do you know the reason for it not raining?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Great king, in the area of the Himālayas lives an ascetic named Isisiṅga who has awful power and great resolve. When the sky-god rains regularly he becomes angry and glares at the sky, therefore the sky-god does not rain.&rdquo;<a id="a12267"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16732"><span class="t9">{1195}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But now what is to be done in this case?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;When his power is broken, the sky-god will rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But who is able to break his power?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Your daughter, great king, Naḷinikā is able. After summoning her, send her to him saying: After going to such and such a place, break the ascetic&rsquo;s power.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="p7">Then, after advising the king, he returned to his own place in Heaven.</p>
<p class="p7">The king on the following day discussed it with his ministers, and summoning his daughter, he spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;The country is dried up, and the kingdom will be destroyed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come, Naḷinikā, do you go and bring the brahmin for me.&rdquo;</span><a id="a12268"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16734"><span class="t19">{1196}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">Having heard that, she spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;I cannot bear suffering, king, and I have no skill in roads,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How will I go through a wood inhabited by elephants?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the King spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;You can go through this prosperous country with an elephant and a chariot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And with a wooden raft - you can go like this, Naḷinikā. </span><span class="t18">{5.195}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12269"></a><span class="t12">4. Go and take with you elephants, horses, soldiers and nobles,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By your beauteous form you will bring him under your control.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus he spoke with his daughter about what shouldn&rsquo;t be spoken of in order to protect his kingdom. She accepted the proposition saying: It is good.</p>
<p class="p7">Then having given her all she required, he sent her off with the ministers. The ministers took her and arrived at the borderlands and set up the camp there, and having the king&rsquo;s daughter taken up they entered the Himālayas with a forester who knew the path, and in the morning-time arrived near to the area of the seer&rsquo;s hermitage.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time the Buddha-to-be left his son behind in the hermitage, and had himself entered the wilds looking for various kinds of fruit.</p>
<p class="p7">The forester approached his hermitage, and standing near that lovely place, pointed it out and spoke two verses to Naḷinikā:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Marked by the sign of the plantain, surrounded by the Himālayan birch,</span><a id="a12270"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16736"><span class="t19">{1197}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here is seen Isisiṅga&rsquo;s delightful hermitage.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Here is seen the smoke of a fire,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I think it is emitted from the very powerful Isisiṅga&rsquo;s sacred fire.</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the Bodhisatta entered the wilds, the ministers surrounded the hermitage and stood guard over it, then they made the king&rsquo;s daughter take the guise of a seer, <span class="t18">{5.196} </span>fully clothed with a golden bark-robe, and decorating her with all decorations, made her take a pretty yo-yo fastened with a string, and sent her to the hermitage, while they themselves stood outside keeping guard. Amusing herself with the yo-yo she entered the end of the walking path. </p>
<p class="p7">At that time Isisiṅga was sitting on a stone bench at the door of the leaf-hut. Seeing her coming he rose in fear and trembling, and entering the leaf-hut, he stood inside. After going to the door of the leaf-hut she amused herself nearby. </p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher explaining the meaning further spoke three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Having seen her coming, adorned with jewelled earrings,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Isisiṅga fearfully entered the leaf-covered hermitage.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. She amused herself with her yo-yo at the door of the hermitage,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Revealing her limbs, she displayed her secret parts.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. After seeing the yogini amusing herself with the yo-yo at the leaf-hut, </span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And coming forth from the hermitage, he spoke these words:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &lsquo;Hey! What is the name of the tree such a fruit comes from?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Having thrown it afar it returns, it doesn&rsquo;t go away from you.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then she spoke this verse about the trees:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;My hermitage, holy sir, is close to Gandhamādana,</span><a id="a12271"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16738"><span class="t19">{1198}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There are trees on the mountain that such a fruit comes from,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Having thrown it afar it returns, it doesn&rsquo;t go away from me.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.197}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus she spoke a falsehood.</p>
<p class="p7">Having faith, and thinking: This is an ascetic, he made a friendly welcome and spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;Come, good sir, eat in this hermitage,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Receive what I can give of foot-oil and food,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Please sit, good sir, here in this hermitage,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eat, good Sir, the roots and fruits.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">She entered the leaf-hut and while sitting on the reed mat her golden bark-robe fell in two and her body was uncovered. The ascetic, having never before seen a woman&rsquo;s body, thinking: This is a wound, said this:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;What is this in between your thighs</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">It appears so dark and slippery,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Declare to me that which I ask about,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why is it your genitals enter into a cavity?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then deceiving him she spoke this pair of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;While I was roaming in the woods is search of roots and fruits,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I came across a bear, very fierce in appearance, </span><span class="t18">{5.198}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He ran up and fell upon me with violence,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He pushed me down and pulled off my penis.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. This wound is therefore itching and irritating,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I do not receive any comfort at any time,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You are able, good sir, to remove this itch,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When asked, dear sir, please do this good thing for a brahmin. </span></p>
<p class="p6">Believing the lies about her condition, thinking: If I can make you happy in this way, having looked at the area, he spoke the next verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;Your wound appears to be deep and red,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12272"></a><span class="t12">It is big, fresh and smells like it&rsquo;s decaying,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will make you some remedial decoction,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like that, good sir, you will be at perfect ease.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After that Naḷinikā spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;Not through a charm-remedy, or a remedial decoction,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor through medicine, holy one, will the itch go away, </span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Please remove the itch gently with your penis,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like that I will come to be at perfect ease.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.199}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thinking: This is the truth he speaks, not knowing that through engaging in sexual intercourse virtue is broken, and the absorptions are lost, being ignorant and having never seen a woman before, because she spoke of medicine, he engaged in sexual intercourse with her.</p>
<p class="p7">Then his virtue was broken and his absorptions were lost.</p>
<p class="p7">After having sexual intercourse two or three times, they became tired and left the leaf-hut and descended into the lake and washed themselves. Having eased his fatigue and sitting again in the leaf-hut, still thinking: This is an ascetic, he asked about her residence and spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. &ldquo;From here, good sir, where is your hermitage?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do you, good sir, take delight in the wilds?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do you have abundant roots and fruits?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do you, good sir, not risk injury from predators?</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Naḷinikā spoke four verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. &ldquo;From here straight in the northerly direction.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The river Khemā moves through the Himālayas ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On the bank of that river is my delightful hermitage,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you like, good sir, you can come and see my hermitage.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. Mango, sal, plum, and jambolan trees,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The cassia, and the blossoming trumpet-flower tree, </span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All around the bird-men sing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you like, good sir, you can come and see my hermitage.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. There are palmyra and roots and fruits for me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12273"></a><a id="a12274"></a><span class="t12">Well-endowed with beauty and good scent, </span><span class="t18">{5.200}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That portion of the land is indeed well-endowed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you like, good sir, you can come and see my hermitage.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. Abundant roots and fruits are there,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Endowed with beauty, scent and taste,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But when hunters come to that district I say:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do not take from here my roots and fruits.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Having heard that, the ascetic, wanting to wait until his father had returned, spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. &ldquo;My father has gone searching for roots and fruits,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He will return here at evening time,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We both can go to your hermitage then,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">After father has come back from collecting roots and fruits.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Because of that she thought: &ldquo;Having grown up just in this monastery he doesn&rsquo;t know my femininity, but his father, after seeing me, understanding, and saying: What did you do here? and hitting me with his carrying pole, will break my head. Therefore before he comes it is good for me to go, my work in coming here is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Telling him the way to come to her, she spoke the next verse: <span class="t18">{5.201}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. &ldquo;There are many other well-disposed sages,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Royal sages, living along the road, </span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Please ask them about my hermitage,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They will guide you to my neighbourhood.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then making her getaway and leaving the hermitage, she said to him: You wait (here), and she went back to the road she had arrived on with the ministers. Then after taking her back to the camp, they eventually reached Benares.</p>
<p class="p7">Sakka was satisfied that day and made the sky-god rain down on the whole of the kingdom, and because of that there was plenty of food in the country. </p>
<p class="p7">After she had left, the ascetic Isisiṅga&rsquo;s body developed a fever. Trembling he entered the leaf-hut and covered himself with his bark cloth and lay down grieving.</p>
<p class="p7">After coming in the evening the Bodhisatta, not seeing his son, said: Where has he gone? And after putting down his carrying pole and entering the leaf-hut, he saw him lying there and said: &ldquo;Dear, what has happened?&rdquo; and while rubbing his back, he spoke three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. &ldquo;You have not broken firewood, you have not brought the water,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You have not attended to the fire, what are you thinking of, lazy one?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. Broken firewood and the sacrificial fire,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You, an ascetic, peacefully living the Holy life,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Preparing my stool and setting up water -</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Previously you delighted in excellence.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. But now you have not broken firewood, you have not brought the water,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You have neglected the fire, and the food is not ready,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And today you do not converse with me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why are you wasting away and suffering? </span><span class="t18">{5.202}</span></p>
<p class="p6">After hearing his father&rsquo;s words, he spoke about the reason:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">28. &ldquo;There came here a yogi, a holy one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12275"></a><span class="t12">Very beautiful, slender, he leads,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Neither too tall nor too short,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That venerable one had very black hair.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">29. Being beardless and youthful,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On his neck was something shaped like our support bowl,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With two bumps on his blessed chest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like resplendent golden globules.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">30. His face was very beautiful,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Having ears hanging down with curled tips,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which glittered when that youth walked around,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As did the well-fastened bun of locks on his head.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">31. Also he had four fastenings,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Blue, yellow, red and white,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12276"></a><span class="t12">Which flew about when that youth walked around,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like a flock of parrots in the rainy season.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">32. He does not wear a girdle made of grass,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">It is no normal covering for the ascetic, </span><span class="t18">{5.203}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">It glitters, while clinging between his buttocks, </span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like flashes of lightning in the firmament.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">33. Without thistles and without stalks,</span><a id="a12277"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16740"><span class="t19">{1199}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beneath the navel, around his waist,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Without striking them they always play,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dear Father, the fruit of what tree are these?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">34. His locks are very beautiful,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Having many sweet-smelling curls on top,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The two sides of his head were divided in a lovely fashion,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Oh, that my locks might be like that!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">35. But when his locks fall down,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They are endowed with a beautiful scent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like a blue lotus pervading the wind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So this hermitage is perfumed by his hair.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. Even the dust of his body is very beautiful,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The dust on my body is not of such a kind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He emits a perfume bestirred by the wind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like a blossoming wood at the height of the hot season.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. He throws the fruit of a tree upon the earth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Having a good form, pleasant and beautiful,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thrown it comes back to his hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dear Father, what sort of fruit is that?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. His teeth are very beautiful,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pure, even and like noble pearls,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They gladden the mind when uncovered,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Does he not eat vegetables with them?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">39. Smooth, flowing, swift and soft,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Straight, not haughty or fickle was his speech, </span><span class="t18">{5.204}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His cry was pleasant like the sweet sound of the cuckoo,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Stirring the heart, it surely delights my mind.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">40. A full sound, not speaking too much,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Surely not applied to study of the texts,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I desire to see him again and again,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That young man, whom I called my friend.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">41. He had a wound that was very smooth of all sides,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Broad, well-made, looking like a wet leaf,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With that the youth, having covered me over,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pressed down his open thighs with his buttocks.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">42. Shining, bedazzling and illuminating,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like flashes of lightning in the firmament.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His soft arms had glossy down,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His beautiful round fingers were resplendent.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">43. Having smooth limbs, and short bodily hair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His long fingernails were red at the tips,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Embracing me with his soft arms,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beautiful, delighting, he attended to me.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">44. Like the cotton of trees, resplendent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Having very golden palms, round and beautiful skin,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Having been touched by those soft hands,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though he has gone from here, Father, they still torment me.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">45. He surely did not carry a pole and basket, </span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He surely did not break his firewood,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He surely did not cut down a tree with an axe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There were no callouses on his hands.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">46. A bear had caused his wound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He said to me: please make me happy, </span><span class="t18">{5.205}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What I did for him was my pleasure,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And he said: I am happy, pious one.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">47. This rug made with creeper leaves</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12278"></a><span class="t12">Is scattered all about by me and by him.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then weary, after delighting in the water,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We ran back again to the leaf-hut.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12279"></a><span class="t12">48. Father, today we did not recite the mantras,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor offer the fire-sacrifice, nor the extended sacrifice,</span><a id="a12280"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16742"><span class="t19">{1200}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor can I eat those roots and fruits,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Until I see that Holy One again.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">49. For sure you will know, Father,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In what place that holy one lives,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let me go quickly to that place, Father,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do not let me die in your hermitage!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">50. The wood has beautiful blossoms, I have heard,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Resounding with birds, inhabited by flocks of birds,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let me go quickly to that wood, father,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Before I forsake my life in this hermitage.</span></p>
<p class="p6">After hearing the nonsense of that nonsensical child, the Great Being, knowing: His virtue will be broken by this woman, advised him with six verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">51. &ldquo;In this resplendent wood,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Inhabited by heavenly musicians, gods and angels, </span><span class="t18">{5.208}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where the sages are always dwelling,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You must not become discontent.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">52. Some are friends, and then some are not,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They have love for your relatives and friends,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But this one is contemptible: he who does not know, </span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12281"></a><span class="t12">For whom there should be devotion, or from whence he came.</span><a id="a12282"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16744"><span class="t19">{1201}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">53. Through living together friends are connected again and again,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That friend who is not met with, through non-association is destroyed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">54. If you will see this holy one again,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you will talk with this holy one again,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Just as a successful harvest by the great waters,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So this ascetic virtue will be quickly taken away.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">55. If you will see this holy one again,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you will talk with this holy one again,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Just as a successful harvest by the great waters,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So this power will be quickly taken away.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">56. There are beings, dear, living in this</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">World of men having different forms,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A wise man does not associate with them,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Through contact with them the holy life is destroyed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Having heard his father&rsquo;s speech, thinking: It seems she is a demoness, afraid and his mind repulsed, he made him forgive him, saying: &ldquo;Father, I will not go, forgive me.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="p7">After comforting him he said: Come, young man, develop friendliness, compassion, gladness and equanimity, and he explained the development of the (four) spiritual states. Having practiced in that way he again attained the absorptions and the deep knowledges.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After giving this Dhamma teaching, and showing the Truths, he made the connection and at the conclusion of the Truths that dissatisfied monk was established in the fruition of Stream-Entry.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Buddha said: at that time Naḷinikā was his former wife, Isisiṅga was the dissatisfied monk, and I was the Father.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Whose house is this.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><a id="a12296"></a><span class="t18">[5.107] </span><span class="t30">This story the Teacher, while residing at Jetavana, told about a discontented monk. The story tells that one day, as he was going his rounds in Sāvatthi for alms, he saw a woman of surpassing beauty, magnificently attired, and fell in love with her, and on returning home to his monastery he was unable to divert his thoughts from her. From that time, as it were, pierced with love&rsquo;s shafts and sick with desire he became as lean as a wild deer, with his veins standing out on his body, and as sallow as sallow could be. He no longer took delight in any one of the four postures, or found pleasure in his own thoughts, but giving up all the services due to a teacher he abandoned the use of instruction, inquiry and meditation.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His fellow-monks said: &ldquo;Sir, once you were calm in mind and serene of countenance, but now it is not so. </span><span class="t18">{5.210}</span><span class="t30"> What can be the cause?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I have no pleasure in anything.&rdquo; Then they bade him be happy, saying: &ldquo;To be born in the time of a Buddha is a hard matter: so also is the hearing of the True Dhamma, and the attaining to birth as a human being. But you have attained to this, and, yearning to put an end to sorrow, you left your weeping kinsfolk and becoming a believer adopted the ascetic life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Why then do you now fall under the sway of passion? These evil passions are common to all ignorant creatures, from live worms upwards, and such of these passions as are material in their origin, they too are insipid. Desires are full of sorrow and despair: misery in this case ever increases more and more. Desire is like a skeleton or a piece of meat. Desire is like a torch made of a wisp of hay or a light from embers. Desire vanishes like a dream or a loan, or the fruit of a tree. Desire is as biting as a sharp-pointed spear, or as a serpent&rsquo;s head. But you, verily, after embracing such a Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation as this and becoming an ascetic, have now fallen under the sway of such harmful passions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When by their admonitions they failed to make him grasp their teaching, they brought him before the Teacher in the Dhamma Hall. And when he said: &ldquo;Why, monks, have you brought this monk here against his will?&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;They tell us, he is discontent.&rdquo; The Teacher asked if it were true, and on his confessing that it was so, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monk, sages of old, though ruling a kingdom, whenever lust sprang up in their hearts, passed under its sway for a time, but checked their roving thoughts and were guilty of no improper conduct.&rdquo; And with these words he related a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12297"></a><a id="a12298"></a>In the past in the city of Ariṭṭhapura in the kingdom of the Sivis reigned a king named Sivi. The Bodhisatta came to life as the son of his chief queen, and they called him prince Sivi. His commander-in-chief also had a son born to him, and they named him Ahipāraka. The two boys grew up as friends and at the age of sixteen they went to Taxila, and, after completing their education, they returned home. The king made over his kingdom to his son, who appointed Ahipāraka to the post of <span class="t18">[5.108] </span>commander-in-chief, and ruled his kingdom righteously.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12299"></a><a id="a12300"></a><a id="a12301"></a>In that same city dwelt a rich merchant, named Tirīṭavaccha, worth eighty crores, and he had a daughter, a very fair and gracious lady, bearing on her person every mark of auspicious fortune, and on her naming-day she was called Ummadantī. When sixteen years old she was as beautiful as a Devaccharā, of more than mortal loveliness. All worldly people who beheld her could not contain themselves, <span class="t18">{5.211}</span> but were intoxicated with passion, as it were with strong drink, and were quite unable to recover their self-control. So her father, Tirīṭavaccha, drew near to the king and said: &ldquo;Sire, at home I have a treasure of a daughter, a fit mate even for a king. Send for your fortune-tellers, who can read the lineaments of the body, and have her tested by them and then deal with her according to your good pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king agreed and sent his brahmins, and they repaired to the merchant&rsquo;s house, and being received with great honour and hospitality partook of some rice-milk. At this moment Ummadantī came into their presence, magnificently attired. On catching sight of her they completely lost their self-control, just as if they were intoxicated with passion, and forgot that they had left their meal unfinished. Some of them took a morsel and thinking they would eat it put it on their heads. Some let it fall on their hips. Others threw it against the wall. Every one was beside himself.</p>
<p class="p7">When she saw them thus, she said: &ldquo;They tell me these fellows are to test the character of my marks,&rdquo; and she ordered them to be taken by the scruff of their neck and thrust out. And they were sorely annoyed and returned to the palace in a great rage with Ummadantī, and they said: &ldquo;Sire, this woman is no mate for you: she is a wretch.&rdquo; The king thought: &ldquo;They tell me she is a wretch,&rdquo; and he did not send for her. On hearing what had happened she said: &ldquo;I am not taken to wife by the king, because they say I am a wretch: witches forsooth are just like me. Very well, should I ever see the king, I shall know what to do.&rdquo; And she conceived a grudge against him. So her father gave her in marriage to Ahipāraka, and she was her husband&rsquo;s darling and delight.</p>
<p class="p7">Now as the result of what act of hers had she become so beautiful? By the gift of a scarlet robe. In the past, they say, she was born in a poor family in Benares and on some festal day seeing certain holy women, magnificently clad in robes dyed scarlet with safflower and disporting themselves, she told her parents that she too would like to wear a similar robe and take her pleasure. And when they said: &ldquo;My dear, we are poor people: whence are we to get you such a robe?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;suffer me to earn wages in a wealthy household, and as soon as they recognise my merit, they will make me a present of a robe.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{5.212}</span> And having gained their consent she approached a certain family and proposed to let her do service to them for a scarlet robe. They said: &ldquo;After you have worked three years for us, we will recognise your merits by giving you one.&rdquo; She <span class="t18">[5.109] </span>readily agreed, and set about her work.</p>
<p class="p7">Recognising her merit before the three years had expired, they gave her together with a thick safflower-dyed robe yet another garment, and sent her off, saying: &ldquo;Go with your companions, and, after bathing, dress yourself in these robes.&rdquo; So she went with her companions and bathed, leaving the scarlet robe on the bank. At this moment a disciple of Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, who had been robbed of his garments and had put on pieces of a broken bough to serve as outer and inner robes, arrived at this spot. On seeing him she thought: &ldquo;This holy man must have been robbed of his garment. In former times I too, from not having a robe offered to me, found it difficult to procure one,&rdquo; and she determined to divide the garment in two and give him half of it. So she went up out of the water and put on her old dress and saying: &ldquo;Stay, venerable sir,&rdquo; she saluted the elder, and tearing her robe in two gave half of it to him.</p>
<p class="p7">Then he stood on one side in a sheltered spot and, throwing away his branch-garment, he made himself with one side of the robe an inner garment and with the other side an outer garment and stepped out into the open, and his whole person by the splendour of the robe was all ablaze, like the newly-risen sun. On seeing this she thought: &ldquo;This holy man at first was not radiant, but now he shines like a newly-risen sun. I will give him this too.&rdquo; So she gave him the other half of the robe, and put up this prayer, &ldquo;Venerable sir, I would fain in some future stage of existence be of such surpassing beauty, that no one who sees me may have power to control himself, and that no other woman may he more beautiful.&rdquo; The elder returned her his thanks and went his way. After a period of transmigration in the world of gods, she was at this time born in Ariṭṭhapura and was as beautiful as she was described.</p>
<p class="p7">Now in this city they proclaimed the Kattikā festival,<a id="a12302"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16748"><span class="t9">{1203}</span></a> and on the day of full moon they decorated the city. Ahipāraka, on setting out for the post he had to guard, addressing her, said, <span class="t18">{5.213}</span> &ldquo;Lady Ummadantī, today is the Kattikā festival; the king, in marching in solemn procession round the city, will first of all come to the door of this house. Be sure you do not show yourself to him, for on seeing you he will not be able to control his thoughts.&rdquo; As he was leaving her, she said to him, &ldquo;I will see to it.&rdquo; And as soon as he was off, she gave an order to her handmaid to let her know when the king came to the door.</p>
<p class="p7">So at sunset, when the full moon had risen and torches were blazing in every quarter of the city, which was decorated as if it were some city of the gods, the king arrayed in all his splendour, mounted on a magnificent carriage drawn by thoroughbreds and escorted by a crowd of courtiers, making a circuit of the city with great pomp, came first of all to the door of Ahipāraka&rsquo;s house. Now this house, enclosed by a wall in colour like vermilion, furnished with gates and tower, was a beautiful and charming place. At this moment the maid brought her mistress <span class="t18">[5.110] </span><a id="a12303"></a>word of the king&rsquo;s arrival, and Ummadantī bade her take a basket of flowers, and standing near the window she threw the flowers over the king with all the charm of a sylph. And looking up at her the king was maddened with passion and quite unable to control his thoughts, and he failed to recognise the house as that of Ahipāraka. So addressing his charioteer, he repeated two verses in the form of a question:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Whose house is this, Sunanda, tell me true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All girt about with wall of golden hue?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What vision fair is this, like meteor bright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or sunbeam striking on some mountain height?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. A daughter of the house perchance is she,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Herself its mistress, or son&rsquo;s wife maybe?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your answer quickly in a single word &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12304"></a><span class="t12">Is she unwed,</span><a id="a12305"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16750"><span class="t19">{1204}</span></a><span class="t12"> or owns she still a lord?&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.214}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then, in answering the king, he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;All that your highness asks I know full well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And of her parents on both sides can tell:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As to her husband, night and day, O king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He serves your cause with zeal in everything.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. A powerful minister of thine is he,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vast wealth he owns and great prosperity;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She&rsquo;s wife of Ahipāraka the famed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12306"></a><span class="t12">And at her birth was Ummadantī named.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the king, in praising her name, repeated yet another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Alas, how ominous a name is here</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Given to this maiden by her parents dear;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lo! A mad haunted man I grew to be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On seeing how agitated he was she closed the window and went straight to her fair chamber. And from the moment when the king set eyes on her, he had no more thought of making solemn procession round the city. Addressing his charioteer he said: &ldquo;Friend Sunanda, stop the chariot; <span class="t18">{5.215}</span> this is not a festival suitable for us; it is fit only for Ahipāraka, my commander-in-chief, and the throne also is better suited for him,&rdquo; and stopping the chariot he climbed up to his palace and, as he lay chattering upon the royal couch, he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;A lily maid, with eyes soft as a doe&rsquo;s,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In the full moon&rsquo;s clear light before me rose,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beholding her in robe of dove-like hue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I thought two moons at once came into view.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Darting one glance from her bright, lovely eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The temptress took me captive by surprise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like Kimpurisa upon some mountain height,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Her graceful motion won my heart at sight.</span><span class="t18"> [5.111]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. So dark and tall and fair the maid, with jewels in her ears,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Clad in a single garment, like a timid doe, appears.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. With long-tressed hair and nails all stainéd red,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O&rsquo;er her soft arms rich sandal essence shed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With tapering fingers and a gracious air,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When will she smile on me, my charmer fair?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. When will Tirīṭi&rsquo;s slender-waisted maid,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A gold adornment on her breast displayed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With her soft arms embracing cling to me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">E&rsquo;en as a creeper to some forest tree?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. When will she stained with dye of lac so bright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With swelling bosom, maiden lily-white,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Exchange a kiss with me, as oft a glass</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Will from one drunkard to another pass?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. Soon as I saw her standing thus, so fair to outward view,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No longer master of myself, reason away I threw.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. When Ummadantī I beheld, with jewelled earrings bright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like one punished right heavily, I slept not day nor night.</span><span class="t18"> {5.216}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. Should Sakka grant a boon to me, my choice were quickly ta&rsquo;en,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I would be Ahipāraka one night or haply twain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Ummadantī thus enjoyed, he might o&rsquo;er Sivi reign.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then those councillors told Ahipāraka, saying: &ldquo;Teacher, the king on making a solemn procession around the city went to the door of your house <span class="t18">{5.217}</span> and then turning back climbed up to his palace.&rdquo; So Ahipāraka went home and addressing Ummadantī asked her if she had shown herself to the king. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a certain pot-bellied fellow with huge teeth, standing up in his chariot, came here. I do not know whether he was a king or a prince, but I was told he was a lord of some kind, and standing at the open window I threw flowers over him. Meanwhile he turned back and went off.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">On hearing this he said: &ldquo;You have ruined me,&rdquo; and early next morning ascending to the king&rsquo;s house he stood at the door of the royal chamber and, hearing the king rambling about Ummadantī, he thought: &ldquo;He has fallen in love with Ummadantī; if he does not get her, he will die: it is my duty to restore him to life, if it can be done without wrong on the part of the king or myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So he went home and summoned a stout-hearted cheat or a serving-man and said: &ldquo;Friend, in such and such a place is a hollow tree that is a sacred shrine. Without saying a word to anyone, go there at sunset and seat yourself inside the tree. Then I shall come and make an offering there, and in worshipping the deities I shall put up this prayer, &lsquo;O king of heaven, our king, while a festival was going on, without taking any part in it, has gone into his royal closet and lies there chattering idly; we do not know why he does so. The king has been a great benefactor of the gods and year by year has spent a thousand pieces of money in sacrifices. Tell us why the king talks thus foolishly and grant us the boon of the king&rsquo;s life.&rsquo; Thus will <span class="t18">[5.112]</span> I pray and at this moment you are to remember to repeat these words, &lsquo;O commander-in-chief, your king is not sick, but he is infatuated with your wife Ummadantī. If he shall get her, he will live; otherwise he will die. If you wish him to live, give up Ummadantī to him.&rsquo; This is what you are to say.&rdquo; And having thus schooled him he sent him away.</p>
<p class="p7">So the servant went next day and seated himself inside the tree and when the general came to the place and put up his prayer, he repeated his lesson. The general said: &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; and with an obeisance to the deity he went and told the king&rsquo;s ministers, and entering the city he climbed up to the palace and knocked at the door of the royal closet. <span class="t18">{5.218}</span> The king having recovered his senses asked who it was. &ldquo;It is I, Ahipāraka, my lord.&rdquo; Then he opened the king&rsquo;s door and going in he saluted the king and repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;While kneeling at a sacred shrine, O king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A Yakkha came and told me a strange thing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How Ummadantī had enslaved your will:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Take her and so your heart&rsquo;s desire fulfil.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the king asked, &ldquo;Friend Ahipāraka, do even the Yakkhas know that I have been talking foolishly owing to my infatuation for Ummadantī?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; he said. The king thought: &ldquo;My vileness is known throughout the world,&rdquo; and he felt ashamed. And taking his stand in righteousness he uttered another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;Fallen from grace no godhead shall I win,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And all the world will hear of my great wrong:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Think too how great your grief of mind would be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should you no more your Ummadantī see.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The remaining verses are repeated by the two alternately.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;Except thyself and me, O king, no one</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In the whole world will know the deed that&rsquo;s done:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lo! Ummadantī is my gift to you,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p6">When the king had thus been taught the Dhamma by his commander-in-chief Ahipāraka, he got rid of his infatuation for Ummadantī.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, revealed the Truths, and identified the Jātaka. At the end of the Truths the monk was established in the First Path. At that time Ānanda was the charioteer Sunanda, Sāriputta was Ahipāraka, Uppalavaṇṇā was Ummadantī, the followers of Buddha were the rest of the courtiers, and I myself was king Sivi.</span></p>

The incident will be found related in the Mahā-ummagga [Ja 546].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12330"></a><a id="a12331"></a><span class="t34">One day the monks sat in the Dhamma Hall and described the Tathāgata&rsquo;s Perfection of Wisdom, &ldquo;Monks, the Tathāgata is greatly wise, his wisdom is vast, ready, swift, sharp, crushing heretical doctrines, after having converted, by the power of his own knowledge, the brahmins Kūṭadanta and the rest, the ascetics Sabhiya and the rest, the thieves Aṅgulimāla and the rest, the Yakkhas Āḷavaka and the rest, the Devas Sakka and the rest, and the Brahmās Baka and the rest, made them humble, and ordained a vast multitude as ascetics and established them in the fruition of the paths of sanctification.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now on this occasion the Teacher said: &ldquo;Not only now, but formerly also, the Tathāgata was wise and crushed all disputants,&rdquo; and with these words he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past in the reign of Brahmadatta the Bodhisatta was born at Benares in the kingdom of Kāsi, in the family of a north brahmin magnate, worth eighty crores, and they named him young Bodhi. When he came of age, he was instructed in all learning at Taxila, and returning home he dwelt in the midst of household cares. By and by renouncing evil desires he retired to the Himālayas region <span class="t18">{5.228}</span> and took up the ascetic life of a wandering mendicant, and dwelt there for a long time, living on roots and wild berries.</p>
<p class="p7">At the rainy season he came down from the Himālayas and going on his begging rounds he gradually approached Benares. There he took up his abode in the royal park, and on the following day going his round in the city for alms, in his character of a mendicant, he drew near to the palace gate. The king standing at his window saw him, and, being delighted with his calm demeanour, he introduced him into his palace and seated him on the royal couch. After a little friendly talk, the king listened to an exposition of the Dhamma and then offered him a variety of dainty food. The Great Being accepted the food and thought: &ldquo;Verily this king&rsquo;s court is full of hatred and abounds in enemies. Who, I wonder, will rid me of a fear that has sprung up in my mind?&rdquo; And observing a tawny hound, a favourite of the king&rsquo;s, standing near him, he took a lump of food and made a show of wishing to give it to the dog. The king being aware of this had the dog&rsquo;s dish brought and bade him take the food and give it to the dog. The Great Being did so and then finished his own meal. And the king, gaining his consent to the arrangement, had a hut of leaves built for him in the royal park within the city, and, assigning to him all that an ascetic required, he let him dwell there. And two or three times every day the king came to pay his respects to him. And at meal times the Great Being continued to <span class="t18">[5.117] </span>sit on the royal couch and to share the royal food. And so twelve years passed.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12332"></a>Now the king had five councillors who taught him his temporal and spiritual duties. One of them denied the existence of causation (kamma). Another believed everything was the act of a Supreme Being. A third professed the Dhamma of things happening owing to previous actions. A fourth believed in annihilation at death. A fifth held the Khattiya Dhamma. He who denied causation taught the people that beings in this world were purified by rebirth. He who believed in the action of a Supreme Being taught that the world was created by him. He who believed in the consequences of previous acts taught that sorrow or joy that befalls man here is the result of some previous action. The believer in annihilation taught that no one passes hence to another world, but that this world is annihilated. He who professed the Khattiya creed taught that one&rsquo;s own interest is to be desired even at the cost of killing one&rsquo;s parents.</p>
<p class="p7">These men were appointed to sit in judgment in the king&rsquo;s court, <span class="t18">{5.229}</span><a id="a12333"></a> and being greedy of bribes they dispossessed the rightful owner of property. Now one day a certain man, being worsted in a false action at law, saw the Great Being go into the palace for alms, and he saluted him and poured his grievance into his ears, saying: &ldquo;Venerable sir, why do you, who take your meals in the king&rsquo;s palace, regard with indifference<a id="a12334"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16761"><span class="t9">{1208}</span></a> the action of his lord justices who by taking bribes ruin all men? Just now these five councillors, taking a bribe at the hands of a man who brought a false action, have wrongfully dispossessed me of my property.&rdquo; So the Great Being moved by pity for him went to the court, and giving a righteous judgment reinstated him in his property.</p>
<p class="p7">The people with one consent loudly applauded his action. The king hearing the noise asked what it meant, and on being told what it was, when the Great Being had finished his meal, he took a seat beside him and asked, &ldquo;Is it true, venerable sir, as they say, that you have decided a lawsuit?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true, sire.&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;It will be to the advantage of the people, if you decide cases: henceforth you are to sit in judgment.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;we are ascetics; this is not our business.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, you ought to do it in pity to the people. You need not judge the whole day, but when you come here from the park, go at early dawn to the place of judgment and decide four cases; then return to the park and after partaking of food decide four more cases, and in this way the people will derive benefit.&rdquo; After being repeatedly importuned, he agreed to it and henceforth he acted accordingly.</p>
<p class="p7">Those who brought fraudulent actions found no further opportunity, and the councillors not getting any bribes were in evil plight and thought: &ldquo;Ever since this mendicant Bodhi began to sit in judgment, we get nothing at all.&rdquo; And calling him the king&rsquo;s enemy they said: &ldquo;Come, let us slander him to the king and bring about his death.&rdquo; So drawing nigh to the king they said, <span class="t18">[5.118]</span> &ldquo;Sire, the mendicant Bodhi wishes you harm.&rdquo; The king did not believe them and said: &ldquo;Nay, he is a good and learned man; he would not do so.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;all the citizens are his creatures: <span class="t18">{5.230}</span> we are the only five people he cannot get under his thumb. If you do not believe us, when he next comes here, take note of his following.&rdquo; The king agreed to do so, and standing at his window he watched for his coming, and, seeing the crowd of suitors who followed Bodhi without his knowledge, the king thought they were his retinue, and being prejudiced against him he summoned his councillors and asked, &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Have him arrested, sire,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Unless we see some gross offence on his part,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how are we to arrest him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then diminish the honour that is usually paid to him, and when he sees this falling off of respect, being a wise mendicant, he will without saying a word to anyone run away of his own accord.&rdquo; The king fell in with this suggestion and gradually diminished the respect paid to him.</p>
<p class="p7">On the first day after this they seated him on a bare couch. He noticed it and at once knew that he had been slandered to the king, and returning to the park he was minded to take his departure that very day, but he thought: &ldquo;When I know for certain, I will depart,&rdquo; and he did not go away. So the next day when he was seated on the bare couch, they came with food prepared for the king and other food as well, and gave him a mixture of the two. On the third day they did not suffer him to approach the dais, but placing him at the head of the stairs they offered him mixed food. He took it and retiring to the park made his meal there. On the fourth day they placed him on the terrace below and gave him broth made of rice dust, and this too he took to the park and made his meal there.</p>
<p class="p7">The king said: &ldquo;Though the honours paid to him are diminished, yet Great Bodhi, the mendicant, does not go away. What are we to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;it is not for alms he comes here; but he is seeking sovereignty. If he were coming merely for the alms, he would have run away the very first day he was slighted.&rdquo; &ldquo;What then are we to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Have him slain tomorrow, sire.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; and placing swords in the hands of these very men he said: &ldquo;Tomorrow, when he comes and stands inside the door, cut off his head and make mincemeat of him, and without saying a word to anyone throw his body on a dunghill, and then take a bath and return here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">They readily agreed and said: &ldquo;Tomorrow we will come and do so,&rdquo; <span class="t18">{5.231}</span> and having arranged matters with one another they departed to their several homes. The king too after his evening meal lay down on the royal couch and called to mind the virtues of the Great Being. Then straightaway sorrow fell upon him and the sweat poured from his body, and getting no comfort in his bed he rolled about from side to side. Now his chief queen lay beside him but he exchanged not a single word with her.<span class="t18"> [5.119]</span></p>
<p class="p7">So she asked him, saying: &ldquo;How is it, sire, that you do not say a word to me? Have I in any way offended you?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but they tell me the mendicant Bodhi has become an enemy of ours. I have ordered five of my councillors to slay him tomorrow. After killing him they will cut him in pieces and cast his body on a dunghill. But for twelve years he has taught us many a truth. No single offence in him has ever been clearly seen by me before, but at the instigation of others I have ordered him to be put to death, and this is why I grieve.&rdquo; Then she comforted him, saying: &ldquo;If, sire, he is your enemy, why do you grieve at killing him? Your own safety must be attended to, even if the enemy you slay is your own son. Do not take it to heart.&rdquo; He was reassured by her words and fell asleep.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12335"></a>At that moment the well-bred tawny hound hearing the talk thought: &ldquo;Tomorrow by my own power I must save this man&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; So early next morning the dog went down from the terrace and coming to the big door he lay with his head on the threshold, watching the road by which the Great Being came. But those councillors with swords in their hands came early in the morning and took their stand inside the door. And Bodhi duly observing the time came from the park and approached the palace door. Then the hound seeing him opened his mouth and showed his four big teeth and thought: &ldquo;Why, venerable sir, do you not seek your alms elsewhere in Jambudīpa? Our king has posted five councillors armed with swords inside the door to slay you. Do not come accepting death as your fate,<a id="a12336"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16763"><span class="t9">{1209}</span></a> but be off with all speed,&rdquo; and he gave a loud bark.</p>
<p class="p7">From his knowledge of the meaning of all sounds Bodhi understood the matter and returned to the park <span class="t18">{5.232}</span> and took everything that was necessary for his journey. But the king standing at his window, when he found he was not coming, thought: &ldquo;If this man is my enemy, he will return to the park and gather together all his forces and will be prepared for action, but if otherwise, he will certainly take all that he requires and be ready to go away. I will find out what he is about.&rdquo; And going to the park he found the Great Being coming out of his hut of leaves and with all his requisites at the end of his cloister walk, ready to start, and saluting him he stood on one side and uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;What mean these things, umbrella, shoes, skin-robe and staff in hand?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What of this cloak and bowl and hook? I fain would understand</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why in hot haste you would depart and to what far-off land.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the Great Being thought: &ldquo;I suppose he does not understand what he has done. I will let him know.&rdquo; And he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;These twelve long years I&rsquo;ve dwelt, O king, within your royal park;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And never once before today this hound was known to bark.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Today he shows his teeth so white, defiant now and proud,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And hearing what you told the queen, to warn me, bays aloud.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.120]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the king acknowledged his wrong, and asking to be forgiven he repeated the fourth verse: <span class="t18">{5.233}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;The wrong was mine: you, venerable sir, my purpose was to slay;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But now I favour you once more, and fain would have you stay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this the Great Being said: &ldquo;Of a truth, sire, wise men do not dwell with one who, without having seen a thing with his own eyes, follows the lead of others,&rdquo; and so saying he exposed his misconduct and spoke thus:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;My food of old was pure and white, next motley &rsquo;twas in hue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now it is brown as brown can be &ndash; &rsquo;tis time that I withdrew.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. First on the dais, then upstairs and last below I dine;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Before I&rsquo;m thrust out on my neck, my place I will resign.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Affect you not a faithless friend: like a dry well is he</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">However deep one digs it out, the stream will muddy be.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. A faithful friend sure cultivate, a faithless one eschew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As one athirst hastes to a pool, a faithful friend pursue.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Cling to the friend that clings to you, his love with love requite;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">One who forsakes a faithful friend is deemed a sorry wight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Who cleaves not to a steadfast friend, nor love requites with love,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vilest of men is he, nor ranks the monkey tribe above.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. To meet too often is as bad as not to meet at all;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To ask a boon a whit too soon &ndash; this too makes love to pall.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. Visit a friend but not too oft, nor yet prolong your stay;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At the right moment favours beg: so love will ne&rsquo;er decay.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. Who stay too long find oftentimes that friend is changed to foe;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So ere I lose your friendship I will take my leave and go.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.234}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;Though I with folded hands beseech, you will not lend an ear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You have no word for us to whom your service would be dear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I crave one favour: come again and pay a visit here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;If nothing comes to snap our life, O king, if you and I</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Still live, O fosterer of your realm, perhaps I&rsquo;ll hither fly,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And we may see each other yet, as days and nights go by.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.235}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus spoke the Great Being and preached the Dhamma to the king, saying: &ldquo;Be vigilant, O sire.&rdquo; And leaving the park, after going a round for alms in a district of his own, he departed from Benares and by degrees reached a place in the Himālayas, and after dwelling some time there he descended from the hills and settled in a forest near a frontier village. As soon as he was gone, those councillors once more sat in judgment, robbing the people, and they thought: &ldquo;Should Great Bodhi, the mendicant, return, we shall lose our livelihood. What are we to do to prevent his coming back?&rdquo; Then this occurred to them, &ldquo;Such people as these cannot leave any object to which they are attached. What can be the object here to which he is attached?&rdquo; Then feeling sure it must be the king&rsquo;s <span class="t18">[5.121] </span><a id="a12337"></a>chief consort, they thought: &ldquo;This is the reason why he would return here. We will act in timely manner<a id="a12338"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16765"><span class="t9">{1210}</span></a> and put her to death.&rdquo; And they repeated this to the king, saying: &ldquo;Sire, today a certain report is current in the city.&rdquo; &ldquo;What report?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Great Bodhi the mendicant and the queen send messages to and fro, one to the other.&rdquo; &ldquo;With what objects?&rdquo; &ldquo;His message to the queen, they say, is this, &lsquo;Will you be able by your own power to put the king to death and to grant me the white umbrella?&rsquo; Her message to him is, &lsquo;The king&rsquo;s death, verily, is my charge: you are to come quickly.&rsquo; They constantly repeated this till the king believed it and asked, &ldquo;What then is to be done?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;We must put the queen to death.&rdquo; And without investigating the truth of the matter he said: &ldquo;Well then put her to death: and cutting up her body piecemeal throw it on the dunghill.&rdquo; They did so, and the news of her death was noised abroad throughout the city. Then her four sons said: &ldquo;Our mother though innocent has been put to death by this man,&rdquo; and they became the king&rsquo;s enemies. And the king was greatly terrified.</p>
<p class="p7">The Great Being in due course heard what had happened and thought: &ldquo;Excepting myself there is no one that can pacify these princes and induce them to forgive their father; I will save the king&rsquo;s life and deliver these princes from their evil purpose.&rdquo; So next day he entered a frontier village and after eating the flesh of a monkey given to him by the inhabitants <span class="t18">{5.236}</span> he begged for its skin which he had dried in his ascetic&rsquo;s hut till it had lost all smell and then made it into an inner and outer robe which he laid upon his shoulder. Why did he do so? That he might say, &ldquo;It is very helpful to me.&rdquo; Taking the skin with him he gradually made his way to Benares and drawing nigh to the young princes he said to them, &ldquo;To murder one&rsquo;s own father is a terrible thing: you must not do this. No mortal is exempt from decay and death. I have come here to reconcile you; when I send a message, you are to come to me.&rdquo; After having thus exhorted the youths, he entered the park within the city and seated himself upon a stone slab, spreading the monkey-skin over it.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12339"></a>When the keeper of the park saw this, he went in haste to tell the king. The king on hearing it was filled with joy, and taking those councillors with him went and saluted the Great Being, and sitting down began to converse pleasantly with him. The Great Being without any exchange of friendly greeting went on stroking his monkey-skin. The king said: &ldquo;Sir, without doing anything<a id="a12340"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16767"><span class="t9">{1211}</span></a> for me you continue to rub your monkey-skin. Is this more helpful to you than I am?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sire, this monkey is of the greatest service to me. I travelled about sitting on its back. It carried my waterpot for me. It swept out my dwelling-place.<span class="t18"> [5.122] </span>It performed various duties of a minor kind for me. Through its simplicity I ate its flesh and having had its skin dried I spread it out and sit and lie on it: so it is very useful to me.&rdquo; Thus did he, in order to refute these heretics, attribute the acts of a monkey to the monkey-skin, and with this object he spoke as he did. From his having formerly dressed in its skin he said: &ldquo;I travelled about sitting on its back.&rdquo; From placing it on his shoulder and from having thus carried his drinking vessel he said: &ldquo;It carried my drinking vessel.&rdquo; From the fact of having swept the ground with the skin he said: &ldquo;It sweeps out my dwelling place.&rdquo; When he lies down, because his back is touched by this skin, and when he steps upon it, because it touches his feet, he says, &ldquo;It performed such and such various duties for me,&rdquo; when he was hungry, because he took and ate its flesh, he says, <span class="t18">{5.237}</span> &ldquo;Being such a simple creature, I ate its flesh.&rdquo; On hearing this those councillors thought: &ldquo;This man is guilty of murder. Consider, pray, the act of this ascetic: he says he killed a monkey, ate its flesh and goes about with its skin,&rdquo; and clapping their hands they ridiculed him.</p>
<p class="p7">The Great Being, on seeing them do this, said: &ldquo;These fellows do not know that I am come with this skin to refute their heresies: I will not tell them.&rdquo; And addressing the one that denied causation, he asked, saying: &ldquo;Why, sir, do you blame me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because you have been guilty of an act of treachery to a friend and of murder.&rdquo; Then the Great Being said: &ldquo;If one should believe in you and in your Dhamma and act accordingly, what evil has been done?&rdquo; And refuting his heresy he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;If this your creed, &lsquo;All acts of men, or good or base,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From natural causes spring,&rsquo; I hold, in every case,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where in involuntary acts can wrong find place?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. If such the creed you hold and this be Dhamma true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then was my action right when I that monkey slew.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. Could you but only see how sinful is your creed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You would no longer then with reason blame my deed.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.238}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12341"></a>Thus did the Great Being rebuke him and reduce him to silence. The king, feeling annoyed at the rebuke before the assembly, collapsed<a id="a12342"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16769"><span class="t9">{1212}</span></a> and sat down. And the Great Being, after refuting his heresy, addressed the one who believed that everything is brought about by a Supreme Being said: &ldquo;Why, sir, do you blame me, if you really fall back upon the Dhamma that everything is the creation of a Supreme Being?&rdquo; And he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. &ldquo;If there exists some Lord all powerful to fulfil</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In every creature bliss or woe, and action good or ill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That Lord is stained with wrong. Man does but work his will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. If such the creed you hold and this be Dhamma true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then was my action right when I that monkey slew.</span><span class="t18"> [5.123]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. Could you but only see how sinful is your creed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You would no longer then with reason blame my deed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12343"></a>Thus did he, like one knocking down a mango with a club taken from the mango tree, refute the man who believed in the action of some Supreme Being by his very own Dhamma, and then he thus addressed the believer in former actions, saying: &ldquo;Why, sir, do you blame me if you believe in the truth of the Dhamma that everything happens according to former actions?&rdquo; And he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;From former action still both bliss and woe begin;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This monkey pays his debt, to wit, his former wrong:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Each act&rsquo;s a debt discharged. Where then does guilt come in? </span><span class="t18">{5.239}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. If such the creed you hold and this be Dhamma true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then was my action right when I that monkey slew.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. Could you but only see how sinful is your creed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You would no longer then with reason blame my deed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12344"></a>Having thus refuted the heresy of this man too, he turned to the believer in annihilation<a id="a12345"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16771"><span class="t9">{1213}</span></a> and said: &ldquo;You, sir, maintain that there is no reward and the like, believing that all mortals suffer annihilation here, and that no one goes to a future world. Why then do you blame me?&rdquo; And rebuking him he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. &ldquo;Each living creature&rsquo;s form four elements compose;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To these component parts dissolved each body goes.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. The dead exist no more, the living still live on;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should this world be destroyed, both wise and fools are gone:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Amidst a ruined world guilt-stain defileth none.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. If such the creed you hold and this be Dhamma true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then was my action right when I that monkey slew.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">28. Could you but only see how sinful is your creed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You would no longer then with reason blame my deed.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.240}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did he refute the heresy of this one too and then addressing him who held the Khattiya Dhamma, he said: &ldquo;You, sir, maintain that a man must serve his own interests, even should he have to kill his own father and mother. Why, if you go about professing this belief, do you blame me?&rdquo; And he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">29. &ldquo;The Khattiyas say, poor simple fools that think themselves so wise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A man may kill his parents, if occasion justifies,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or elder brother, children, wife, should need of it arise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did he withstand the views of this man too, and to reveal his own view he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">30. &ldquo;From off a tree beneath whose shade a man would sit and rest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twere treachery to lop a branch. False friends we both detest. </span><span class="t18">[5.124]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">31. But if occasion should arise, then extirpate that tree.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That monkey then, to serve my needs, was rightly slain by me.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">32. If such the creed you hold and this be Dhamma true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then was my action right when I that monkey slew.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">33. Could you but only see how sinful is your creed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You would no longer then with reason blame my deed.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.241}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12346"></a>Thus did he refute the Dhamma of this man too, and now that all these five heretics were dumbfounded and bewildered,<a id="a12347"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16773"><span class="t9">{1214}</span></a> addressing the king he said: &ldquo;Sire, these fellows with whom you go about are big thieves who plunder your realm. Oh! Fool that you are, a man by consorting with fellows such as these both in this present world and that which is to come would meet with great sorrow,&rdquo; and so saying he taught the king the Dhamma and said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">34. &ldquo;This man avers, &lsquo;There is no cause&rsquo;. Another, &lsquo;One is Lord of all&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Some hold, &lsquo;Each deed was done of old&rsquo;. Others, &lsquo;All worlds to ruin fall&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">35. These and the Khattiya heretics are fools who think that they are wise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bad men are they who do wrong themselves and others wickedly advise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Evil communications aye result in pains and penalties.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now by way of illustration, enlarging on the text of his sermon, he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. &ldquo;A wolf disguised as ram of old</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Drew unsuspected nigh the fold.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12348"></a><span class="t12">The panic-stricken</span><a id="a12349"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16775"><span class="t19">{1215}</span></a><span class="t12"> flock it slew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then scampered off to pastures new.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. Thus monks and brahmins often use</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A cloak, the credulous to abuse.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Some on bare ground all dirty lie,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Some fast, some squat in agony.</span><span class="t18"> {5.242}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Some may not drink, some eat by rule,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As saint each poses, wicked fool.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. An evil race of men are they, and fools who think that they are wise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All such not only wrong themselves, but others wickedly advise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Evil communications aye result in pains and penalties.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">39. Who say, &lsquo;No force exists in anything,&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Deny the cause of all, disparaging</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their own and others&rsquo; acts as vanity, O king,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">40. An evil race of men are they, and fools who think that they are wise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All such not only wrong themselves, but others wickedly advise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Evil communications aye result in pains and penalties.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">41. If force exists not anywhere nor acts be good or ill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why should a king keep artisans, to profit by their skill?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">42. It is because force does exist and actions good or ill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That kings keep ever artisans and profit by their skill.</span><span class="t18"> [5.125]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">43. If for a hundred years or more no rain or snow should fall,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Our race, amidst a ruined world, would perish one and all.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">44. But as rains fall and snow withal, the changing year ensures,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That harvest ripens and our land for ages long endures.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12350"></a><span class="t12">45. The bull</span><a id="a12351"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16777"><span class="t19">{1216}</span></a><a id="a12352"></a><span class="t12"> through floods a devious course will take,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">46. So if a leader tortuous paths pursue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To base ends will he guide the vulgar crew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And the whole realm an age of license rue.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">47. But if the bull a course direct should steer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The herd of cows straight follow in his rear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">48. So should their chief to righteous ways be true,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">50. So he that by unrighteous rule his country has destroyed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The sweets that spring from righteousness has never once enjoyed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">51. But he that lets the fruit he plucks first ripen on the tree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Preserves its seed and knows full well how sweet the fruit may be.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">52. So he too by his righteous rule that has preserved the land,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">55. And should he vex his soldiers bold, so skilled to rule the fight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His army will fall off from him and shear him of his might.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">56. So should he wrong or sage or saint, he meets his due reward,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And through his wrong, howe&rsquo;er high born, from heaven will be debarred.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">57. And should a wife by wicked king, though innocent, be slain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He suffers in his children and in hell is racked with pain.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">58. Be just to town and country folk and treat your soldiers well,</span></p>

<p class="p6">The Great Being having thus taught the Dhamma to the king summoned the four young princes and admonished them, explaining to them the king&rsquo;s action, and he said: &ldquo;Ask the king&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; and having persuaded the king to forgive them, he said: &ldquo;Sire, henceforth do not accept the statement of slanderers without weighing their words, and be not guilty of any similar deed of violence, and as for you young princes, act not treacherously towards the king,&rdquo; and he thus admonished them all. Then the king said to him, &ldquo;Venerable sir, it was owing to these men that I done wrong against you and the queen, and through accepting their statement I wrought this evil deed. <span class="t18">{5.246}</span><a id="a12354"></a> I will put all five of them to death.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, you must not do this.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I will order their feet and hands to be cut off.&rdquo; &ldquo;This too you must not do.&rdquo; The king assented, saying: &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; and he stripped them of all their property and disgracing them in various ways, by fastening their hair into five locks,<a id="a12355"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16779"><span class="t9">{1217}</span></a> by putting them into <span class="t18">[5.126] </span>fetters and chains and by sprinkling cow-dung over them, he drove them out of his kingdom. And the Bodhisatta after staying there a few days and admonishing the king, bidding him be vigilant, set off for the Himālayas and developed the Absorptions and Super Knowledges, and so long as he lived, cultivating the Divine Abidings, he became a denizen of the Brahmā Realm.</p>
