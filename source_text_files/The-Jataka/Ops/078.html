<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the Buddha teaches about the quickness of the decay of life&rsquo;s elements. Then he tells a story of a goose who was swifter than the sun, and when asked if anything was swifter than he, taught Dhamma to the king, thereby converting him.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a10925"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the quick goose (javanahaṁsa),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Ānanda = the king (of Benares) (rājā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Sāriputta = the middle (goose) (majjhima),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Moggallāna = the youngest (goose) (kaniṭṭha),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the Buddha&rsquo;s disciples = the other geese (sesahaṁsagaṇā).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a10926"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Impermanence, Animals, Birds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Come, goose.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10927"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana about the Daḷhadhammasuttanta or the Parable of the Strong Men.</span><a id="a10928"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16084"><span class="t9">{880}</span></a><span class="t30"> The Fortunate One said: &ldquo;Suppose, monks, four archers to stand at the four points of the compass, strong men, well trained and of great skill, perfect in archery and then let a man come and say, &ldquo;If these four archers, strong, well trained, and of great skill, perfect in archery </span><span class="t18">{4.212}</span><span class="t30"> shoot forth arrows from four points, I will catch those arrows as they are shot, and before they touch the ground,&rdquo; would you not agree, sure enough, that he must be a very swift man and the perfection of swiftness? Well, monks, great as the swiftness of such a man might be, great as the swiftness of sun and moon, there is something swifter: great, I say, monks, as the swiftness of such a man might be, great as the swiftness of the sun and moon, and though the gods outfly sun or moon in swiftness, there is something swifter than the gods: great, monks, as the swiftness of that man (and so forth), yet more swiftly than the gods can go, the elements which make up life do decay. Therefore, monks, this you must learn, to be careful; verily I say unto you, this you must learn.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10929"></a><span class="t30">Two days after this teaching, they were talking about it in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Monks, the Teacher in his own peculiar province as Buddha, illustrating the nature of what makes up life, showed it to be transient and weak, and smote with extreme terror monks and unconverted alike. Oh, the might of a Buddha!&rdquo; The Teacher entered and asked what they talked of. They told him; and he said: &ldquo;It is no marvel, monks, if I in my omniscience alarm the monks by my teaching, and show how transient are life&rsquo;s elements. Even I, when without natural cause</span><a id="a10930"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16087"><span class="t9">{881}</span></a><span class="t30"> I was conceived by a goose, showed forth the transient nature of the elements of life, and by my teaching alarmed the whole court of a king, together with the king of Benares himself.&rdquo; So saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Great Being was born as a swift goose, which lived in Mount Cittakūṭa in a <span class="t18">[4.133] </span>flock of ninety thousand other such geese. One day, having along with his flock eaten the wild rice that grew in a certain pool in the plains of Jambudīpa, he flew through the air (and it was as though a golden mat were spread from end to end of the city of Benares), and he flew slowly as in sport to Cittakūṭa. Now the king of Benares saw him; and said to his courtiers, &ldquo;That bird must be a king, as I am.&rdquo; He took a fancy to the bird, and taking with him garlands, perfumes and unguents, went looking for the Great Being; and with him he caused to go all manner of music. When the Great Being saw him doing honour in this way, he asked the other geese, <span class="t18">{4.213}</span> &ldquo;When a king would do such honour to me, what does he want?&rdquo; &ldquo;He wants to make friends with you, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, let me be friends with the king,&rdquo; said he; and he made friends with the king, and then returned.</p>
<p class="p7">One day after this, when the king was in his park, and went to Lake Anotatta, the bird flew to the king, having water on one wing and powder of sandalwood on the other; with the water he sprinkled the king, and cast the powder upon him, then while the company looked on, away he flew with his flock to Cittakūṭa. From that time the king used to long for the Great Being; he would linger, watching the way by which he came, and thinking: &ldquo;Today my comrade will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10931"></a>Now the two youngest geese belonging to the flock of the Great Being, made up their minds to fly a race with the sun; so they asked leave of the Great Being, to try a race with the sun. &ldquo;My lads,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the sun&rsquo;s speed is swift, and you will never be able to race with him. You will perish in the course, so do not go.&rdquo; A second time they asked, and a third time; but the Bodhisatta withstood them up to the third time of asking. But they stood to it, not knowing their own strength, and were resolved without telling the king to fly with the sun. So before sunrise they had taken their places on the peak of the Mount Yugandhara.<a id="a10932"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16089"><span class="t9">{882}</span></a> The Great Being missed them, and asked whither they had gone. When he heard what had happened, he thought: &ldquo;They will never be able to fly with the sun, but will perish in the course. I will save their lives.&rdquo; So he too went to the peak of Yugandhara, and sat beside them.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10933"></a>When the sun&rsquo;s round showed over the horizon, the young geese rose, and darted forward along with the sun; the Great Being flew forward with them. The youngest flew on into the forenoon, then grew faint; in the joints of his wings he felt as if a fire had been kindled. Then he made a signal to the Great Being, &ldquo;Brother, I can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; &ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; said the Great Being, &ldquo;I will save you,&rdquo; and taking him on his outspread wings, he soothed him, and conveyed him to Mount Cittakūṭa, and placed him in the midst of the geese. Then he flew off, and catching up the sun, went <span class="t18">[4.134] </span>on side by side with the other. Until near midday <span class="t18">{4.214}</span> the other flew with the sun, and then he grew faint and felt as though a fire had been kindled in the joints of his wings. Making a sign to the Great Being, he cried, &ldquo;Brother, I cannot do it!&rdquo; Him too the Great Being comforted in the same way, and taking him on his outspread wings, bore him to Cittakūṭa.</p>
<p class="p7">At that moment the sun was plumb overhead. The Great Being thought: &ldquo;Today I will test the sun&rsquo;s strength,&rdquo; and darting back with one swoop, he perched on Yugandhara. Then rising with one swoop he overtook the sun, and flying now in front, now behind, thought to himself, &ldquo;For me to fly with the sun is profitless, born of mere folly: what is he to me? Away I will go to Benares, and there tell my comrade the king a message of righteousness and truth.&rdquo; Then turning, before yet the sun had moved from the middle of the sky, he traversed the whole world from end to end; then slackening speed, traversed from end to end the whole of Jambudīpa, and came at last to Benares.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10934"></a>The whole city, twelve leagues in compass, was as it were under the bird&rsquo;s shadow,<a id="a10935"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16091"><span class="t9">{883}</span></a> there was not a crack or crevice; then as by degrees the speed slackened, holes and crevices appeared in the sky. The Great Being went slower, and came down from the air, and alighted in front of a window. &ldquo;My comrade is come!&rdquo; cried the king in great joy; and getting a golden seat for the bird to perch on, said: &ldquo;Come in, friend, and sit here,&rdquo; and recited the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Come, noble goose, come sit you here; dear is your sight to me;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now you are master of the place; choose anything you see.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being perched on the golden seat. The king anointed him under the wings with unguents a hundred times refined, nay, a thousand times, gave him sweet rice and sugared water in a golden dish, and talked with him in a voice of honey: <span class="t18">{4.215}</span> &ldquo;Good friend, you have come alone; whence come you now?&rdquo; The bird told him the whole matter at large. Then the king said to him, &ldquo;Friend, show me too your swiftness against the sun.&rdquo; &ldquo;O mighty king, that swiftness cannot be shown.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then show me something like it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good, O king, I will show you something like it. Summon your archers who can shoot swift as lightning.&rdquo; The king sent for them. The Great Being chose four of these, and with them went down from the palace into the courtyard. There he caused to be set up in the ground a stone column, and about his own neck a bell to be bound.</p>
<p class="p7">He then perched on the top of the stone pillar, and placing the four archers looking away from the pillar towards the four points, said: &ldquo;O king, let these four men shoot four arrows at the same moment in four <span class="t18">[4.135] </span>different directions, and I will catch these arrows before they touch the ground, and lay them at the men&rsquo;s feet. You will know when I am gone for the arrows by the tinkling of this bell, but I shall not be seen.&rdquo; Then all at one moment the men shot the four arrows; he caught them and laid them at the men&rsquo;s feet, and was seen to be sitting upon the pillar. &ldquo;Did you see my speed, O king?&rdquo; he asked; then went on, &ldquo;that speed, O great king, is not my swiftest nor my middle speed, &rsquo;tis my slowest of the slow: and this will show you how swift I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king asked him, &ldquo;Well, friend, is there any speed swifter than yours?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is, my friend. Swifter than my swiftest a hundredfold, a thousandfold, nay a hundred thousandfold, is the decay of the elements of life in living beings: so they crumble away, so are they destroyed.&rdquo; Thus he made clear, how the world of form crumbles away, being destroyed moment by moment. The king hearing this was in fear of death, could not keep his senses, but fell in a faint. The multitude were in despair, they sprinkled the king&rsquo;s face with water, and brought him round. Then the Great Being said to him, &ldquo;O great king, fear not; <span class="t18">{4.216}</span><a id="a10936"></a> but remember death. Walk in righteousness, give alms and do good, be careful.&rdquo; Then the king answered and said: &ldquo;My lord, without a wise teacher like you I cannot live, do not return<a id="a10937"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16093"><span class="t9">{884}</span></a> to mount Cittakūṭa, but stay here, instruct me, be my teacher to teach me!&rdquo; and he put this request in two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;By hearing of the loved one love is fed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By sight the craving for the lost falls dead:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Since sight and hearing makes men lief and dear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With sight of you let me be favouréd.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Dear is your voice, and dearer far your presence when I see:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then since I love the sight of you, O Goose, come dwell with me!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Ever would I dwell with you, in the honour thus conferred;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But you might say in wine one day: &lsquo;Broil me that royal bird!&rsquo; &rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.217}</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;then I will never touch wine or strong drink,&rdquo; and he made this promise in the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Accursed be both food and drink I should love more than you;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And I will taste no drop nor sup while you shall stay with me!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After this the Bodhisatta recited six verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;The cry of jackals or of birds is understood with ease;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea, but the word of men, O king, is darker far than these!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. A man may think, this is my friend, my comrade, of my kin,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10938"></a><span class="t12">But friendship goes, and often hate and enmity begin.</span><a id="a10939"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16095"><span class="t19">{885}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">[4.136]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. Who has your heart, is near to you, with you, where&rsquo;er he be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But who dwells with you, and your heart estranged, afar is he.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Who in your house of kindly heart shall be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is kindly still though far across the sea:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who in your house shall hostile be of heart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hostile he is though ocean-wide apart.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Your foes, O lord of chariots! Though near you, are afar:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But, fosterer of your realm! The good in heart closely linked are.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. Who stay too long, find oftentimes that friend is changed to foe;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then ere I lose your friendship, I will take my leave, and go.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.218}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the king said to him:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;Though I with folded hands beseech, you will not give me ear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You spare no word for us, to whom your service would be dear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I crave one favour: come again and pay a visit here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;If nothing comes to snap our life, O king! If you and I</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Still live, O fosterer of your folk! Perhaps I&rsquo;ll hither fly,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And we may see each other yet, as days and nights go by.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">With this address to the king, the Great Being departed to Cittakūṭa.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: &ldquo;Thus, monks, long ago, even when I was born as one of the animals, I showed the frailty of all life&rsquo;s elements, and declared the Dhamma.&rdquo; So saying, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the king, Moggallāna was the youngest bird, Sāriputta was the second, the Buddha&rsquo;s followers were all geese of the flock, and I myself was the swift goose.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is in danger of falling away from the monastic life through the temptations of a young woman. The Buddha tells a story of a father who took his son and went to the Himālayas to become ascetics. There a woman seduced the son, but after listening to his father&rsquo;s advice on the troubles of the lay life, he gave up the idea of going to the city with her.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;No wood is chopped.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10950"></a><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{4.219}</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about the allurements of a sensual girl.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10951"></a><a id="a10952"></a><span class="t30">There was then, we learn, a girl of about sixteen, daughter of a citizen of Sāvatthi, such as might bring good luck to a man, yet no man chose her. So her mother thought to herself, &ldquo;This my daughter is of full age, yet no one chooses her. I will use her as bait for a fish, and make one of those Sākiyan ascetics come back to the world, and live upon him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At the time there was a young man of good birth living in Sāvatthi, who had given his heart to the dispensation and went forth. But from the time when he had received full ordination he had lost all desire for learning, and lived devoted to the adornment of his </span><span class="t18">[4.137] </span><span class="t30">person.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The lay sister used to prepare in her house rice gruel, and other food hard or soft, and standing at the door, as the monks walked along the streets, looked out for someone who could be tempted by the craving for delicacies. Streaming by went a crowd of monks who upheld the Three Baskets, including the Abhidhamma and the Vinaya; but among them she saw none ready to rise to her bait. Among the figures with bowl and robe, preachers of the Dhamma with honey-sweet voice, moving like fleecy scud before the wind, she saw not one.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">But at last she perceived a man approaching, the outer corners of his eyes anointed, hair hanging down, wearing an under-robe of fine cloth, and an outer robe shaken and cleansed, bearing a bowl coloured like some precious gem, and a sunshade after his own heart, a man who let his senses have their own way, his body much bronzed. &ldquo;Here is a man I can catch!&rdquo; thought she; and greeting him, she took his bowl, and invited him into the house. She found him a seat, and provided rice gruel and all the rest; then after the meal, begged him to make that house his resort in future. So he used to visit the house after that, and in course of time became intimate.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day, the lay sister said in his hearing, &ldquo;In this household we are happy enough, only I have no son or son-in-law capable of keeping it up.&rdquo; The man heard it, and wondering what reason she could have for so saying, in a little while he was as it were pierced to the heart. She said to her daughter, &ldquo;Tempt this man, and get him into your power.&rdquo; So the girl after that time decked herself and adorned herself, and tempted him with all women&rsquo;s tricks and wiles. </span><span class="t18">{4.220}</span><span class="t30"> (You must understand that a &ldquo;fat&rdquo; girl does not mean one whose body is fat,</span><a id="a10953"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16097"><span class="t9">{886}</span></a><span class="t30"> but be she fat or be she thin, by power of the five sensual passions she is called &ldquo;fat&rdquo;.) Then the man, being young and under the power of passion, thought in his heart, &ldquo;I cannot now hold on to the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation,&rdquo; and he went to the monastery, and laying down bowl and robe, said to his spiritual teachers, &ldquo;I am discontented.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then they conducted him to the Teacher, and said: &ldquo;Sir, this monk is discontented.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is this true which they say,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;that you are discontented, monk?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir, true it is.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then what made you so?&rdquo; &ldquo;A sensual girl, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monk,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;long, long ago, when you were living in the forest, this same girl was a hindrance to your holiness, and did you great harm; then why are you again discontented on her account?&rdquo; Then at the request of the monks he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10954"></a><a id="a10955"></a><a id="a10956"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a brahmin family of great wealth, and after his education was finished managed the estate. Then his wife brought forth a son, and died. He thought: &ldquo;As with my beloved wife, so with me death shall not be ashamed;<a id="a10957"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16099"><span class="t9">{887}</span></a><a id="a10958"></a> what is a home to me? I will become an ascetic.&rdquo; So forsaking his sensual desires, he went with his son to the Himālayas; and there with him entered upon the ascetic life, developed the Absorptions and Super Knowledges, and dwelt in the woods, supporting life on fruits and roots.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time the borderers raided the countryside; and having assailed a town, and taken prisoners, laden with spoil they returned to the border. Amongst them was a maiden, beautiful, but endowed with all a deceitful person&rsquo;s cunning. This girl thought to herself, &ldquo;These men, when they have carried us off home, will use us as slaves; I must find some <span class="t18">[4.138] </span>way to escape.&rdquo; So she said: &ldquo;My lord, I wish to retire; let me go and stay away for a moment.&rdquo; Thus she deceived the robbers, and fled.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10959"></a>Now the Bodhisatta had gone out to fetch fruits and the like, leaving his son in the hut. While he was away, this girl, as she wandered about in the forest, came to the hut, in the morning; <span class="t18">{4.221}</span> and tempting the son of the ascetic with desire of love, destroyed his virtue, and got him under her power. She said to him, &ldquo;Why dwell here in the forest? Come, let us go to a village and make a home for ourselves. There it is easy to enjoy all the pleasures and passions of sense.&rdquo; He consented, and said: &ldquo;My father is now out in the woods looking for wild fruits. When we have seen him, we will both go away together.&rdquo; Then the girl thought: &ldquo;This young innocent knows nothing; but his father must have become an ascetic in his old age. When he comes in, he will want to know what I do here, and beat me, and drag me out by the feet, and throw me into the forest. I will get clear away before he comes.&rdquo; So she said to the lad, &ldquo;I will go first, and you may follow,&rdquo; then pointing out the landmarks, she departed. After she had gone, the lad became sorrowful, and did none of his duties as he was used; but wrapped himself up head and all, and lay down within the hut, fretting.</p>
<p class="p7">When the Great Being came in with his wild fruits, he observed the girl&rsquo;s footmark. &ldquo;That is a woman&rsquo;s footprint,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;my son&rsquo;s virtue must have been lost.&rdquo; Then he entered the hut, and laid down the wild fruit, and put the question to his son by repeating the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;No wood is chopped, and you have brought no water from the pool,</span></p>

<p class="p6">Hearing his father&rsquo;s voice, the lad rose, and greeted him; and with all respect made known that he could not endure a forest life, repeating a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;I cannot live in forests: this, O Kassapa, I swear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10960"></a><span class="t12">Hard is the woodland life, and back to men</span><a id="a10961"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16101"><span class="t19">{888}</span></a><span class="t12"> I would repair.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Teach me, O brahmin, when I leave, that wheresoe&rsquo;er I go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The customs of the countryside I may most fully know.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.222}</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;Very good, my son,&rdquo; said the Great Being, &ldquo;I will tell you the customs of the country.&rdquo; And he repeated this couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;If &rsquo;tis your mind to leave behind the woodland fruits and roots</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And dwell in cities, hear me teach the way which that life suits:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. Keep clear of every precipice, from poison keep afar,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sit never in the mud, and walk with care where serpents are.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [4.139]</span></p>
<p class="p6">The ascetic&rsquo;s son, not understanding this pithy counsel, asked:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;What has your precipice to do with the ascetic way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your mud, your poison, and your snake? Come tell me this, I pray.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The other explained &ndash;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;There is a liquor in the world, my son, that men call wine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fragrant, delicious, honey-sweet, and cheap, of flavour fine:</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. High honours shown by other men, respect and fame and gain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This is the mud, O Nārada, which holy men may stain.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. The house you come to for your food, when men sit down to meat,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. When by another entertained with food or drink, this do:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eat not too much, nor drink too much, and fleshly sensual desires eschew.</span></p>

<p class="p6">As his father went on talking and talking, the lad came to his senses, and said: &ldquo;Enough of the world for me, dear father!&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.224}</span> Then his father instructed him how to develop kindliness and other good feelings. The son followed his father&rsquo;s instruction, and before long caused Absorption to spring up within him. And both of them, father and son, without a break in the trance, were born again in the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time this sensual girl was the young woman, the discontented monk was the ascetic&rsquo;s son, and I was the father.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks are discussing the Buddha&rsquo;s resourcefulness in teaching. The Buddha tells a story of a young brahmin who, having finished his studies, lost his teacher&rsquo;s fee, and sat on the bank of the Ganges till the king came, as only the latter could repair the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the young brahmin (brāhmaṇamāṇava),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Sāriputta = the teacher (ācariya),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;O plunged in thought.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about praise of his own wisdom. In the Dhamma Hall they were talking, &ldquo;See, monks, the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; skill in resource! He showed that young </span><span class="t18">[4.140] </span><a id="a10969"></a><span class="t30">gentleman Nanda</span><a id="a10970"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16103"><span class="t9">{889}</span></a><span class="t30"> the host of </span><span class="t30">Accharā</span><a id="a10971"></a><a id="a10972"></a><span class="t30">, and made him an Arahat; he gave a cloth to his little foot-page,</span><a id="a10973"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16105"><span class="t9">{890}</span></a><a id="a10974"></a><span class="t30"> and made him an Arahat along with the four branches of analytic knowledges;</span><a id="a10975"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16107"><span class="t9">{891}</span></a><a id="a10976"></a><a id="a10977"></a><a id="a10978"></a><a id="a10979"></a><span class="t30"> to the blacksmith he showed a lotus, and made him an Arahat; with what diverse expedients he instructs living beings!&rdquo; The Teacher entered and asked what they sat talking of; they told him. Said he, &ldquo;It is not the first time that the Tathāgata has had skill in means, and knew what will have the desired effect; he had skill in means before.&rdquo; So saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the country was without gold; for the king oppressed the country and so got treasure. At that time the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family of a certain village in Kāsi. When he came of age, he went to Taxila, saying: &ldquo;I will get money to pay my teacher afterwards, by soliciting alms honourably.&rdquo; He acquired learning, and when his education was done, he said: &ldquo;I will use all diligence, my teacher, to bring you the money due for your teaching.&rdquo; Then taking leave of him, he departed, and traversing the land sought alms.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10980"></a>When he had honourably and fairly got a few ounces<a id="a10981"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16109"><span class="t9">{892}</span></a> of gold, he set out to hand them over to his teacher; and on the way went aboard a boat in order to cross the Ganges. As the boat swayed to and fro on the water, the gold fell in. Then he thought: &ldquo;This is a country hard to get gold in; <span class="t18">{4.225}</span> if I go seeking again for money to pay my teacher withal, there will be long delay. What if I sit fasting on the bank of the Ganges? The king will by and by come to learn of my sitting here, and he will send some of his courtiers, but I will have nothing to say to them. Then the king himself will come, and by that means I shall get my teacher&rsquo;s fee from him.&rdquo; So he wrapped about him his upper robe, and putting outside the sacrificial thread, sat on the bank of the Ganges, like a statue of gold upon the silver sand.</p>
<p class="p7">The passing crowds, seeing him sit there and take no food, asked him why he sat. But he had never a word for one of them. Next day the villagers of the suburb got wind of his sitting there, and they too came and asked, but he told them no more; the villagers seeing his exhausted condition went away lamenting. On the third day came people from the city, on the fourth came the city grandees, on the fifth those about the king, on the sixth day the king sent his ministers; but to none of them would the man speak.<span class="t18"> [4.141]</span></p>
<p class="p7">On the seventh day the king in alarm came to the man, and asked an explanation, reciting the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;O plunged in thought on Ganges&rsquo; bank, why spoke you not again</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In answer to my messages? Will you conceal your pain?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When this he heard, the Great Being replied, &ldquo;O great king! The sorrow must be told to him that is able to take it away, and to no other,&rdquo; and he repeated seven verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;O fostering lord of Kāsi land! If sorrow be your lot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell not that sorrow to a soul if he can help it not.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. But whosoever can relieve one part of it by right,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To him let all his wish declare each sorrow-stricken wight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. The cry of jackals or of birds is understood with ease;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10982"></a><span class="t12">Yea, but the word of men, O king, is darker far than these.</span><span class="t18"> {4.226}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. A man may think, &lsquo;This is my friend, my comrade, of my kin,&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10983"></a><span class="t12">But friendship goes, and often hate and enmity begin!</span><a id="a10984"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16111"><span class="t19">{893}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. He who not being asked and asked again</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Out of due season will declare his pain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Surely displeases those who are his friends,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10985"></a><span class="t12">And they who wish him well lament amain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Knowing fit time for speaking how to find,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Knowing a wise man of a kindred mind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The wise to such a one his woe declares,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In gentle words with meaning hid behind.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. But should he see that nothing can amend</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His hardships, and that telling them will tend</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To no good issue, let the wise alone</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Endure, reserved and shamefast to the end.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.227}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being discourse in these seven verses to teach the king; and then repeated four others to show his search for money to pay the teacher withal:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;O king! Whole kingdoms I have scoured, the cities of each king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Each town or village, craving alms, my teacher&rsquo;s fee to bring.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Householder, courtier, man of wealth, brahmin &ndash; at every door</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seeking, a little gold I gained, an ounce or two, no more.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now that is lost, O mighty king! And so I grieve full sore.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. No power had your messengers to free me from my pain:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I weighed them well, O mighty king! So I did not explain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. But you have power, O mighty king! To free me from my pain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For I have weighed your merit well; to you I do explain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the king heard his utterance, he replied, &ldquo;Trouble not, brahmin, for I will give you your teacher&rsquo;s fee,&rdquo; and he restored him two-fold. <span class="t18">[4.142]</span></p>
<p class="p7">To make this clear the Teacher repeated the last verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;The fostering lord of Kāsi land did to this man restore</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(In fullest trust) of gold refined twice what he had before.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the Great Being had thus delivered himself, he proceeded to pay his teacher&rsquo;s fee; and the king in like manner followed his advice, giving alms and doing good, and ruled in righteousness. So did they both finally pass away according to their deeds.<span class="t18"> {4.228}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: &ldquo;So, monks, it is not only now, but the Tathāgata had skill in means previously.&rdquo; Then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the king, Sāriputta the teacher, and I was the young man.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the devotees at Sāvatthi want a sign of the Buddha left behind when he goes on teaching tour. Ven. Ānanda gets permission to have a Bodhi tree planted in Jetavana, and for the Buddha to sit under it for one night. The Buddha then tells a story of how, as a Universal Monarch in a previous life, Ānanda had found the area of the Bodhi tree, and worshipped at it.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (the brahmin) Kāliṅgabhāradvāja,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;King Kāliṅga.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10993"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana about worship of the Bodhi tree performed by elder Ānanda.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10994"></a><span class="t30">When the Tathāgata had set forth on pilgrimage, for the purpose of gathering in those who were ripe for conversion, the citizens of Sāvatthi proceeded to Jetavana, their hands full of garlands and fragrant wreaths, and finding no other place to show their reverence, laid them by the gateway of the perfumed chamber and went off. This caused great rejoicings. But Anāthapiṇḍika got to hear of it; and on the return of the Tathāgata visited elder Ānanda and said to him, &ldquo;This monastery, sir, is left unprovided while the Tathāgata goes on pilgrimage, and there is no place for the people to do reverence by offering fragrant wreaths and garlands. Will you be so kind, sir, as to tell the Tathāgata of this matter, and learn from him whether or not it is possible to find a place for this purpose.&rdquo; The other, quite willingly, did so, asking, &ldquo;How many shrines are there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Three, Ānanda.&rdquo; &ldquo;Which are they?&rdquo; &ldquo;Shrines for a relic of the body, a relic of use or wear, a relic of memorial.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10995"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16113"><span class="t9">{894}</span></a><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Can a shrine be made, sir, during your life?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Ānanda, not a body-shrine; that kind is made when a Buddha enters Nibbāna. A shrine of memorial is improper because the connection depends on the imagination only. But the great Bodhi tree used by the Buddhas is fit for a shrine, be they alive or be they dead.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, while you are away on pilgrimage the great monastery of Jetavana </span><span class="t18">[4.143] </span><span class="t30">is unprotected, and the people have no place where they can show their reverence. Shall I plant a seed of the great Bodhi tree before the gateway of Jetavana?&rdquo; &ldquo;By all means so do, Ānanda, and that shall be as it were an abiding place for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The elder told this to Anāthapiṇḍika, and Visākhā, and the king. Then at the gateway of Jetavana he cleared out a pit for the Bodhi tree to stand in, and said to the chief elder, Moggallāna, &ldquo;I want to plant a Bodhi tree in front of Jetavana. Will you get me a fruit of the great Bodhi tree?&rdquo; The elder, willingly, passed through the air to the platform under the Bodhi tree. </span><span class="t18">{4.229}</span><a id="a10996"></a><span class="t30"> He placed in his robe a fruit that was dropping</span><a id="a10997"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16116"><span class="t9">{895}</span></a><a id="a10998"></a><span class="t30"> from its stalk but had not reached the ground, brought it back, and delivered it to Ānanda. The elder informed the king of Kosala that he was to plant the Bodhi tree that day. So in the evening time the king came with a great concourse, bringing all things necessary; then also Anāthapiṇḍika and Visākhā came and a crowd of the faithful besides.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">In the place where the Bodhi tree was to be planted the elder had placed a golden jar, and in the bottom of it was a hole; all was filled with earth moistened with fragrant water. He said: &ldquo;O king, plant this seed of the Bodhi tree,&rdquo; giving it to the king. But the king, thinking that his kingdom was not to be in his hands for ever, and that Anāthapiṇḍika ought to plant it, passed the seed to Anāthapiṇḍika, the great merchant. Then Anāthapiṇḍika stirred up the fragrant soil and dropped it in. The instant it dropped from his hand, before the very eyes of all, it sprang up as broad as a plough-head a Bodhi sapling, fifty cubits tall; on the four sides and upwards shot forth five great branches of fifty cubits in length, like the trunk. So stood the tree, a very lord of the forest already; a mighty miracle! The king poured round the tree jars of gold and of silver, in number eight hundred, filled with scented water, beauteous with a great quantity of blue water-lilies, and caused to be set there a long line of vessels all full, and a seat he had made of the seven precious things, golden dust he had sprinkled about it, a wall was built round the precincts, he erected a gate chamber of the seven precious things. Great was the honour paid to it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The elder, approaching the Tathāgata, said to him, &ldquo;Sir, for the people&rsquo;s good, accomplish under the Bodhi tree which I have planted that height of Attainment to which you attained under the great Bodhi tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is this you say, Ānanda?&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;There is no other place can support me, if I sit there and attain to that which I attained in the enclosure of the great Bodhi tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Ānanda, &ldquo;I pray you for the good of the people, to use this tree for the rapture of Attainment, in so far as this spot of ground can support the weight.&rdquo; The Teacher used it during one night for the rapture of Attainment.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The elder informed the king, and all the rest, and called it by the name of the Bodhi Festival. And this tree, having been planted by Ānanda, was known by the name of Ānanda&rsquo;s Bodhi tree.</span><a id="a10999"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16118"><span class="t9">{896}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11000"></a><span class="t30">At that time they began to talk of it in the Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;Monks, while yet the Tathāgata lived, the venerable Ānanda caused a Bodhi tree to be planted, </span><span class="t18">{4.230}</span><span class="t30"> and great reverence to be paid to it. Oh, how great is the elder&rsquo;s power!&rdquo; The Teacher entered and asked what they were talking of. They told him. He said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that Ānanda led captive mankind in the four great continents, with all the surrounding throngs, and caused a vast quantity of scented wreaths to be brought, and made a Bodhi Festival in the precinct of the great Bodhi tree.&rdquo; So saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, in the kingdom of Kāliṅga, and in the city of Dantapura, reigned a king named Kāliṅga. He had two sons, named <span class="t18">[4.144]</span> Mahākāliṅga and Cullakāliṅga, Kāliṅga the Greater and the Less. Now fortune-tellers had foretold that the eldest son would reign after his father&rsquo;s death; but that the youngest would live as an ascetic, and live by alms, yet his son would be a Universal Monarch.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11001"></a>Time passed by, and on his father&rsquo;s death the eldest son became king, the youngest viceroy. The youngest, ever thinking that a son born of him was to be a Universal Monarch, grew arrogant on that account. This the king could not accept, so he sent a messenger to arrest Cullakāliṅga. The man came and said: &ldquo;Prince, the king wishes to have you arrested, so save your life.&rdquo; The prince showed the courtier charged with this mission his own signet ring, a fine rug, and his sword: these three. Then he said: &ldquo;By these tokens<a id="a11002"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16120"><span class="t9">{897}</span></a> you shall know my son, and make him king.&rdquo; With these words, he sped away into the forest. There he built a hut in a pleasant place, and lived as an ascetic upon the bank of a river.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11003"></a>Now in the kingdom of Madda, and in the city of Sāgala, a daughter was born to the king of Madda. Of the girl, as of the prince, fortune-tellers foretold that she should live as an ascetic, but her son was to be a Universal Monarch. The kings of Jambudīpa, hearing this rumour, came together with one accord, and surrounded the city. The king thought to himself, &ldquo;Now, if I give my daughter to one, all the other kings will be enraged. I will try to save her.&rdquo; So with wife and daughter he fled disguised away into the forest; and after building him a hut some distance up the river, above the hut of prince Kāliṅga, <span class="t18">{4.231}</span> he lived there as an ascetic, eating what he could pick up.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11004"></a>The parents, wishing to save their daughter, left her behind in the hut, and went out to gather wild fruits. While they were gone she gathered flowers of all kinds, and made them into a flower-wreath. Now on the bank of the Ganges there is a mango tree with beautiful flowers, which forms a kind of natural ladder. Upon this she climbed, and while playing managed to drop the wreath of flowers into the water.<a id="a11005"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16122"><span class="t9">{898}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">One day, as prince Kāliṅga was coming out of the river after a bath, this flower-wreath caught in his hair.</p>
<p class="p7">He looked at it, and said: &ldquo;Some woman made this, and no full-grown woman but a tender young girl. I must search for her.&rdquo; So deeply in love he journeyed up the Ganges, until he heard her singing in a sweet voice, as she sat in the mango tree. He approached the foot of the tree, <span class="t18">[4.145] </span><a id="a11006"></a>and seeing her, said: &ldquo;What are you, fair lady?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am human, sir,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Come down, then,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Sir, I cannot; I am of the warrior caste.&rdquo;<a id="a11007"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16124"><span class="t9">{899}</span></a> &ldquo;So am I also, lady: come down!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no, sir, that I cannot do. Saying will not make a warrior; if you are so, tell me the secrets of that mystery.&rdquo; Then they repeated to each other these guild secrets. And the princess came down, and they transgressed with one another.</p>
<p class="p7">When her parents returned she told them about this son of the king of Kālinga, and how he came into the forest, in all detail. They consented to give her to him. While they lived together in happy union, the princess conceived, and after ten months brought forth a son with the signs of good luck and virtue; and they named him Kāliṅga. He grew up, and learned all arts and accomplishments from his father and grandfather.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11008"></a>At length his father knew from the conjunctions of the stars that his brother was dead. So he called his son, and said: &ldquo;My son, you must not spend your life in the forest. Your father&rsquo;s brother, Mahākāliṅga, is dead; you must go to Dantapura, and receive your hereditary kingdom.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.232}</span> Then he gave him the things he had brought away with him, signet, rug, and sword, saying: &ldquo;My son, in the city of Dantapura, in such a street, lives a courtier who is my very good servant. Descend into his house and enter his bedchamber, and show him these three things and tell him you are my son. He will place you upon the throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11009"></a><a id="a11010"></a><a id="a11011"></a>The lad bade farewell to his parents and grandparents; and by power of his own virtue he passed through the air, and descending into the house of that courtier entered his bedchamber. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the other. &ldquo;The son of Cullakāliṅga,&rdquo; said he, disclosing the three tokens. The courtier told it to the palace, and all those of the court decorated the city and spread the umbrella of royalty over his head. Then the family priest, who was named Kāliṅgabhāradvāja, taught him the ten ceremonies which a Universal Monarch has to perform, and he fulfilled those duties. Then on the fifteenth day, the Uposatha, came to him from Cakkadaha the precious Wheel Jewel, from the Uposatha stock the Elephant Jewel, from the royal Valāha breed the Horse Jewel, from Vepulla the precious Jewel; and the Jewels of wife, retinue, and prince made their appearance.<a id="a11012"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16126"><span class="t9">{900}</span></a> Then he achieved sovereignty in the whole terrestrial sphere.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, surrounded by a company which covered six-and-thirty leagues, and mounted upon an elephant all white, tall as a peak of Mount <span class="t18">[4.146]</span><a id="a11013"></a> Kelāsa, in great pomp and splendour he went to visit his parents. But beyond the circuit<a id="a11014"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16128"><span class="t9">{901}</span></a> around the great Bodhi tree, the throne of victory of all the Buddhas, which has become the very navel of the earth, beyond this the elephant was unable to pass: again and again the king urged him on, but pass he could not.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher recited the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;King Kāliṅga, lord supreme,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ruled the earth by law and right,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To the Bodhi tree once he came</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On an elephant of might.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hereupon the king&rsquo;s family priest, who was travelling with the king, thought to himself, &ldquo;In the air is no hindrance; why cannot the king make his elephant go on? <span class="t18">{4.233}</span><a id="a11015"></a> I will go, and see.&rdquo; Then descending from the air, he beheld the throne of victory of all Buddhas, the navel of the earth, that circuit around the great Bodhi tree. At that time, it is said, for the space of a royal acre<a id="a11016"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16130"><span class="t9">{902}</span></a> was never a blade of grass, not so big as a hare&rsquo;s whisker; it seemed as it were a smooth-spread sand bright like a silver plate; but on all sides were grass, creepers, mighty trees like the lords of the forest, as though standing in reverent wise all about with their faces turned towards the throne of the Bodhi tree. When the brahmin beheld this spot of earth, &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;is the place where all the Buddhas have crushed all the desires of the flesh; and beyond this none can pass, no not if he were Sakka himself.&rdquo; Then approaching the king, he told him the quality of the Bodhi tree circuit, and bade him descend.</p>
<p class="p7">By way of explaining this the Teacher recited these verses following:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;This Kāliṅgabhāradvāja told his king, the ascetic&rsquo;s son,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As he rolled the Wheel Jewel, guiding him, obeisance done:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. This the place the poets sing of; here, O mighty king, alight!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here attained to Awakening perfect Buddhas, shining bright.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. In the world, tradition has it, this one spot is hallowed ground,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11017"></a><span class="t12">Where in attitude of reverence herbs and creepers stand around.</span><a id="a11018"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16132"><span class="t19">{903}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. Come, descend and do obeisance; since as far as the ocean bound</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In the fertile earth all-fostering this one spot is hallowed ground. </span><span class="t18">[4.147]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. All the elephants you ownest thoroughbred by dam and sire,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hither drive them, they will surely come thus far, but come no nigher.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. He is thoroughbred you ride on; drive the creature as you will,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He can go not one step further: here the elephant stands still.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. Spake the soothsayer, heard Kāliṅga; then the king to him, said he,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Driving deep the goad into him: &lsquo;Be this truth, we soon shall see.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Pierced, the creature trumpets loudly, shrill as any heron cries,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Moved, then fell upon his haunches neath the weight, and could not rise.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.234}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Pierced and pierced again by the king, this elephant could not endure the pain, and so died; but the king knew not he was dead, and sat there still on his back. Then Kāliṅgabhāradvāja said: &ldquo;O great king! Your elephant is dead; pass on to another.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this matter, the Teacher recited the tenth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;When Kāliṅgabhāradvāja saw the elephant was dead,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He in fear and trepidation then to king Kāliṅga said:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seek another, mighty monarch: this your elephant is dead.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.235}</span></p>
<p class="p6">By the virtue and magical power of the king, another beast of the Uposatha breed appeared and offered his back. The king sat on his back. At that moment the dead elephant fell upon the earth.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this matter, the Teacher repeated another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;This heard, Kāliṅga in dismay</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mounted another, and straightway</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Upon the earth the corpse sank down,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And the soothsayer&rsquo;s word for very truth was shown.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thereupon the king came down from the air, and beholding the precinct of the Bodhi tree, and the miracle that was done, he praised Bhāradvāja, saying:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;To Kāliṅgabhāradvāja king Kāliṅga thus did say:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All you know and you understand, and you see all alway.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now the brahmin would not accept this praise; but standing in his own humble place, he extolled the Buddhas, and praised them. <span class="t18">[4.148]</span></p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher repeated these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;But the brahmin straight denied it, and thus spake unto the king:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I know truth of marks and tokens: but the Buddhas, every thing.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. Though all-knowing and all-seeing, yet in marks they have no skill:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They know all, but know by insight: I a man of books am still.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king, hearing the virtues of the Buddhas, was delighted in heart; and he caused all the dwellers in the world to bring fragrant wreaths in plenty, and for seven days he made them do worship at the circuit of the Great Bodhi tree. <span class="t18">{4.236}</span></p>
<p class="p7">By way of explanation, the Teacher recited a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11019"></a><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;Thus worshipped he the Bodhi tree</span><a id="a11020"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16134"><span class="t19">{904}</span></a><span class="t12"> with much melodious sound</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of music, and with fragrant wreaths: a wall he set around,&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">and after that the king went on his way:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;Brought flowers in sixty thousand carts an offering to be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus king Kāliṅga worshipped the circuit of the tree.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Having in this manner done worship to the Great Bodhi tree, he visited his parents, and took them back with him again to Dantapura; where he gave alms and did good deeds, until he was born again in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having finished this discourse, said: &ldquo;It is not now the first time, monks, that Ānanda did worship the Bodhi tree, but previously also,&rdquo; and then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was Kāliṅga, and I myself was Kāliṅgabhāradvāja.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Sakka, the lord of beings.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about a generous donor who lived in Sāvatthi. This man, so it is said, invited the Teacher, and for seven days gave many gifts to the company which followed with him; on the last day he presented the company of the Ariya Saṅgha with all things necessary for them. Then said the </span><span class="t18">[4.149]</span><a id="a11029"></a><span class="t30"> Teacher, rendering thanks to him, &ldquo;Lay brother, great is your generosity: a thing most difficult you have done. This custom of giving is the custom of wise men of old. Gifts must be given, be you in the world, be you in retirement from the world; the wise men of old, even when they had left the world and dwelt in the woodland, when they had to eat but Kāra</span><a id="a11030"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16136"><span class="t9">{905}</span></a><span class="t30"> leaves sprinkled with water, without salt or spice, </span><span class="t18">{4.237}</span><span class="t30"> yet gave to all beggars that passed by to serve their need, and themselves lived on their own joy and blessedness.&rdquo; The man answered, &ldquo;Sir, this giving of all necessary things to the company is clear enough, but what you say is not clear. Will you not explain it to us?&rdquo; Then the Teacher at his request told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11031"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in the family of a brahmin magnate, whose fortune amounted to eighty crores. They named him Akitti. When the time came he was able to walk, a sister was born, and they gave her the name Yasavatī. The Great Being proceeded at the age of sixteen years to Taxila, where he completed his education and then returned. After that his mother and father died. He had performed all that behoves for the spirits of the dead, and was inspecting his treasure: &ldquo;So and so,&rdquo; ran the catalogue, &ldquo;laid up so much and died, such another so much.&rdquo; Hearing this he was disturbed in his mind, and thought: &ldquo;This treasure is here for all to see, but they that gathered it are no more seen: they have all gone and left the treasure behind them, but when I pass away I will take it with me.&rdquo; So sending for his sister, he said: &ldquo;Take charge of this treasure.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is your own intent?&rdquo; she asked. He replied, &ldquo;To become an ascetic.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear one,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I will not take on my head that which you have spewed out of your mouth; I will have none of it, but I also will become an ascetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11032"></a>Then having asked leave of the king, he caused the drum to beat all about the city, and proclamation to be made, &ldquo;Oyez! Let all those who wish for money repair to the wise man&rsquo;s house!&rdquo; For seven days he distributed great store of alms, and yet the treasure did not come to an end. Then he thought to himself, &ldquo;The elements of my being waste away, and what do I want with this treasure-game? Let those who desire it, take.&rdquo; Then he opened wide the doors of the house, saying: &ldquo;It is a gift; let the people take it.&rdquo; So leaving the house with all its gold and precious metal, with his kinsfolk weeping around, he and his sister departed. And the gate of Benares by which they went was called Akitti&rsquo;s Gate, and the landing-stage by which they went down to the river, this also was called the Quay of Akitti. Three leagues he traversed, and there in a pleasant spot made a hut of leaves and branches, and with his sister lived in it as an ascetic. <span class="t18">[4.150]</span> <span class="t18">{4.238}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11033"></a>After the time of his retiring from the world, many others also did the same, villagers, townsfolk, citizens of the royal city; great was the company of them, great the gifts and the honour they received; it was like to the arising of a Buddha. Then the Great Being thought within himself, &ldquo;Here is great honour and store of alms, here is a great company, yes passing great, but I ought to dwell alone.&rdquo; So at a time when no man expected, without even warning his sister, alone he departed, and by and by came to the kingdom Damiḷa,<a id="a11034"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16139"><span class="t9">{906}</span></a><a id="a11035"></a><a id="a11036"></a> where dwelling in a park near Kāvīrapaṭṭana, he cultivated the Absorptions and the Super Knowledges. There also he received much honour and great store of gifts. This he did not like, and he forsook it, and passing through the air descended at the isle of Kāra, which is over against the island of Nāga.<a id="a11037"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16141"><span class="t9">{907}</span></a> At that time, Kāradīpa was named Ahidīpa, the Isle of Snakes. There he built a hermitage beside a great kāra tree, and dwelt in it. But that he dwelt there no man knew.</p>
<p class="p7">Now his sister went searching for her brother, and in due course came to the kingdom of Damiḷa, saw him not, yet dwelt in the very place where he dwelt, but could not induce the Absorption. The Great Being was so contented that he went nowhere, but at the time of fruit fed upon the fruit of that tree, and at time of the putting forth of leaves fed on its leaves sprinkled with water. By the fire of his virtue Sakka&rsquo;s marble throne became hot. &ldquo;Who would bring me down from my place?&rdquo; thought Sakka, and considering, he beheld the wise man. &ldquo;Why is it,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;that ascetic guards his virtue? Is it that he aspires to become Sakka, or for some other cause? I will test him. The man lives in misery, eats kāra-leaves sprinkled with water: if he desires to become Sakka, he will give me his own sodden leaves; but if not, then he will not give them.&rdquo; Then in the guise of a brahmin he went to the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta sat at the door of his leaf-hut, having sodden the leaves and laid them down, &ldquo;When they are cool,&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;I will eat them.&rdquo; At that moment Sakka stood before him, craving alms. When the Great Being beheld him, he was glad at heart, &ldquo;A blessing for me,&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;I see a beggar; this day I shall attain the desire of my heart, <span class="t18">{4.239}</span> and I shall give an alms.&rdquo; When the food was ready, he took it in his bowl at once, and advancing towards Sakka, said to him, &ldquo;This is my gift: be it the means of my gaining omniscience!&rdquo; Then without leaving any for himself, he laid the food in the other&rsquo;s bowl. The brahmin took it, and moving a short way off disappeared.</p>
<p class="p7">But the Great Being, having given his gift, cooked no more again, but sat still in joy and blessedness. Next day he cooked again, and sat as before at <span class="t18">[4.151] </span>the entrance to the hut. Again Sakka came in the semblance of a brahmin, and again the Great Being gave him the meal, and continued in joy and blessedness. On the third day again he gave as before, saying: &ldquo;See what a blessing for me! A few kāra-leaves have begotten great merit for me.&rdquo; Thus in heartfelt joy, weak as he was for want of food for three days, he came out of his hut at noontide and sat in the door, reflecting upon the gift which he had given.</p>
<p class="p7">And Sakka thought: &ldquo;This brahmin fasting for three days, weak as he is, yet gives to me, and takes joy in his giving. There is no other meaning in his thoughts; I do not understand what it is he desires and why he gives these gifts, so I must ask him, and find out his meaning, and learn the cause of his giving.&rdquo; Accordingly he waited till past midday, and in great glory and magnificence came to the Great Being blazing like the young sun; and standing before him, put to him the question, &ldquo;Ho, ascetic! Why do you practise the ascetic life in this forest, surrounded by the salt sea, with hot winds beating upon you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">To make clear this matter, the Teacher repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Sakka, the lord of beings, saw Akitti honouréd:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Why, O great brahmin, do you rest here in the heat&rsquo;? he said.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the Great Being heard this, and perceived that it was Sakka, he answered and said to him, &ldquo;Those Attainments I do not crave; but craving for omniscience I live the life of a recluse.&rdquo; To make this clear, he recited the second verse: <span class="t18">{4.240}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Rebirth, the body&rsquo;s breaking up, death, delusion is pain:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Therefore, O Sakka Vāsava! I here in peace remain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing these words, Sakka was pleased in his heart, and thought: &ldquo;He is dissatisfied with all kinds of being, and for Nibbāna&rsquo;s sake dwells in the forest. I will offer him a boon.&rdquo; Then he invited him to choose a boon in the words of the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Fair spoken, Kassapa, well put, most excellently said:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11038"></a><span class="t12">Choose now a boon &ndash; as bids your heart, so let the choice be made.&rdquo;</span><a id="a11039"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16143"><span class="t19">{908}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being repeated the fourth verse, choosing his boon:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11040"></a><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Sakka, the lord of beings all, has offered me a boon,</span><a id="a11041"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16145"><span class="t19">{909}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Son, wife or treasure, grain in store, content not though possessed:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I pray no lust for such as these may harbour in my breast.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.152]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka, much pleased, offered yet other boons, and the Great Being accepted them, each in turn repeating a verse as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11042"></a><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Fair spoken, Kassapa, well put, most excellently said:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Choose now a boon &ndash; as bids your heart, so let the choice be made.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Sakka, the lord of beings all, has offered me a boon.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lands, goods, and gold, slaves, horse, and kine, grow old and pass away:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May I be not like them, nor be this fault in me, I pray.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Fair spoken, Kassapa, well put, most excellently said:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Choose now a boon &ndash; as bids your heart, so let the choice be made.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Sakka, the lord of all the world, has offered me a boon.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May I not see or hear a fool, nor no such dwell with me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor hold no converse with a fool, nor like his company.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.241}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;What has a fool e&rsquo;er done to you, O Kassapa, declare!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come tell me why fools&rsquo; company is more than you can bear?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;The fool does wickedly, binds loads on him that none should bear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ill-doing is his good, he is angry when spoken fair,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a11055"></a><a id="a11056"></a><span class="t30">During one rainy season the two chief disciples,</span><a id="a11057"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16151"><span class="t9">{911}</span></a><span class="t30"> desiring to leave the multitude and to dwell apart, took leave of the Teacher, and went into the kingdom where Kokālika was. They repaired to the residence of Kokālika, and said this to him, &ldquo;Monk Kokālika, </span><span class="t18">{4.243}</span><span class="t30"> since for us it is delightful to dwell with you, and for you to dwell with us, we would abide here three months.&rdquo; &ldquo;How,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;will it be delightful for you to dwell with me?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;If you tell not a soul that the two chief disciples are dwelling here, we shall be happy, and that will be our delight in dwelling with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;And how is it delightful for me to dwell with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;We will teach the Dhamma to you for three months in your home, and we will discourse to you, and that will be your delight in dwelling with us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dwell here, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so long as you will,&rdquo; and he allotted a pleasant residence to them. There they dwelt in the fruition of the Attainments, and no man knew of their dwelling in that place.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When they had thus past the rains they said to him, &ldquo;Monk, now we have dwelt with you, and we will go to visit the Teacher,&rdquo; and asked his leave to go. He agreed, and went with them on the rounds for alms in a village over against the place where they were. After their meal the elders departed from the village. Kokālika leaving them, turned back and said to the people, &ldquo;Lay brethren, you are like brute animals. Here the two chief disciples have been dwelling for three months in the monastery opposite, and you knew nothing of it: now they are gone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did you not tell us, sir?&rdquo; the people asked.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then they took ghee and oil and medicines, raiment and clothes, and approached the elders, saluting them and saying: &ldquo;Pardon us, sirs we knew not you were the chief disciples, we have learned it but today by the words of the venerable monk Kokālika. Pray have compassion on us, and receive these medicines and clothes.&rdquo; Kokālika went after the elders with them, for he thought: &ldquo;The elders are frugal, and content with little; they will not accept these things, and then they will be given to me.&rdquo; But the elders, because the gift was offered at the instigation of a monk, neither accepted the things themselves nor had them given to Kokālika. The lay folk then said: &ldquo;Sirs, if you will not accept these, come here once again to bless us.&rdquo; The elders promised, and proceeded to the Teacher&rsquo;s presence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now Kokālika was angry, because the elders neither accepted those things themselves, nor had them given to him. The elders, however, having remained a short while with the Teacher, each chose five hundred monks as their following, and with these thousand monks went on pilgrimage seeking alms, as far as Kokālika&rsquo;s country. The lay folk came out to meet them, and led them to the same monastery, and showed them great honour day by day. </span><span class="t18">{4.244}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Great was the store given them of clothes and of medicines. Those monks who went out with the elders dividing the garments gave of them to all the monks which had come, but to Kokālika gave none, neither did the elders give him any. Getting no clothes Kokālika began to abuse and revile the </span><span class="t18">[4.154]</span><span class="t30"> elders, &ldquo;Sāriputta and Moggallāna are full of wicked desire; they would not accept before what was offered them, but these things they do accept. There is no satisfying them, they have no regard for another.&rdquo; But the elders, perceiving that the man was harbouring evil on their account, set out with their followers to depart; nor would they return, not though the people begged them to stay yet a few days longer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then a young monk said: &ldquo;Where shall the elders stay, laymen? Your own particular elder does not wish them to stay here.&rdquo; Then the people went to Kokālika, and said: &ldquo;Sir, we are told you do not wish the elders to stay here. Go to! Either appease them and bring them back, or away with you and live elsewhere!&rdquo; In fear of the people this man went and made his request to the elders. &ldquo;Go back, monk,&rdquo; answered the elders, &ldquo;we will not return.&rdquo; So he, being unable to prevail upon them, returned to the monastery. Then the lay brethren asked him whether the elders had returned. &ldquo;I could not persuade them to return,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why not, monk?&rdquo; they asked. And then they began to think it must be no good monks would dwell there because the man did wrong, and they must get rid of him. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;do not stay here; we have nothing here for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11058"></a><a id="a11059"></a><a id="a11060"></a><a id="a11061"></a><span class="t30">Thus dishonoured by them, he took bowl and robe and went to Jetavana. After saluting the Teacher, he said: &ldquo;Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna are full of wicked desire, they are in the power of wicked desires!&rdquo; The Teacher replied, &ldquo;Say not so, Kokālika; let your heart, Kokālika, have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna; learn that they are good monks.&rdquo; Kokālika said: &ldquo;You believe in your two chief disciples, sir; I have seen it with my own eyes; they have wicked desires, they have secrets within them, they are wicked men.&rdquo; So he said thrice (though the Teacher would have stayed him), then rose from his seat, and departed. Even as he went on his way there arose over all his body boils of the size of a mustard seed, which grew and grew to the size of a ripe seed of the wood apple tree,</span><a id="a11062"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16153"><span class="t9">{912}</span></a><span class="t30"> burst, and blood ran all over him. Groaning he fell by the gate of Jetavana, maddened with pain.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">A great cry arose, and reached even to the Brahmā Realm, &ldquo;Kokālika has reviled the two chief disciples!&rdquo; Then his spiritual teacher, the Brahmā Tudu by name, </span><span class="t18">{4.245}</span><a id="a11063"></a><span class="t30"> learning the fact, came with the intent of appeasing the elders, and said while poised in the air, &ldquo;Kokālika, a cruel thing this you have done; make your peace with the chief disciples.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are you, brother?&rdquo; the man asked. &ldquo;Tudu Brahmā, is my name,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Have you not been declared by the Fortunate One,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;one of those who return not?</span><a id="a11064"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16155"><span class="t9">{913}</span></a><a id="a11065"></a><span class="t30"> That word means that such come not back to this earth. You will become a Yakkha upon a dunghill!&rdquo; Thus he upbraided the Mahābrahmā. And as he could not persuade the man to do as he advised, he replied to him, &ldquo;May you be tormented according to your own word.&rdquo; Then he returned to his abode of bliss. And Kokālika after dying was born again in the Lotus Hell.</span><a id="a11066"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16157"><span class="t9">{914}</span></a><a id="a11067"></a><span class="t30"> That he had been born there the great and mighty Brahmā Sahampati</span><a id="a11068"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16159"><span class="t9">{915}</span></a><span class="t30"> told to the Tathāgata, and the Teacher told it to the monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">In the Dhamma Hall the monks talked of the man&rsquo;s wickedness, &ldquo;Monks, they say Kokālika reviled Sāriputta and Moggallāna, and by the words of his own mouth came to the Lotus Hell.&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and said he, &ldquo;What speak you of, monks, as you sit here?&rdquo; They told him. Then he said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that Kokālika was destroyed by his own word, and out of his own mouth was condemned to misery; it was the same before.&rdquo; And he told them a story.</span><span class="t18"> [4.155]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11069"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, his family priest was tawny-brown<a id="a11070"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16161"><span class="t9">{916}</span></a><a id="a11071"></a> and had lost all his teeth. His wife did wrong with another brahmin. This man was just like the other.<a id="a11072"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16163"><span class="t9">{917}</span></a><a id="a11073"></a> The family priest tried time and again to restrain his wife, but could not. Then he thought: &ldquo;This my enemy I cannot kill with my own hands, but I must devise some plan to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So he came before the king, and said: &ldquo;O king, your city is the chief city of all Jambudīpa, and you are the leading king: but chief king though you are, your southern gate is unlucky, and ill put together.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well now, my teacher, what is to be done?&rdquo; &ldquo;You must bring good luck into it and set it right.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; &ldquo;We must pull down the old door, get new and lucky timbers, do sacrifice to the beings that guard the city, and set up the new one on a lucky conjunction of the stars.&rdquo; &ldquo;So do, then,&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time, the Bodhisatta was a young man named Takkāriya, <span class="t18">{4.246}</span> who was studying under this man.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11074"></a>Now the family priest caused the old gate to be pulled down, and the new was made ready; which done, he went and said to the king, &ldquo;The gate is ready, my lord: tomorrow is an auspicious conjunction; before the morrow is over, we must do sacrifice and set up the new gate.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, my teacher, and what is necessary for the rite?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, a great gate is possessed and guarded by great spirits. A brahmin, tawny-brown and toothless, of pure blood on both sides, must be killed; his flesh and blood must be offered in worship, and his body laid beneath, and the gate raised upon it. This will bring luck to you and your city.&rdquo;<a id="a11075"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16165"><span class="t9">{918}</span></a> &ldquo;Very well, my teacher, have such a brahmin slain, and set up the gate upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The family priest was delighted. &ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall see the back of my enemy!&rdquo; Full of energy he returned to his home, but could not keep a still tongue in his head, and said quickly to his wife, &ldquo;Ah, you foul hag, whom will you have now to take your pleasure with? Tomorrow I shall kill your lover and make sacrifice of him!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why will you kill an innocent man?&rdquo; &ldquo;The king has commanded me to slay and sacrifice a tawny-brown brahmin, and to set up the city gate upon him. <span class="t18">[4.156]</span> Your lover is tawny-brown, and I mean to slay him for the sacrifice.&rdquo; She sent her lover a message, saying: &ldquo;They say the king wishes to slay a tawny-brown brahmin in sacrifice; if you would save your life, flee away in time, and with you all they who are like you.&rdquo; So the man did: the news spread abroad in the city, and all those in the whole city who were tawny-brown fled away.</p>
<p class="p7">The family priest, nothing aware of his enemy&rsquo;s flight, went early next morning to the king, and said: &ldquo;My lord, in such a place is a tawny-brown brahmin to be found; have him taken.&rdquo; The king sent some men for him, but they saw none, and returning informed the king that he was fled away. &ldquo;Search elsewhere,&rdquo; said the king. <span class="t18">{4.247}</span> All over the city they searched, but found none. &ldquo;Search quickly!&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;except for your family priest there is no such other.&rdquo; &ldquo;A family priest,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;cannot be killed.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you say, my lord? According to the family priest, if the gate is not set up today, the city will be in danger. When the family priest explained the matter, he said that if we let this day go by, the auspicious moment will not come again until the end of a year. The city without a gate for a year, what a chance for our enemies! Let us kill someone, and sacrifice by the aid of some other wise brahmin, and set up the gate.&rdquo; &ldquo;But is there another wise brahmin like my teacher?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is, my lord, his pupil, a young man named Takkāriya; make him your family priest and do the lucky ceremony.&rdquo; The king sent for him, and did honour to him, and made him family priest, and commanded to do as had been said.</p>
<p class="p7">The young man went to the gate with a great crowd following. In the king&rsquo;s name they bound and brought the family priest. The Great Being caused a pit to be dug in the place where the gate was to be set up, and a tent to be placed over it, and with his teacher entered into the tent. The teacher beholding the pit, and seeing no escape, said to the Great Being, &ldquo;My aim had succeeded. Fool that I was, I could not keep a still tongue, but hastily told that wicked woman. I have slain myself with my own weapon.&rdquo; Then he recited the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;I spoke in folly, as a frog might call</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Upon snake in the forest: so I fall</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11076"></a><span class="t12">Into this pit, Takkāriyā.</span><a id="a11077"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16167"><span class="t19">{919}</span></a><span class="t12"> How true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Words spoken out of season one must rue!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.248}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the other addressing him, recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;The man who out of season speaks, will go</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like this to ruin, lamentation, woe:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here you should blame yourself, now you must have</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This dug out pit, my teacher, for your grave.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To these words he added yet this, &ldquo;O teacher, not you only, but <span class="t18">[4.157] </span>many another likewise, has come to misery because he set not a watch upon his words.&rdquo; So saying, he told him a story of the past to prove it.</p>
<p class="p7">In the past, they say, there lived a courtesan in Benares named Kālī, and she had a brother named Tuṇḍila. In one day Kālī would earn a thousand pieces of money. Now Tuṇḍila was a debauchee, a drunkard, a gambler; she gave him money, and whatever he got, he wasted. Do what she would to restrain him, restrain him she could not. One day he was beaten at hazard, and lost the very clothes he was clad in. Wrapping about him a rag of loin-cloth, he repaired to his sister&rsquo;s house. But command had been given by her to her serving-maids, <span class="t18">{4.249}</span> that if Tuṇḍila should come, they were to give him nothing, but to take him by the throat and cast him out. And so they did: he stood by the threshold, and moaned.</p>
<p class="p7">Now a certain rich merchant&rsquo;s son, who used constantly to give Kālī a thousand pieces of money, on that day happened to see him, and says he, &ldquo;Why are you weeping, Tuṇḍila?&rdquo; &ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have been beaten at the dice, and came to my sister; and the serving-maids took me by the throat and cast me out.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, stay here,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;and I will speak to your sister.&rdquo; He entered the house, and said: &ldquo;Your brother stands waiting, clad in a rag of loin-cloth. Why do you not give him something to wear?&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I will give nothing. If you are fond of him, give it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Now in that house of ill fame the fashion was this: out of every thousand pieces of money received, five hundred were for the woman, five hundred were the price of clothes, perfumes and garlands; the men who visited that house received garments to clothemselves in, and stayed the night there, then on the next day they put off the garments they had received, and put on those they had brought, and went their ways. On this occasion the merchant&rsquo;s son put on the garments provided for him, and gave his own clothes to Tuṇḍila. He put them on, and with loud shouts hastened to the tavern. But Kālī ordered her women that when the young man should depart next day, they should take away his clothes. Accordingly, when he came forth, they ran up from this side and that, like so many robbers, and took the clothes from him, and stripped him naked, saying: &ldquo;Now, young sir, be off!&rdquo; Thus they got rid of him. Away he went naked: the people made sport of him, and he was ashamed, and lamented, saying: &ldquo;It is my own doing, because I could not keep watch over my lips!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">To make this clear, the Great Being recited the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Why ask of Tuṇḍila how he should fare</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At Kālikā his sister&rsquo;s hands? Now see!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My clothes are gone, naked am I and bare;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis monstrous like what happened late to you.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.250}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Another person relates this story:</p>
<p class="p7">By carelessness of the goat herds, <span class="t18">[4.158] </span>two rams fell fighting on a pasture at Benares. As they were hard at it, a certain fork-tail thought to himself, &ldquo;These two will crack their horns and perish; I must restrain them.&rdquo; So he tried to restrain them by calling out, &ldquo;Uncle, don&rsquo;t fight!&rdquo; Not a word he got from them: in the midst of the battle, mounting first on the back, then on the head, he besought them to stop, but could do nothing. At last he cried, &ldquo;Fight, then, but kill me first!&rdquo; and placed himself between the two heads. They went on butting away at each other. The bird was crushed as by a pounder, and came to destruction by his own act. To explain this other tale the Great Being repeated the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Between two fighting rams a fork-tail flew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though in the fray he had no part nor share.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The two rams&rsquo; heads did crush him then and there.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He in his fate was monstrous like to you!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Another:</p>
<p class="p7">There was a palm tree which the cowherds set great store by. The people of Benares seeing it sent a certain man up the tree to gather fruit. As he was throwing down the fruit, a black snake issuing forth from an anthill began to ascend the tree; they who stood below tried to drive him off by striking at him with sticks and other things, but could not. Then they called out to the other, &ldquo;A snake is climbing the tree!&rdquo; and he in terror uttered a loud cry. Those who stood below seized a stout cloth by the four corners, and bade him fall into the cloth. He let himself drop, and fell in the midst of the cloth between the four of them; swift as the wind he came, and the men could not hold him, <span class="t18">{4.251}</span> but knocked their four heads together and broke them, and so died. To explain this story the Great Being recited the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Four men, to save a fellow from his fate,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Held the four corners of a cloth below.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They all fell dead, each with a broken pate.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">These men were monstrous like to you, I know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Others again tell this:</p>
<p class="p7">Some goat-thieves who lived at Benares having stolen a female goat one night, determined to make a meal in the forest: to prevent her bleating they muffled her snout and tied her up in a bamboo clump. Next day, on their way to kill her, they forgot the chopper. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll kill the goat, and cook her,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;bring the chopper here!&rdquo; But nobody had one. &ldquo;Without a chopper,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we cannot eat the beast, even if we kill her: let her go! This is due to some merit of hers.&rdquo; So they let her go. Now it happened that a worker in bamboos, who had been there for a bundle of them, left a basket-maker&rsquo;s knife there hidden among the leaves, intending to use it when he came again. But the goat, thinking herself to be free, began playing about under the bamboo clump, and kicking with her hind legs made the knife drop. The thieves heard the sound of the falling knife, and on coming to <span class="t18">[4.159] </span><a id="a11078"></a>find out what it was, saw it, to their great delight; then they killed the goat, and ate her flesh.<a id="a11079"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16169"><span class="t9">{920}</span></a> Thus to explain how this female goat was killed by her own act, the Great Being recited the sixth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;A female goat, in a bamboo thicket bound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Frisking about, herself a knife had found.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With that same knife they cut the creature&rsquo;s throat.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">It strikes me you are monstrous like that goat.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.252}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11080"></a>After recounting this, he explained, &ldquo;But they who are moderate of speech, by watching their words have often been freed from the fate of death,&rdquo; and then told a story of Kinnaras.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11081"></a>A hunter, we are told, who lived in Benares, being once in the region of the Himālayas, by some means or other captured a couple of Kinnara who were husband and wife; and them he took and presented to the king. The king had never seen such beings before. &ldquo;Hunter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what kind of creatures are these?&rdquo; Said the man, &ldquo;My lord, these can sing with a honey-voice, they dance delightfully: no men are able to dance or sing as they can.&rdquo; The king bestowed a great reward on the hunter, and commanded the Kinnara to sing and dance. But they thought: &ldquo;If we are not able to convey the full sense of our song, the song will be a failure, they will abuse and hurt us; and then again, those who speak much speak falsely,&rdquo; so for fear of some falsehood or other they neither sang nor danced, for all the king begged them again and again. At last the king grew angry, and said: &ldquo;Kill these creatures, and cook them, and serve them up to me.&rdquo; This command he delivered in the words of the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11082"></a><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;No devas are these neither gandhabbas,</span><a id="a11083"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16173"><span class="t19">{921}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beasts brought by one who fain would fill his purse.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So for my supper let them cook me one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And one for breakfast by the morrow&rsquo;s sun.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11084"></a>Then the Kinnarī thought to herself, &ldquo;Now the king is angry; without doubt he will kill us. Now it is time to speak.&rdquo;And immediately she recited a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;A hundred thousand ditties all sung wrong</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All are not worth a tithe of one good song.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To sing ill is a crime; and this is why</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(Not from folly) Kimpurisa</span><a id="a11085"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16175"><span class="t19">{922}</span></a><span class="t12"> would not try.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.160] {4.253}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king, pleased with the Kinnarī, at once recited a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;She that has spoken, let her go, that she</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The Himālaya hill again may see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But let them take and kill the other one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And for tomorrow&rsquo;s breakfast have him done.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But the other Kinnara thought: &ldquo;If I hold my tongue, surely the king will kill me; now is the time to speak,&rdquo; and then he recited another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11086"></a><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;The kine depend upon the clouds,</span><a id="a11087"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16177"><span class="t19">{923}</span></a><span class="t12"> and men upon the kine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And I, O king! Depend on you, on me this wife of mine.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let one, before he seek the hills, the other&rsquo;s fate divine.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When he had said this, he repeated a couple of verses, to make it clear, that they had been silent not from unwillingness to obey the king&rsquo;s word, but because they saw that speaking would be a mistake.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;O monarch! Other peoples, other ways:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis very hard to keep you clear of blame.</span><span class="t18"> {4.254}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The very thing which for the one wins praise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Another finds reproof for just the same.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11088"></a><span class="t12">12. Some one there is who each man foolish finds;</span><a id="a11089"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16179"><span class="t19">{924}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Each by imagination different still;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All different, many men and many minds,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No universal law is one man&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11090"></a>Said the king, &ldquo;He speaks the truth; &rsquo;tis a sapient Kinnara,&rdquo; and much pleased he recited the last verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;Silent they were, the Kimpurisa and his mate:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And he who now did utter speech for fear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unhurt, free, happy, let him go his gait.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This is the speech brings good, as oft we hear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the king placed the two Kinnara in a golden cage, and sending for the huntsman, made him set them free in the same place where he had caught them.<span class="t18"> {4.255}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Great Being added, &ldquo;See, my teacher! In this manner the Kinnara kept watch on their words, and by speaking at the right time were set free for their well speaking; but you by your ill speaking have come to great misery.&rdquo; Then after showing him this parallel, he comforted him, saying: &ldquo;Fear not, my teacher; I will save your life.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is there indeed a way,&rdquo; asked the other, &ldquo;how you can save me?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;It is not yet the proper conjunction of the planets.&rdquo; He let the day go by, and in <span class="t18">[4.161] </span>the middle watch of the night brought there a dead goat. &ldquo;Go when you will, brahmin, and live,&rdquo; said he, then let him go and never was a soul the wiser. And he did sacrifice with the flesh of the goat, and set up the gate upon it.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that Kokālika was destroyed by his own words, but it was the same before,&rdquo; after which he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Kokālika was the tawny-brown man, and I myself was the wise Takkāriya.&rdquo;</span></p>
