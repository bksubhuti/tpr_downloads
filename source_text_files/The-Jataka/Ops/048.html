<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Rāhula&rsquo;s mother, after ordaining falls ill. Ven. Rāhula asks what is to be done, and she asks for mango juice, which Ven. Sāriputta then brings for her and which cures her. The Buddha tells a story of a queen in the past who desired a &lsquo;middle mango&rsquo; and how a faithful parrot procured one for her.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the ascetic who lived in the garden (uyyāne nivutthatāpaso),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Sāriputta = the ascetic who gave the mango (ambapakkadāyako tāpaso),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Ānanda = the parrot (suka),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Rāhulamātā = the queen (devī).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;There grows a tree.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about the elder Sāriputta giving mango juice to the nun Bimbādevī. When the Supreme Buddha inaugurated the universal reign of the dispensation, while living in a room at Vesāli, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, along with five hundred of the Sākiya clan, asked for initiation, and received initiation and full orders. Afterwards the five </span><a id="a7289"></a><span class="t18">[2.268] </span><span class="t30">hundred nuns became Arahats on hearing the preaching of Nandaka. But when the Teacher was living near Sāvatthi, the mother of Rāhula thought to herself, &ldquo;My husband on embracing the ascetic life has become omniscient; my son too has become an ascetic, and lives with him. What am I to do in the midst of the house? I will enter on this life, and go to Sāvatthi, and I will live looking upon the Supreme Buddha and my son continually.&rdquo; So she betook herself to a nunnery, and entered the order, and went and lived in a cell at Sāvatthi, in company of her teachers and preceptors, beholding the Teacher and her beloved son. The novice Rāhula came and saw his mother.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day, the nun was afflicted with flatulence; </span><span class="t18">{2.393}</span><span class="t30"> and when her son came to see her, she could not get to see him, but some others came and told him she was ill. Then he went in, and asked his mother, &ldquo;What ought you to take?&rdquo; &ldquo;Son,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;at home this pain used to be cured by mango juice flavoured with sugar; but now we live by begging, and where can we get it?&rdquo; Said the novice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it for you,&rdquo; and departed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now the preceptor of his reverence Rāhula was [Sāriputta], the Captain of the Dhamma, his teacher was the great Moggallāna, his uncle was the elder Ānanda, and his father was the Supreme Buddha: thus he had great luck. However, he went to no other save only to his preceptor; and after greeting him, stood before him with a sad look. &ldquo;Why do you seem sad, Rāhula?&rdquo; asked the elder. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;my mother is ill with flatulence.&rdquo; &ldquo;What must she take?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mango juice and sugar does her good.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll get some; don&rsquo;t trouble about it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7290"></a><a id="a7291"></a><span class="t30">So next day he took the lad to Sāvatthi, and seating him in a waiting-room, went up to the palace. The king of Kosala bade the elder be seated. At that very moment the gardener brought a basket of sweet mangoes ripe for food. The king removed the skin, sprinkled sugar, crushed them up himself, and filled the elder&rsquo;s bowl for him. The elder returned to the place of waiting and gave them to the novice, bidding him give them to his mother; and he did so. No sooner had the nun eaten, than her pain was cured. The king also sent messengers, saying: &ldquo;The elder did not sit here to eat the mango juice. Go and find out whether he gave it to any one.&rdquo; The messenger went along with the elder, and found out, and then returned to tell the king. Thought the king, &ldquo;If the Teacher should return to a worldly life, he would be a Universal Monarch; the novice Rāhula would be his treasure the crown prince,</span><a id="a7292"></a><a href="notes.html#a15356"><span class="t9">{533}</span></a><span class="t30"> the holy nun would be his treasure the empress, and all the universe would belong to them. I must go and attend upon them. Now they are living close by there is no time to be lost.&rdquo; So from that day he continually gave mango syrup to the nun.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">It became known among the monks how the elder gave mango syrup to the holy nun. </span><span class="t18">{2.394}</span><span class="t30"> And one day they fell talking in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Friend, I hear that the elder Sāriputta comforted nun Bimbādevī with mango syrup.&rdquo; The Teacher came in and asked, &ldquo;What are you talking about now?&rdquo; When they told him, &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that Rāhula&rsquo;s mother was comforted with mango syrup by the elder; the same happened before,&rdquo; and he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family living in a village of Kāsi. When he grew up, he was educated at Taxila, settled down into family life, and on the death of his parents embraced the ascetic life. After that he remained in the region of the Himālayas, cultivating the Super Knowledges and Attainments. A body of sages gathered round him, and he became their teacher. <span class="t18">[2.269]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7293"></a>At the end of a long time he came down from the hills to get salt and seasoning, and in the course of his wanderings arrived at Benares, where he lived in a park. And at the glory of the virtue of this company of holy men the palace of Sakka shook. Sakka reflected, and perceived what it was. He thought: &ldquo;I will do an injury to their dwelling; then their stay will he disturbed; they will be too much distressed to have tranquillity of mind. Then I shall be comfortable again.&rdquo; As he thought how to do it, he hit upon a plan. &ldquo;I will enter the chamber of the chief queen, just at the middle watch of the night, and hovering in the air, I will say &ndash; &lsquo;Lady, if you eat a midmost mango,<a id="a7294"></a><a href="notes.html#a15358"><span class="t9">{534}</span></a><a id="a7295"></a> you will conceive a son,<a id="a7296"></a><a href="notes.html#a15360"><span class="t9">{535}</span></a> who shall become a Universal Monarch.&rsquo; She will tell the king, and he will send to the orchard for a mango fruit: I will cause all the fruit to disappear. They will tell the king that there is none, and when he asks who eats it, they will say &lsquo;The ascetics.&rsquo; &rdquo; So just in the middle watch, he appeared in the queen&rsquo;s chamber, and hovering in the air, revealed his godhead, and conversing with her, repeated the first two verses: <span class="t18">{2.395}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7297"></a><a id="a7298"></a><span class="t12">1. Abbhantaro nāma dumo, yassa dibyam-idaṁ phalaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7299"></a><a id="a7300"></a><span class="t12">Bhutvā dohaḷinī nārī Cakkavattiṁ vijāyati.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a7301"></a><a id="a7302"></a><span class="t4">The Abbhantara mango tree, which has a fruit that is divine, eating it the pregnant woman gives birth to a Universal Monarch.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7303"></a><span class="t12">2. Tvam-pi bhadde mahesīsi, sā cāpi patino piyā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7304"></a><a id="a7305"></a><span class="t12">Āharissati te rājā idaṁ Abbhantaraṁ phalan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a7306"></a><span class="t4">Lady, you are a great queen, also you are dear to your husband, the king will surely bring the Abbhantara mango fruit to you.</span></p>
<p class="p23">These verses did Sakka recite to the queen; and then bidding her be careful, and make no delay, but tell the matter to the king herself, he encouraged her, and went back to his own place.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day, the queen lay down, as though ill, giving instructions to her maidens. The king sat upon his throne, under the white umbrella, and looked on at the dancing. Not seeing his queen, he asked a handmaid where she was. &ldquo;The queen is sick,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>
<p class="p7">So the king went to see her; and sitting by her side, stroked her back, and asked, &ldquo;What is the matter, lady?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but that I have a craving for something.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it you want, lady?&rdquo; he asked again. &ldquo;A middle mango, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is there such a thing as a middle mango?&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.270]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what a middle mango is; but I know that I shall die if I don&rsquo;t get one.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right, we will get you one; don&rsquo;t trouble about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So the king consoled her, and went away. He took his seat upon the royal divan, and sent for his courtiers. <span class="t18">{2.396}</span> &ldquo;My queen has a great craving for a <span class="t11">middle mango</span>. What is to be done?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p class="p7">Someone told him, &ldquo;A middle mango is one which grows between two others. Send to your park, and find a mango growing between two others; pluck its fruit and let us give it to the queen.&rdquo; So the king sent men to do after this manner.</p>
<p class="p7">But Sakka by his power made all the fruit disappear, as though it had been eaten. The men who came for the mangoes searched the whole park through, and not a mango could they find; so back they went to the king, and told him that mangoes there were none.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Who is it eats the mangoes?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;The ascetics, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Give the ascetics a drubbing, and bundle them out of the park!&rdquo; he commanded. The people heard and obeyed: Sakka&rsquo;s wish was fulfilled. The queen lay on and on, longing for the mango.</p>
<p class="p7">The king could not think what to do. He gathered his courtiers and his brahmins, and asked them, &ldquo;Do you know what a <span class="t11">middle mango</span> is?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Said the brahmins, &ldquo;My lord, a middle mango is the portion of the gods. It grows in the Himālayas, in the Golden Cave. So we have heard by immemorial tradition.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, who can go and get it?&rdquo; &ldquo;A human being cannot go; we must send a young parrot.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">At that time there was a fine young parrot in the king&rsquo;s family, as big as the nave of the wheel in the princes&rsquo; carriage, strong, wise, and had skill in means. This parrot the king sent for, and thus addressed him,</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Dear parrot, I have done a great deal for you: you live in a golden cage; you have sweet grain to eat on a golden dish; you have sugared water to drink. There&rsquo;s something I want you to do for me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Speak on, my lord,&rdquo; said the parrot.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Son, my queen has a craving for a <span class="t11">middle mango</span>; this mango grows in the Himālayas, in the Golden Mountain; it is the gods&rsquo; portion, <span class="t18">{2.397}</span> no human being can go there. You must bring the fruit back from thence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very good, my king, I will,&rdquo; said the parrot. Then the king gave him sweetened grain to eat, on a golden plate, and sugar-water to drink; and anointed him beneath the wings with oil a hundred times refined; then he took him in both hands, and standing at a window, let him fly away. <span class="t18">[2.271]</span></p>
<p class="p7">The parrot, on the king&rsquo;s errand, flew along in the air, beyond the ways of men, till he came to some parrots which dwelt in the first hill-region of the Himālayas. &ldquo;Where is the middle mango?&rdquo; he asked them, &ldquo;tell me the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;We know not,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;but the parrots in the second range of hills will know.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The parrot listened, and flew away to the second range. After that he went on to the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth. There too the parrots said: &ldquo;We do not know, but those in the seventh range will know.&rdquo; So he went on there, and asked where the middle mango tree grew. &ldquo;In such and such a place, on the Golden Hill,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I have come for the fruit of it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;guide me there, and procure the fruit for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7307"></a>&ldquo;That is the portion of the king Vessavaṇa. It is impossible to get near it. The whole tree from the roots upwards is encircled with seven iron nets; it is guarded by thousands of millions of Kumbhaṇḍa Rakkhasas; if they see any one, he&rsquo;s done for. The place is like the fire of the dissolution and the fire of hell. Do not ask such a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;If you will not go with me, then describe the place to me,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p class="p7">So they told him to go by such and such a way. He listened carefully to their instructions. He did not show himself by day; but at dead of night, when the Rakkhasas were asleep, he approached the tree, and began softly to climb on one of its roots, when clink! went the iron net <span class="t18">{2.398} </span>the Rakkhasas awoke &ndash; saw the parrot, and seized him, crying, &ldquo;Thief!&rdquo; Then they discussed what was to be done with him.</p>
<p class="p7">Says one, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw him into my mouth, and swallow him!&rdquo; Says another, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll crush him and knead him in my hands and scatter him in bits!&rdquo; Says a third, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll split him in two, and cook him on the coals and eat him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The parrot heard them deliberating. Without any fear he addressed them, &ldquo;I say, Rakkhasas, whose men are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;We belong to king Vessavaṇa.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, you have one king for your master, and I have another for mine. The king of Benares sent me here to fetch a fruit of the middle mango tree. Then and there I gave my life to my king, and here I am. He who loses his life for parents or master is born at once in heaven. Therefore I shall pass at once from this animal form to the world of the gods!&rdquo; and he repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7308"></a><a id="a7309"></a><a id="a7310"></a><a id="a7311"></a><span class="t12">3. Bhattu-r-atthe parakkanto, yaṁ ṭhānam-adhigacchati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7312"></a><a id="a7313"></a><a id="a7314"></a><a id="a7315"></a><a id="a7316"></a><span class="t12">Sūro attapariccāgī, labhamāno bhavāmahan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a7317"></a><a id="a7318"></a><a id="a7319"></a><a id="a7320"></a><span class="t4">Exerting for the master&rsquo;s sake, whatever position he attains, the self-sacrificing hero, I am the one receiving it.</span><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t47">[2.272]</span></p>
<p class="p23">After this fashion did he discourse, repeating this verse. The Rakkhasas listened, and were pleased in their heart. &ldquo;This is a righteous creature,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we must not kill him &ndash; let him go!&rdquo; So they let him go, and said: &ldquo;I say, parrot, you&rsquo;re free! Go unharmed out of our hands!&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.399}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Do not let me return empty-handed,&rdquo; said the parrot, &ldquo;give me a fruit off the tree!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Parrot,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;it is not our business to give you fruit off this tree. All the fruit on this tree is marked. If there is one fruit wrong we shall lose our lives. If Vessavaṇa is angry and looks but once, a thousand Rakkhasas are broken up and scattered like parched peas hopping about on a hot plate. So we cannot give you any. But we will tell you a place where you can get some.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I care not who gives it,&rdquo; said the parrot, &ldquo;but the fruit I must have. Tell me where I may get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;In one of the tortuous paths of the Golden Mountain lives an ascetic, by name Jotirasa, who watches the sacred fire in a leaf-thatched hut, called Kañcanapatti or Goldleaf, a favourite of Vessavaṇa; and Vessavaṇa sends him constantly four fruits from the tree; go to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The parrot took his leave, and came to the ascetic; he gave him greeting, and sat down on one side. The ascetic asked him, &ldquo;Where have you come from?&rdquo; &ldquo;From the king of Benares.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why are you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Teacher, our queen has a great craving for the fruit of the middle mango, and that is why I am come. Howbeit the Rakkhasas would not give me any themselves, but sent me to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sit down, then, and you shall have one,&rdquo; said the ascetic. Then came the four which Vessavaṇa used to send. The ascetic ate two of them, gave the parrot one to eat, and when this was eaten he hung the fourth by a string, and made it fast around the parrot&rsquo;s neck, and let him go, &ldquo;Off with you, now!&rdquo; said he. The parrot flew back and gave it to the queen. She ate it, and satisfied her craving, but still all the same she had no son. <span class="t18">{2.400}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka in these words, &ldquo;At that time Rāhula&rsquo;s mother was the queen, Ānanda was the parrot, Sāriputta was the ascetic who gave the mango fruit, but the ascetic who lived in the park was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

The Buddha tells a story of how a man intrigued in the palace in Benares, was exiled and enticed a foreign king to attack his former country. The king of Benares, rather than cause the deaths of others, allowed himself to be captured, and the conqueror, seeing his virtue, relented and set him free.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;It is best that you should know.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.273]</span><a id="a7333"></a><a id="a7334"></a><a id="a7335"></a><span class="t30"> This tale the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a courtier of the king of Kosala. This man was very useful to the king, we are told, and did everything that had to be done. Because he was very useful, the king did him great honour. The others were jealous, and concocted a slander, and calumniated him. The king believed their saying, and without enquiring into his guilt, bound him in chains, though virtuous and innocent, and cast him into prison. There he dwelt all alone; but, by reason of his virtue, he had peace of mind, and with mind at peace he understood the conditions of existence, and attained the fruition of the First Path. By and by the king found that he was guiltless, and broke his chains and gave him honour more than before.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7336"></a><span class="t30">The man wished to pay his respects to the Teacher; and taking flowers and perfumes, he went to the monastery, and did reverence to the Tathāgata, and sat respectfully aside. The Teacher talked graciously with him. &ldquo;We have heard that ill fortune befell you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Yes, sir, but I made my ill fortune into good; and as I sat in prison, I produced the fruition of the First Path.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good friend,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;you are not the only one who has turned evil into good; for wise men in the olden time turned evil into good just as you did.&rdquo; And he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as the son of his queen consort. He grew up and was educated at Taxila; and on his father&rsquo;s death he became king, and kept the ten royal rules: he gave alms, practised virtue, <span class="t18">{2.401}</span> and observed the sacred day.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7337"></a>Now one of his courtiers intrigued among the king&rsquo;s wives. The servants noticed it, and told the king that so and so was carrying on an intrigue. The king found out the very truth of the matter, and sent for him. &ldquo;Never show yourself before me again,&rdquo; said he, and banished him. The man went off to the court of a neighbouring king, and then all happened as described above in the Mahāsīlavajātaka [Ja 51].</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7338"></a><span class="t11">Driven thus from the realm, that minister left the Kāsi country, and, entering the service of the king of Kosala, gradually rose to be that monarch&rsquo;s confidential adviser. One day he said to the king of Kosala, &ldquo;Sire, the kingdom of Benares is like a goodly honeycomb untainted by flies; its king is feebleness itself; and a trifling force would suffice to conquer the whole country.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Hereon, the king of Kosala reflected that the kingdom of Benares was large, and, considering this in connection with the advice that a trifling force could conquer it, he grew suspicious that his adviser was a hireling instigated to lead him into a trap. &ldquo;Traitor,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you are paid to say this!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Indeed I am not,&rdquo; answered the other, &ldquo;I do but speak the truth. If you doubt me, send men to massacre a village over his border, and see whether, when they are caught and brought before him, the king does not let them off scot-free and even load them with gifts.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;He shows a very bold front in making his assertion,&rdquo; thought the king, &ldquo;I will test his counsel without delay.&rdquo; And accordingly he sent some of his creatures to harry a village across the Benares border. The ruffians were captured and brought before the king of Benares, who asked them, saying: &ldquo;My children, why have you killed my villagers?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Because we could not make a living,&rdquo; said they.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Then why did you not come to me?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;See that you do not do the like again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">And he gave them presents and sent them away. Back they went and told this to the king of Kosala. But this evidence was not enough to nerve him to the expedition; and a second band was sent to massacre another village, this time in the heart of the kingdom. These too were likewise sent away with presents by the king of Benares. But even this evidence was not deemed strong enough; and a third party was sent to plunder the very streets of Benares! And these, like their forerunners, were sent away with presents!</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7339"></a>Having thrice tested him, the king, believing the word of the courtier came with a great army before Benares with intent to take it. When this was known to the chief warriors of the king of Benares, five hundred in number, they said to the king, &ldquo;Such and such a king has come here, wasting the country, with intent to take Benares &ndash; here, let us go and capture him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I want no kingdom that must be kept by doing harm,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Do nothing at all.&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.274]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7340"></a>The marauding king surrounded the city. Again the courtiers approached the king, and said: &ldquo;My lord, be advised &ndash; let us capture him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Nothing can be done,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Open the city gates.&rdquo; Then, surrounded by his court, he sat down in state upon the great dais.</p>
<p class="p7">The marauder entered the town, felling the men at the four gates and ascended the terrace. There he took prisoner the king with all his court, threw chains upon them and cast them into prison. The king, as he sat in prison, pitied the marauder, and an Absorption based on loving-kindness was stirred in him. By reason of this pity, the other king felt great torment in his body; he burnt all through as though with a twofold flame; and smitten with great pain, he asked what the matter was.</p>
<p class="p7">They replied, &ldquo;You have cast a righteous king into prison, that is why this is come upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">He went and craved pardon of the Bodhisatta, and restored his kingdom, saying: &ldquo;Your kingdom be your own. <span class="t18">{2.402}</span> Henceforward leave your enemies for me to deal with.&rdquo; He punished the evil counsellor, and returned to his own city.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta sat in state upon his high dais, in festal array, with his court around him; and addressing them repeated the first two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7341"></a><a id="a7342"></a><a id="a7343"></a><a id="a7344"></a><a id="a7345"></a><a id="a7346"></a><span class="t12">1. Seyyaṁso seyyaso hoti yo seyyam-upasevati,</span></p>

<p class="p23">Thus the Great Being praised virtue in the way of pitying the great multitude; and leaving the white umbrella in the great city of Benares, twelve leagues in extent, retired to the Himālayas, and embraced the ascetic life. <span class="t18">{2.403}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, after Fully Awakening, repeated the third verse:</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a7370"></a><span class="t4">Having said this, I, the great king Kaṁsa, who had seized Benares, laying down my bow and quiver, entered upon moral restraint.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the marauding king, but the king of Benares was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;The best, the best you always.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.275]</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told in Jetavana about the elder Dhanuggahatissa. Mahākosala, the father of king Pasenadi, when he married his daughter, the lady Kosalā, to king Bimbisāra, gave a village of Kāsi, producing a revenue of a hundred thousand, for bath and perfume money. When Ajātasattu murdered the king his father, the lady Kosala died of grief. Then thought king Pasenadi, &ldquo;Ajātasattu has killed his father, my sister has died from sympathy with her husband&rsquo;s misfortune; I will not give the Kāsi town to the parricide.&rdquo; So he refused to give it to Ajātasattu. About this village there was war betwixt these two from time to time. Ajātasattu was fierce and strong, and Pasenadi was a very old man, so he was beaten again and again, and the people of Mahākosala were generally conquered.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the king asked his courtiers, &ldquo;We are constantly being beaten; what is to be done?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;the venerable fathers are skilled in incantations. We must hear the word of the monks who dwell in Jetavana.&rdquo; Then the king dispatched couriers, bidding them listen to the converse of the monks at a suitable time.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7382"></a><span class="t30">Now at the time there were two old elders living in a leaf-hut close to the monastery, whose names were elder Utta and elder Dhanuggahatissa. </span><span class="t18">{2.404}</span><span class="t30"> Dhanuggahatissa had slept through the first and second watch of the night; and awaking in the last watch, he broke some sticks, lit a fire, and sitting down said: &ldquo;Utta, my friend!&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it, friend Tissa?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you not asleep?&rdquo; &ldquo;Now we are awake, what&rsquo;s to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Get up, now, and sit by me.&rdquo; So he did, and began to talk to him. &ldquo;That stupid, pot-bellied Kosala never has a jar full of boiled rice without letting it spoil; how to plan a war he knows not a bit. He is always being beaten and forced to pay.&rdquo; &ldquo;But what should he do?&rdquo; Now just then the couriers stood listening to their talk.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7383"></a><a id="a7384"></a><span class="t30">The elder Dhanuggahatissa discussed the nature of war. &ldquo;War, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;consists of three kinds: the lotus army, the wheel army, and the wagon army.</span><a id="a7385"></a><a href="notes.html#a15362"><span class="t9">{536}</span></a><span class="t30"> If those who wish to capture Ajātasattu will post garrisons in two hill-forts right away in the hills, and pretend that they are weak, and watch till they get him among the hills, and bar his passage, leap out from the two forts and take him in front and in the rear, and shout aloud, they will quickly have him like a landed fish, like a frog in the fist; and so they will be able to secure him.&rdquo; All this the couriers told their king. The king caused the drum to be beaten for the attack, arranged his army wagon-wise, took Ajātasattu alive; his daughter, princess Vajirā he gave in marriage to his sister&rsquo;s son, and dismissed her with the Kāsi village for her bath-money.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This event became known among the Saṅgha. One day, they were all talking about it in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Friend, I hear that the king of Kosala conquered Ajātasattu through the instructions of Dhanuggahatissa.&rdquo; The Teacher </span><span class="t18">[2.276] </span><span class="t30">came in, &ldquo;What do you sit here talking about now, monks?&rdquo; asked he. They told him. He said: &ldquo;This is not the first time that Dhanuggahatissa was clever in discussing war,&rdquo; and he told them a story. </span><span class="t18">{2.405}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a Tree Devatā. At that time there were some carpenters settled in a village near Benares. One of them, on going into the forest to get wood, found a young boar fallen in a pit, which he took home and kept. He grew big, with curved tusks, and was a well-mannered creature. Because the carpenter kept him, he went by the name of Carpenter&rsquo;s Boar [Vaḍḍhakisūkara]. When the carpenter was chopping up a tree, the boar used to turn the tree over with his snout, and with his teeth fetch hatchet and adze, chisel and mallet, and pull along the measuring line by the end. The carpenter was afraid somebody might eat him up; so he took him and let him go in the forest. The boar ran into the forest, looking for a safe and pleasant place to live in; and at last he espied a great cave up in a mountain side, with plenty of bulbs, and roots, and fruits, a pleasant living-place. Some hundreds of other boars saw him and approached him.</p>
<p class="p7">Said he to them, &ldquo;You are just what I am looking for, and here I have found you. This seems a nice place; and here I mean to live now with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;A nice place it certainly is,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;but dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as soon as I saw you, I wondered how it was that those who dwell in so plentiful a place could be so meagre in flesh and blood. What is it you are afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7386"></a>&ldquo;There is a tiger comes in the morning, and every one he sees he seizes and carries off.&rdquo; &ldquo;Does this always happen, or only now and then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Always.&rdquo; &ldquo;How many tigers are there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Only one.&rdquo; &ldquo;What &ndash; one alone too many for all of you!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll catch him, if you only do what I tell you. Where does this tiger live?&rdquo; &ldquo;On that hill yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So at night he drilled the boars and prepared them for war; explaining to them the science. <span class="t18">{2.406}</span><a id="a7387"></a> &ldquo;War is of three kinds &ndash; the lotus army, the wheel army, and the wagon army,&rdquo; and he arranged them after the lotus pattern. He knew the place of vantage; so, said he, &ldquo;Here we must set our battle.&rdquo; The mothers and their suckling brood he placed <span class="t18">[2.277] </span><a id="a7388"></a>in the middle; around these he put the sows that had no young; around these, the little boars; around these, those which were rather young; around these, all whose tusks were grown; around these, the boars fit for battle, strong and powerful, by tens and by twenties; thus he placed them in serried ranks. Before his own position he had a round hole dug; behind it, a pit getting gradually deeper and deeper, shaped like a winnowing basket.<a id="a7389"></a><a href="notes.html#a15365"><span class="t9">{537}</span></a> As he moved about amongst them, followed by sixty or seventy boars, bidding them be of good courage, the dawn broke.</p>
<p class="p7">The tiger awoke. &ldquo;Time now!&rdquo; thought he. He trotted up till he caught sight of them; then stopped still upon the plateau, glaring at the crowd of boars. &ldquo;Glare back!&rdquo; cried the Carpenter&rsquo;s Boar, with a signal to the rest. They all glared. The tiger opened his mouth, and drew a long breath: the boars all did the same. The tiger relieved himself: so did the boars. Thus whatever the tiger did, the boars did after him.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s this!&rdquo; the tiger wondered. &ldquo;They used to take to their heels as soon as they saw me &ndash; indeed, they were too much frightened even to run. Now so far from running, they actually stand up against me! Whatever I do, they mimic. There&rsquo;s a fellow yonder on a commanding position: he it is who has organised the rabble. Well, I don&rsquo;t see how to get the better of them.&rdquo; And he turned away and went back to his lair.</p>
<p class="p7">Now there was a sham ascetic, who used to get a share of the tiger&rsquo;s prey. This time the tiger returned empty-handed. Noticing this, the ascetic repeated the following verse. <span class="t18">{2.407}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7390"></a><a id="a7391"></a><a id="a7392"></a><a id="a7393"></a><span class="t12">1. Varaṁ varaṁ tvaṁ nihanaṁ pure cari,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Balaṁ nu te byaggha na cajja vijjatī&rdquo; ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a7400"></a><a id="a7401"></a><a id="a7402"></a><a id="a7403"></a><span class="t4">You wandered before destroying the best, having overcome the boar in this place, now alone, having departed, you brood, tiger, why is your strength not found today?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p23">At this address, the tiger repeated another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7404"></a><a id="a7405"></a><span class="t12">2. Ime sudaṁ yanti disodisaṁ pure,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7406"></a><a id="a7407"></a><span class="t12">Bhayaṭṭitā leṇagavesino puthū,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Te dāni saṅgamma vasanti ekato,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a7411"></a><span class="t4">Before these surely go from place to place, afraid, troubled, they sought out their own caves, now, having gathered, they dwell together, standing they are hard for me to conquer.</span></p>
<p class="p23">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be afraid of them!&rdquo; urged the ascetic. &ldquo;One roar and one leap will frighten them out of their wits, and send them pell-mell.&rdquo; The tiger yielded to this insistence. Plucking up his courage, he went back and stood upon the plateau.</p>
<p class="p7">Carpenter&rsquo;s Boar stood between the two pits. &ldquo;See Teacher! Here&rsquo;s the scoundrel again!&rdquo; cried the boars. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we have him now.&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.278]</span></p>
<p class="p7">With a roar the tiger leapt upon Carpenter&rsquo;s Boar. At the very instant he sprang, <span class="t18">{2.408}</span><a id="a7412"></a> the boar dodged and dropped straight into the round hole. The tiger could not stop, but tumbled over and over and fell all of a heap in the jaws of the other pit, where it got very narrow. Up jumped the boar out of his hole, and quick as lightning ran his tusk into the tiger&rsquo;s thighs, tore him about the kidneys, buried his fangs in the creature&rsquo;s sweet flesh, and wounded his head. Then he tossed him out of the pit, crying aloud, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your enemy for you!&rdquo; They who came first had tiger to eat; but they who came after went about sniffing at the others&rsquo; mouths, and asking what tiger&rsquo;s flesh tasted like!</p>
<p class="p7">But the boars were still uneasy. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; asked our hog, who had noticed their movements.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all very well to kill one tiger, but the sham ascetic can bring ten tigers more!&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; &ldquo;A wicked ascetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;The tiger I have killed; do you suppose a man can hurt me? Come along, and we&rsquo;ll get hold of him.&rdquo; So they all set forth.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the man had been wondering why the tiger was so long in coming. &ldquo;Could the boars have caught him?&rdquo; he thought. At last he started to meet him on the way; and as he went, there came the boars! He snatched up his belongings, and off he ran. The boars tore after him. He threw away his encumbrances, and with all speed climbed up a fig tree.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Now, Teacher, it&rsquo;s all up!&rdquo; cried the herd. &ldquo;The man has climbed a tree!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What tree?&rdquo; their leader asked.</p>
<p class="p7">They replied, &ldquo;A fig tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; said the leader. &ldquo;The sows must bring water, the young ones dig about the tree, the tuskers tear at the roots, and the rest surround it and watch.&rdquo; They did their several tasks as he bade them; he meanwhile charged full at a great thick root, <span class="t18">{2.409}</span> &rsquo;twas like an axe-blow; and with this one blow he felled the tree to the ground. The boars who were waiting for the man, knocked him down, tore him to pieces, gnawed the bones clean in a moment!</p>
<p class="p7">Now they perched Carpenter&rsquo;s Boar on the tree-trunk. They filled the dead man&rsquo;s shell with water, and sprinkled the boar to consecrate him for their king; a young sow they consecrated to be his consort.</p>
<p class="p7">This, the saying goes, is the origin of the custom still observed. When people make a king now-a-days, he is placed on a fine chair of fig-wood, and sprinkled out of three shells.</p>
<p class="p7">A Devatā that dwelt in that forest beheld this marvel. Appearing <span class="t18">[2.279] </span>before the boars in a cleft of his tree-trunk, he repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7413"></a><a id="a7414"></a><a id="a7415"></a><span class="t12">3. Namatthu saṅghāna&rsquo; samāgatānaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p23"><span class="t30">After this discourse the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Dhanuggaha the elder was the Carpenter&rsquo;s Boar, and I was the Tree Devatā.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a7432"></a><span class="t15">In the present a Devatā works to dissuade her landlord, Anāthapiṇḍika, from his allegiance to the Buddha, and is expelled from her home for the trouble. To make up she recovers three great fortunes her host had lost. A brahmin then tries to steal Anāthapiṇḍika&rsquo;s luck, but fails. When the Buddha hears of this he tells a story about an elephant trainer who had his share of a bird who could bring good luck and three days later became king.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Whatever riches they who strive.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told about a brahmin who stole good luck. </span><span class="t18">{2.410}</span><a id="a7436"></a><a id="a7437"></a><span class="t30"> The circumstances of this birth-tale are given above in the Khadiraṅgajātaka [Ja 40].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7438"></a><span class="t34">For Anāthapiṇḍika, who had lavished fifty-four crores on the dispensation of the Buddha over the monastery alone, and who valued naught else save only the Three Jewels, used to go every day while the Teacher was at Jetavana to attend the Great Services &ndash; once at daybreak, once after breakfast, and once in the evening. There were intermediate services too; but he never went empty-handed, for fear the novices and lads should look to see what he had brought with him. When he went in the early morning, he used to have rice-gruel taken up; after breakfast, ghee, butter, honey, molasses, and the like; and in the evening, he brought perfumes, garlands and cloths. So much did he expend day after day, that his expense knew no bounds. Moreover, many traders borrowed money from him on their bonds &ndash; to the amount of eighteen crores; and the great merchant never called the money in. Furthermore, another eighteen crores of the family property, which were buried in the riverbank, were washed out to sea, when the bank was swept away by a storm; and down rolled the brazen pots, with fastenings and seals unbroken, to the bottom of the ocean. In his house, too, there was always rice standing ready for 500 monks &ndash; so that the merchant&rsquo;s house was to the Saṅgha like a pool dug where four roads meet, yes, like mother and father was he to them. Therefore, even the Supreme Buddha used to go to his house, and the Eighty Chief Elders too; and the number of other monks passing in and out was beyond measure.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now his house was seven stories high and had seven portals; and over the fourth gateway dwelt a Devatā who was a heretic. When the Supreme Buddha came into the house, she could not stay in her abode on high, but came down with her children to the ground-floor; and she had to do the same whenever the Eighty Chief Elders or the other elders came in and out. Thought she, &ldquo;So long as the ascetic Gotama and his disciples keep coming into this house I can have no peace here; I can&rsquo;t be eternally coming downstairs to the ground floor. I must contrive to stop them from coming any more to this house.&rdquo; So one day, when the business manager had retired to rest, she appeared before him in visible shape.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;the Devatā who lives over the fourth gateway.&rdquo; &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see what the merchant is doing. Heedless of his own future, he is drawing upon his resources, only to enrich the ascetic Gotama. He engages in no commerce; he undertakes no business. Advise the merchant to attend to his business, and arrange that the ascetic Gotama with his disciples shall come no more into the house.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then said he, &ldquo;Foolish Devatā, if the merchant does spend his money, he spends it on the dispensation of the Buddha, which leads to safety. Even if he were to seize me by the hair and sell me for a slave, I will say nothing. Begone!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Another day, she went to the merchant&rsquo;s eldest son and gave him the same advice. And he flouted her in just the same manner. But to the merchant himself she did not so much as dare to speak on the matter.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now by dint of unending munificence and of doing no business, the merchant&rsquo;s incomings diminished and his estate grew less and less; so that he sank by degrees into poverty, and his table, his dress, and his bed and food were no longer what they had once been. Yet, in spite of his altered circumstances, be continued to entertain the Saṅgha, though he was no longer able to feast them. So one day when he had made his bow and taken his seat, the Teacher said to him, &ldquo;Householder, are gifts being given at your house?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s only a little sour husk-porridge, left over from yesterday.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be not distressed, householder, at the thought that you can only offer what is unpalatable. If the heart be good, the food given to Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, and their disciples, cannot but be good too. And why? Because of the greatness of the fruit thereof. For he who can make his heart acceptable cannot give an unacceptable gift &ndash; as is to be testified by the following passage:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><a id="a7439"></a><span class="t37">For, if the heart have faith, no gift is small</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">To Buddhas or to their disciples true.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">&rsquo;Tis said no service can be reckoned small</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">That&rsquo;s paid to Buddhas, lords of great renown.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">Mark well what fruit rewarded that poor gift</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">Of pottage &ndash; dried-up, sour, and lacking salt.&rdquo;</span><a id="a7440"></a><a href="notes.html#a15367"><span class="t49">{538}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t34">Also, he said this further thing, &ldquo;Householder, in giving this unpalatable gift, you are giving it to those who have entered on the Noble Eightfold Path. Whereas I, when in Velāma&rsquo;s time I stirred up all Jambudīpa by giving the seven things of price, and in my largesse poured them forth as though I had made into one mighty stream the five great rivers &ndash; I yet found none who had reached the Three Refuges or kept the Five Precepts; for rare are those who are worthy of offerings. Therefore, let not your heart be troubled by the thought that your gift is unpalatable.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated the Velāmakasutta [AN 9.20].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7441"></a><a id="a7442"></a><span class="t34">Now that Devatā who had not dared to speak to the merchant in the days of his magnificence, thought that now he was poor he would hearken to her, and so, entering his chamber at dead of night she appeared before him in visible shape, standing in mid-air. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the merchant, when he became aware of her presence. &ldquo;I am the Devatā, great merchant, who dwells over the fourth gateway.&rdquo; &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;To give you counsel.&rdquo; &ldquo;Proceed, then.&rdquo; &ldquo;Great merchant, you take no thought for your own future or for your own children. You have expended vast sums on the dispensation of the ascetic Gotama; in fact, by long-continued expenditure and by not undertaking new business you have been brought by the ascetic Gotama to poverty. But even in your poverty you do not shake off the ascetic Gotama! The ascetics are in and out of your house this very day just the same! What they have had of you cannot be recovered. That may be taken for certain. But henceforth don&rsquo;t you go yourself to the ascetic Gotama and don&rsquo;t let his disciples set foot inside your house. Do not even turn to look at the ascetic Gotama but attend to your trade and traffic in order to restore the family estate.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then he said to her, &ldquo;Was this the counsel you wanted to give me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it was.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7443"></a><a id="a7444"></a><span class="t34">Said the merchant, &ldquo;The One with Ten Powers has made me proof against a hundred, a thousand, yes against a hundred thousand Devatās such as you are! My faith is strong and steadfast as Mount Sineru! My substance has been expended on the dispensation that leads to safety. Wicked are your words; it is a blow aimed at the dispensation of the Buddhas by you, you wicked and impudent wretch. I cannot live under the same roof with you; be off at once from my house and seek shelter elsewhere!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7445"></a><span class="t34">Hearing these words of that converted man and elect disciple, she could not stay, but repairing to her dwelling, took her children by the hand and went forth. But though she went, she was minded, if she could not find herself a lodging elsewhere, to appease the merchant and return to dwell in his house; and in this mind she went to the tutelary deity of the city and with due salutation stood before him. Being asked what had brought her there, she said: &ldquo;My lord, I have been speaking imprudently to Anāthapiṇḍika, and he in his anger has turned me out of my home. Take me to him and make it up between us, so that he may let me live there again.&rdquo; &ldquo;But what was it you said to the merchant?&rdquo; &ldquo;I told him for the future not to support the Buddha and the Saṅgha, and not to let the ascetic Gotama set foot again in his house. This is what I said, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wicked were your words; it was a blow aimed at the dispensation. I cannot take you with me to the merchant.&rdquo; Meeting with no support from him, she went to the Four Great Kings of the world. And being repulsed by them in the same manner, she went on to Sakka, King of Devas, and told him her story, beseeching him still more earnestly, as follows, &ldquo;Deva, finding no shelter, I wander about homeless, leading my children by the hand. Grant me of your majesty some place wherein to dwell.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7446"></a><span class="t34">And he too said to her, &ldquo;You have done wickedly; it was a blow aimed at the Conqueror&rsquo;s dispensation. I cannot speak to the merchant on your behalf. But I can tell you one way whereby the merchant may be led to pardon you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pray tell me, Deva.&rdquo; &ldquo;Men have had eighteen crores of the merchant on bonds. Take the semblance of his agent, and without telling anybody repair to their houses with the bonds, in the company of some young Yakkhas. Stand in the middle of their houses with the bond in one hand and a receipt in the other, and terrify them with your Yakkha power, saying, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your acknowledgment of the debt. Our merchant did not move in the matter while he was affluent; but now he is poor, and you must pay up the money you owe.&rsquo; By your Yakkha power obtain all those eighteen crores of gold and fill the merchant&rsquo;s empty treasuries. He had another treasure buried in the banks of the river Aciravatī, but when the bank was washed away, the treasure was swept into the sea. Get that back also by your supernatural power and store it in his treasuries. Further, there is another sum of eighteen crores lying unowned in such and such a place. Bring that too and pour the money into his empty treasuries. When you have atoned by the recovery of these fifty-four crores, ask the merchant to forgive you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good, Deva,&rdquo; said she. And she set to work obediently, and did just as she had been bidden. When she had recovered all the money, she went into the merchant&rsquo;s chamber at dead of night and appeared before him in visible shape standing in the air.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The merchant asking who was there, she replied, &ldquo;It is I, great merchant, the blind and foolish Devatā who lived over your fourth gateway. In the greatness of my infatuate folly I knew not the virtues of a Buddha, and so came to say what I said to you some days ago. Pardon me my fault! At the instance of Sakka, King of Devas, I have made atonement by recovering the eighteen crores owing to you, the eighteen crores which had been washed down into the sea, and another eighteen crores which were lying unowned in such and such a place &ndash; making fifty-four crores in all, which I have poured into your empty treasure-chambers. The sum you expended on the monastery at Jetavana is now made up again. While I have nowhere to dwell, I am in misery. Bear not in mind what I did in my ignorant folly, great merchant, but pardon me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">As before, the heretical spirit that lived in the gate tower of Anāthapiṇḍika&rsquo;s house, doing penance, brought four and fifty crores of gold and filled the store-rooms, and became a friend of the great man. He led her before the Teacher. The Teacher discoursed to her. She heard, and entered on the First Path. Thenceforward the great man&rsquo;s honour was great as before.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now there was living in Sāvatthi a brahmin, versed in lucky marks, who thought on this wise. &ldquo;Anāthapiṇḍika was poor, and then became famous. What if I make as though I went to see him, and steal his luck?&rdquo; So to the house he went, and was welcomed hospitably. After exchanging civilities, the host asked why he had come. The brahmin was looking about to see where the man&rsquo;s luck lay. Now Anāthapiṇḍika had a white chicken, white as a scoured shell, which he kept in a golden cage, and in the comb of this chicken lay the great man&rsquo;s luck. The brahmin looked about and spied where the luck lay. &ldquo;Noble sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I teach magic charms to five hundred young fellows. We are plagued by a chicken that crows at the wrong time. Your chicken crows at the right time. For him I have come; will you give him to me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other: and at the instant the word was uttered, the hick left the cockscomb, and settled in a jewel put away in the pillow. The brahmin observed that the luck had gone into this jewel, and asked for it too. As soon as the owner agreed to give it, the luck left the jewel, and settled in a club for self-defence which lay upon the pillow. The brahmin saw it and asked again. &ldquo;Take it, and take your leave,&rdquo; said the owner; and in an instant the luck left the club, and settled on the head of the owner&rsquo;s chief wife, who was named the lady Puññalakkhaṇā. The thievish brahmin thought, when he saw this, &ldquo;This is an inalienable article which I cannot ask for.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then he told the great man, &ldquo;Noble sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I came to your house to steal your luck. The luck was in the comb of your </span><span class="t18">[2.280] </span><span class="t30">chicken. But when you gave me the chicken, the luck passed into this jewel; when you gave me the jewel it passed into your stick; when you gave the stick to me, it went out of it </span><span class="t18">{2.411}</span><span class="t30"> and passed into the head of the lady Puññalakkhaṇā. Surely this is inalienable, I can never get it. It is impossible to steal your luck &ndash; keep it, then!&rdquo; and rising from his seat, he departed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7447"></a><span class="t30">Anāthapiṇḍika determined to tell the Tathāgata; so he came to the monastery, and after respectfully greeting him, sat on one side, and told the Buddha all about it. The Teacher listened, and said: &ldquo;Householder, now-a-days the luck of one man does not go to another. But formerly the luck belonging to those of small wit went to the wise,&rdquo; and he told him a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a brahmin family in the realm of Kāsi. On growing up, he was educated at Taxila, and lived among his family; but when his parents died, much distressed he retired to the life of a recluse in the Himālayas, and there he cultivated the Super Knowledges and Attainments.</p>
<p class="p7">A long time passed, and he came down to inhabited parts for salt and savouring, and took up his quarters in the gardens of the king of Benares. Next day, on his begging rounds, he came to the door of an elephant-trainer. This man took a fancy to his ways and manners, fed him, and gave him lodging in his own grounds, waiting upon him continually.</p>
<p class="p7">Now it happened just then that a man whose business it was to gather firewood failed to get back to town from the woods in time. He lay down for the night in a temple, placing a bundle of sticks under his head for a pillow. At this temple there were a number of chickens quite free, which had perched close by on a tree. Towards morning, one of them, who was roosting high, let fall a dropping on the back of a bird below. &ldquo;Who dropped that on me?&rdquo; cried this one. &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; cried the first. &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said the other; and then did it again. Hereupon they both began to abuse each other, crying, &ldquo;What power have you? what power have you<span class="t11">?</span>&rdquo; At last the lower one said: &ldquo;Anybody who kills me, and eats my flesh roasted on the coals, <span class="t18">{2.412}</span> gets a thousand pieces of money in the morning!&rdquo; And the one above answered, &ldquo;Pooh, pooh, don&rsquo;t boast about a little thing like that! Anybody who eats my fleshy parts will become king; if he eats my outside, he&rsquo;ll become commander-in-chief or chief queen, according as he&rsquo;s man or woman; if he eats the flesh by my bones, he&rsquo;ll get the post of Royal Treasurer, if he be a householder; or, if a holy man, will become the king&rsquo;s favourite!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The stick-picker heard all this, and pondered. &ldquo;Now if I become king, there&rsquo;ll be no need of a thousand pieces of money.&rdquo; Quietly he climbed the tree, caught the topmost chicken and killed him: he fastened <span class="t18">[2.281] </span>him in a fold of his dress, saying to himself, &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll be king!&rdquo; As soon as the gates were opened, in he walked. He plucked the fowl, and cleaned it, and gave it to his wife, bidding her make the meat nice for eating. She got ready the meat with some rice, and set it before him, bidding her lord eat.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Good wife,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s great virtue in this meat. By eating it I shall become king, and you my queen!&rdquo; So they took the meat and rice down to the Ganges bank, intending to bathe before eating it. Then, putting meat and rice down upon the bank, in they went to bathe.</p>
<p class="p7">Just then a breeze stirred up the water, which washed away the meat. Down the river it floated, till it came in sight of an elephant-trainer, a great personage, who was giving his elephants a bath lower down. &ldquo;What have we here?&rdquo; said he, and picked it up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fowl and rice, my lord,&rdquo; was the reply. He bade wrap it up, and seal it, and sent it home to his wife, with a message to open it for him when he returned.</p>
<p class="p7">The stick-picker also ran off, with his belly puffed out with sand and water which he had swallowed.</p>
<p class="p7">Now a certain ascetic, who had divine vision, the favourite family priest of the elephant-trainer, was thinking to himself, &ldquo;My patron friend does not leave his post with the elephants. When will he attain promotion?&rdquo; As he thus pondered, he saw this man by his divine eye, and perceived what was doing. He went on before, and sat in the patron&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p class="p7">When the master returned, <span class="t18">{2.413}</span> he greeted him respectfully and sat down on one side. Then, sending for the parcel, he ordered food and water to be brought for the ascetic. The ascetic did not accept the food which was offered him; but said: &ldquo;I will divide this food.&rdquo; The master gave him leave. Then separating the meat into portions, he gave to the elephant-trainer the fleshy parts, the outside to his wife, and took the flesh about the bones for his own share. After the meal was over, he said: &ldquo;On the third day from this you will become king. Take care what you do!&rdquo; and away he went.</p>
<p class="p7">On the third day a neighbouring king came and beleaguered Benares. The king told his elephant-trainer to dress in the royal robes, bidding him go mount his elephant and fight. He himself put on a disguise, and mingled with the ranks; swift came an arrow, and pierced him, so that he perished then and there. The trainer, learning that the king was dead, sent for a great quantity of money, and beat the drum, proclaiming, &ldquo;Let those who want money, advance, and fight!&rdquo; The warrior host in a twinkling slew the hostile king.</p>
<p class="p7">After the king&rsquo;s obsequies the courtiers deliberated who was to be <span class="t18">[2.282] </span>made king. They said: &ldquo;While our king was yet alive, he put his royal robes upon the elephant-trainer. This very man has fought and won the kingdom. To him the kingdom shall be given!&rdquo; And they consecrated him king, and his wife they made the chief queen. The Bodhisatta became his confidant.</p>
<p class="p7">After this discourse the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, gave utterance to the two verses following:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7448"></a><a id="a7449"></a><span class="t12">1. Yaṁ ussukā saṅgharanti alakkhikā bahuṁ dhanaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a7456"></a><a id="a7457"></a><span class="t4">Whoever zealously gathers a lot of wealth, without fortune, those with skill, those without skill, having good luck, can enjoy that wealth.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7458"></a><a id="a7459"></a><a id="a7460"></a><a id="a7461"></a><span class="t12">2. Sabbattha katapuññassa aticcañ-ñeva pāṇino,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a7470"></a><a id="a7471"></a><a id="a7472"></a><span class="t4">Everywhere to the one who made merit, overcoming beings, a lot of wealth will arise, even without making exertion.</span><a id="a7473"></a><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t47">{2.414}</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a7474"></a>After this the Teacher added, &ldquo;Good air, these beings have no other resource but their merit won in previous births; this enables you to obtain treasures in places where there is no mine.&rdquo; Then he recited the following discourse.<a id="a7475"></a><a href="notes.html#a15369"><span class="t9">{539}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ldquo;There is a treasury of all good things</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which both to gods and men their wishes brings.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fine looks, voice, figure, form, and sovereignty</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With all its pomp, lies in that treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lordship and government, imperial bliss,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The crown of heaven, within that treasure is.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All human happiness, the joys of heaven,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nibbāna&rsquo;s self, from out that store is given.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">True ties of friendship, wisdom&rsquo;s liberty,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Firm self-control, lies in that treasury.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Emancipation, understanding, training fit</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To make Paccekabuddhas come from it.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus hath this merit a virtue magical;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The wise and steadfast praise it one and all.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{2.415}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Lastly the fowl repeated the third verse, explaining the treasures in which lay the luck of Anāthapiṇḍika,</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7476"></a><a id="a7477"></a><a id="a7478"></a><a id="a7479"></a><a id="a7480"></a><a id="a7481"></a><span class="t12">3. Kukkuṭo maṇayo daṇḍo thiyo ca puññalakkhaṇā,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><span class="t4">A chicken, jewels, a staff, and women are all signs of merit, they arise for the person, without wickedness, who made merit.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">Then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Elder Ānanda was the king, and the family priest was the Supreme Buddha.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h3 class="h30"><a id="ncx10507"></a><a id="a7482"></a><a id="a7483"></a><a id="a7484"></a><a id="a7485"></a><a id="a7486"></a><a id="a7487"></a><a id="a7488"></a>Ja 285 Maṇisūkarajātaka<br/>The Story about the Jewel and the Pigs (3s)</h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the outside sects are struggling and try to sully the reputation of the Buddha and the Saṅgha by staging a murder and blaming it on them, before being found out, and reduced to even lower standing. The Buddha tells a story of boars who tried to sully a jewel, only to make it shine forth stronger.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the ascetic (tāpasa).</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Present Compare: Dhp-a XXII.1 Sundarīparibbājikā.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a7489"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Slander, Blame, Animals.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;To hell shall go he.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.283]</span><a id="a7490"></a><a id="a7491"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about the murder of Sundarī. At that time we learn that the Bodhisatta was honoured and respected. The circumstances were the same as in the Kandhaka;</span><a id="a7492"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15371"><span class="t9">{540}</span></a><span class="t30"> this is an abstract of them. The Saṅgha of the Fortunate One had received gain and honour like five rivers pouring in a mighty flood; the heretics, finding that gain and honour came to them no longer, becoming dim like fireflies at sunrise, they collected together, and took counsel, &ldquo;Ever since the ascetic Gotama appeared, our gain and glory has gone from us. Not a soul ever knows that we exist. Who will help us to bring reproach on Gotama, and prevent him from getting all this?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then an idea occurred to them. &ldquo;Sundarī will make us able to do it.&rdquo; So when one day Sundarī visited the heretics&rsquo; grove, they gave her greeting, but said nothing more. She addressed them again and again, but received no answer. &ldquo;Has anything annoyed the holy fathers?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why, sister,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;do not you see how the ascetic Gotama annoys us, depriving us of alms and honour?&rdquo; &ldquo;What can I do about it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You, sister, are fair and lovely. You can bring disgrace upon Gotama, and your words will influence a great many, </span><span class="t18">{2.416}</span><span class="t30"> and you can thus restore our gains and good repute.&rdquo; She agreed, and took her leave.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7493"></a><a id="a7494"></a><a id="a7495"></a><span class="t30">After this she used to take flowers and scents and perfumes, camphor, condiments and fruits, and at evening time, when a great crowd had entered the city after hearing the Teacher&rsquo;s discourse, she would set her face towards Jetavana. If any asked where she was going, she would say, &ldquo;To the ascetic Gotama; I live with him in one perfumed chamber.&rdquo; Then she spent the night in a heretical settlement, and in the morning entered the road which led from Jetavana into the city. If any asked her where she was going, she replied, &ldquo;I have been with the ascetic Gotama in one perfumed chamber, and he made love to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lapse of some days they hired some ruffians to kill Sundarī before Gotama&rsquo;s chamber and throw her body into the dust-heap. And so they did. Then the heretics made a hue and cry after Sundarī, and informed the king. He asked where their suspicions pointed. They answered that she had gone the last few days to Jetavana, but what happened afterwards they did not know. He sent them to search for her. Acting on this permission, they took his own servants, and went to Jetavana, where they hunted about till they found her in the dust-heap. Calling for a litter, they brought the body into the town, and told the king that the disciples of Gotama had killed Sundarī, and thrown her in the dust-heap, in order to cloak the wrong of their teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The king bade them scour the city. All through the streets they went, crying, &ldquo;Come and see what has been done by the monastics of the Sakya prince!&rdquo; and came back to the palace door. The king had placed the body of Sundarī upon a platform, and had it watched in the cemetery. All the populace, except the holy disciples, went about inside the town, outside the town, in the parks and in the woods, abusing the monks, and crying out, &ldquo;Come and see what the monastics of the Sakya prince have done!&rdquo; The monks told all this to the Tathāgata. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Well, go and reprove these people in these words: </span><span class="t18">[2.284]</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&ldquo;To hell shall go he that delights in lies,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">And he who having done a thing, denies: </span><span class="t18">{2.417}</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Both these, when death has carried them away,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><a id="a7496"></a><span class="t31">As men of evil deeds elsewhere shall rise.&rdquo;</span><a id="a7497"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15373"><span class="t32">{541}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">The king directed some men to find out whether Sundarī had been killed by anybody else. Now the ruffians had drunk the blood-money, and were quarrelling together. Said one to another, &ldquo;You killed Sundarī with one blow, and then threw her in the dust-heap, and here you are, buying liquor with the blood-money!&rdquo; &ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; said the king&rsquo;s messengers; and they caught the ruffians and dragged them before the king. &ldquo;Did you kill her?&rdquo; asked the king. They said: &ldquo;Yes, they did.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who bade you?&rdquo; &ldquo;The heretics, my lord.&rdquo; The king had the heretics summoned. &ldquo;Lift up Sundarī,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and carry her round the city, crying as you go: &lsquo;This woman Sundarī wanted to bring disgrace upon the ascetic Gotama; we had her murdered; the guilt is not Gotama&rsquo;s, nor his disciples;&rsquo; the guilt is ours!&rsquo; &rdquo; They did so.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">A multitude of the unconverted believed, and the heretics were kept out of mischief by receiving the punishment for murder. Thenceforward the Buddha&rsquo;s reputation grew greater and greater.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">And then one day they began to gossip in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Friend, the heretics thought to blacken the Buddha, and they only blackened themselves: ever since, our gains and glory have increased!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking about? They told him. &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is impossible to make the Buddha impure. Trying to stain the Buddha, is like trying to stain a gem of the greatest brilliance. In bygone ages people have wished to stain a fine jewel, and no matter how they tried, they failed to do it.&rdquo; And he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a brahmin family. When he grew up, perceiving the suffering that arises from desire, he went away, and traversed three ranges of the Himālayas, where he became an ascetic, and lived in a hut of leaves.</p>
<p class="p7">Near his hut was a crystal cave, in which lived thirty boars. Near the cave a lion used to range. <span class="t18">{2.418}</span> His shadow used to be reflected in the crystal. The boars used to see this reflection, and terror made them lean and thin-blooded. Thought they, &ldquo;We see the reflection because this crystal is clear. We will make it dirty and discolour it.&rdquo; So they got some mud from a pool close by, and rubbed and rubbed the crystal with it. But the crystal, being constantly polished by the boars&rsquo; bristles, got brighter than ever.</p>
<p class="p7">They did not know how to manage it; so they determined to ask the ascetic how they might sully the crystal. To him therefore they came, and after respectful greeting, they sat down beside him, and gave utterance to these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7498"></a><a id="a7499"></a><a id="a7500"></a><span class="t12">1. Dariyā satta vassāni tiṁsamattā vasāmase,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7501"></a><a id="a7502"></a><span class="t12">Haññāma maṇino ābhaṁ, iti no mantaraṁ ahu.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a7503"></a><a id="a7504"></a><span class="t4">Inside the cave for seven years at least thirty of us do dwell, we will destroy the crystal light, thus for us there was a wise one.</span><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t47">[2.285]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7505"></a><a id="a7506"></a><a id="a7507"></a><a id="a7508"></a><a id="a7509"></a><span class="t12">2. Yāvatā maṇiṁ ghaṁsāma bhiyyo vodāyate maṇi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7510"></a><span class="t12">Idañ-cadāni pucchāma: kiṁ kiccaṁ idha maññasī ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a7511"></a><a id="a7512"></a><span class="t4">In whatever way we rub the crystal it becomes more clear, now we ask you about this: what do you think ought to be done here?</span></p>
<p class="p23">The Bodhisatta listened, then he repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7513"></a><a id="a7514"></a><a id="a7515"></a><a id="a7516"></a><a id="a7517"></a><span class="t12">3. Ayaṁ maṇi veḷuriyo akāco vimalo subho,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7518"></a><span class="t12">Nāssa sakkā siriṁ hantuṁ, apakkamatha sūkarā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a7519"></a><a id="a7520"></a><a id="a7521"></a><span class="t4">This precious crystal, that is flawless, unblemished and brilliant, nothing is able to destroy its light, O boars, you must depart.</span></p>
<p class="p23">And so they did, on hearing this answer. The Bodhisatta lost himself in Absorption, and became destined to the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time, I was the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>

The circumstances will be explained in the Cullanāradakassapa [Ja 477] story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about the allurements of a sensual girl.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7534"></a><span class="t34">There was then, we learn, a girl of about sixteen, daughter of a citizen of Sāvatthi, such as might bring good luck to a man, yet no man chose her. So her mother thought to herself, &ldquo;This my daughter is of full age, yet no one chooses her. I will use her as bait for a fish, and make one of those Sākiyan ascetics come back to the world, and live upon him.&rdquo; At the time there was a young man of good birth living in Sāvatthi, who had given his heart to the dispensation and went forth. But from the time when he had received full ordination he had lost all desire for learning, and lived devoted to the adornment of his</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t34">person.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The lay sister used to prepare in her house rice gruel, and other food hard or soft, and standing at the door, as the monks walked along the streets, looked out for someone who could be tempted by the craving for delicacies. Streaming by went a crowd of monks who upheld the Three Baskets, including the Abhidhamma and the Vinaya; but among them she saw none ready to rise to her bait. Among the figures with bowl and robe, preachers of the Dhamma with honey-sweet voice, moving like fleecy scud before the wind, she saw not one.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But at last she perceived a man approaching, the outer corners of his eyes anointed, hair hanging down, wearing an under-robe of fine cloth, and an outer robe shaken and cleansed, bearing a bowl coloured like some precious gem, and a sunshade after his own heart, a man who let his senses have their own way, his body much bronzed. &ldquo;Here is a man I can catch!&rdquo; thought she; and greeting him, she took his bowl, and invited him into the house. She found him a seat, and provided rice gruel and all the rest; then after the meal, begged him to make that house his resort in future. So he used to visit the house after that, and in course of time became intimate.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">One day, the lay sister said in his hearing, &ldquo;In this household we are happy enough, only I have no son or son-in-law capable of keeping it up.&rdquo; The man heard it, and wondering what reason she could have for so saying, in a little while he was as it were pierced to the heart. She said to her daughter, &ldquo;Tempt this man, and get him into your power.&rdquo; So the girl after that time decked herself and adorned herself, and tempted him with all women&rsquo;s tricks and wiles. Then the man, being young and under the power of passion, thought in his heart, &ldquo;I cannot now hold on to the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation,&rdquo; and he went to the monastery, and laying down bowl and robe, said to his spiritual teachers, &ldquo;I am discontented.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then they conducted him to the Teacher, and said: &ldquo;Sir, this monk is discontented.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So the Teacher asked this monk whether it was true he had fallen in love. Yes, he said. &ldquo;With whom?&rdquo; the Teacher asked. &ldquo;With a sensual girl.&rdquo; &ldquo;That woman, monk,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;is your bane; long ago, as now, you became food for the crowd through your desire to marry her.&rdquo; Then at the request of the monks he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7535"></a><a id="a7536"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta was an ox named Mahālohita [Big Red], and he had a young brother called Cullalohita [Little Red]. Both of them worked for a family in some village. <span class="t18">[2.286]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7537"></a>There was in this family a grown-up girl, who was asked in marriage by another family. Now in the first family a pig called Sālūka [Celery],<a id="a7538"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15377"><span class="t9">{543}</span></a><a id="a7539"></a> was being fattened, on purpose to serve for a feast on the wedding-day; it used to sleep in a sty.<a id="a7540"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15379"><span class="t9">{544}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">One day, Cullalohita said to his brother, &ldquo;Brother, we work for this family, and we help them to get their living. Yet they only give us grass and straw, while they feed that pig with rice porridge, and let it sleep in a sty; and what can it do for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Big Redcoat, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t covet his porridge. They want to make a feast of him on our young lady&rsquo;s wedding-day, that&rsquo;s why they are fattening him up. Wait a few days, and you&rsquo;ll see him dragged out of his sty, killed, chopped into bits, and eaten up by the visitors.&rdquo; So saying, he composed the first two verses: <span class="t18">{2.420}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7541"></a><a id="a7542"></a><span class="t12">1. Mā Sālūkassa pihayi, āturannāni bhuñjati,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a7544"></a><a id="a7545"></a><a id="a7546"></a><span class="t4">Do not envy Sālūka, he eats food ending in misery, being unconcerned eat your chaff, that is the mark of a long life.</span></p>

<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Now, after coming here, strangers together with their attendant will see Sālūka lying down and with his grinder facing up.</span></p>
<p class="p23">A few days after, the wedding guests came, and Sālūka was killed and made a meal of. Both oxen, seeing what became of him, thought their own chaff was the best.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, after Fully Awakening, repeated the third verse by way of explanation:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7557"></a><a id="a7558"></a><span class="t12">3. Vikantaṁ sūkaraṁ disvā sayantaṁ musaluttaraṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a7564"></a><span class="t4">Seeing the pig lying all cut up with his grinder facing up, the old bulls did think: &lsquo;Our chaff is comparatively excellent.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had finished this discourse, he declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths, the monk in question attained the fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time, the sensual girl was the same, the lovesick monk was Sālūka, Ānanda was Cullalohita, and I was Mahālohita myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a7570"></a><span class="t15">In the present one monk speaks against the qualities one has to develop in order to get material gains. The Buddha remarks that this is not the first time he spoke like this, he did so also in a previous life.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a7571"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Gains, Bad behaviour.</span></p>

The elder replied, &ldquo;Friend, there are four qualities which make a man successful in getting gains. He must get rid of modesty from his heart, must resign his orders, must seem to be mad even if he is not; he must speak slander; he must behave like a dancer; he must use unkind words everywhere.&rdquo; Thus he explained how a man gets great gains. The monk objected to this method, and went away. The elder went to his Teacher, and told him about it. The Teacher said: &ldquo;This is not the first time that this monk spoke in dispraise of gains; he did the same before,&rdquo; and then, at the request of the elder, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family. When he grew up to the age of sixteen years, he had already mastered the three Vedas and the eighteen accomplishments; and he became a far-famed teacher, who educated a body of five hundred young men. One young man, a youth of virtuous life, approached his teacher one day with the question, &ldquo;How is it these people get gains?</p>
<p class="p7">The teacher answered, &ldquo;My son, there are four qualities which procure gains for those people,&rdquo; and he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7573"></a><span class="t12">1. Nānummatto nāpisuṇo nānaṭo nākutūhalo,</span></p>

<p class="p23">The pupil, on hearing his master&rsquo;s words, expressed his disapproval of gain-getting in the two following verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7583"></a><a id="a7584"></a><span class="t12">2. Dhi-r-atthu taṁ yasalābhaṁ dhanalābhañ-ca brāhmaṇa,</span></p>

<p class="p23"><a id="a7599"></a><a id="a7600"></a><a id="a7601"></a>Thus did the youth praise the quality of the ascetic life; and straight became an ascetic, and craved alms with righteousness, cultivating the Attainments, until he became destined to the Brahmā Realm.</p>

The circumstances have been told above.</span><a id="a7609"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15381"><span class="t9">{545}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7610"></a><span class="t34">This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a cheating merchant. There were two merchants in partnership at Sāvatthi, we are told, who travelled with their merchandise and came back with the proceeds. And the cheating merchant thought to himself, &ldquo;My partner has been badly fed and badly lodged for so many days past that he will die of indigestion now he has got home again and can feast to his heart&rsquo;s content on dainties manifold. My plan is to divide what we have made into three portions, giving one to his orphans and keeping two for myself.&rdquo; And with this object he made some excuse day by day for putting off the division of the profits.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Finding that it was in vain to press for a division, the honest partner went to the Teacher at the monastery, made his salutation, and was received kindly. &ldquo;It is a very long time,&rdquo; said the Buddha, &ldquo;since you came last to see me.&rdquo; And hereupon the merchant told the Teacher what had befallen him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;This is not the first time, lay-follower,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;that this man has been a cheating merchant; he was no less a cheat in times past. As he tries to defraud you now, so did he try to defraud the wise and good of other days.&rdquo; So saying, at the merchant&rsquo;s request, the Teacher told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in the family of a landed proprietor.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7611"></a>When he grew up, he became a wealthy man. He had a young brother. Afterwards their father died. They determined to arrange some business of their father&rsquo;s. This took them to a village, where they were paid a thousand pieces of money. On their way back, as they waited on a riverbank for the boat, they ate a meal out of a leaf-basket. The Bodhisatta threw what he left into the Ganges for the fishes, giving the merit to the river Devatā. The Devatā accepted this with gratification, which increased her divine power, and on thinking over this increase of her power, became aware what had happened. The Bodhisatta <span class="t18">{2.424}</span> laid his upper garment upon the sand, and there he lay down and went to sleep.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7612"></a>Now the young brother was of a rather thievish nature. He wanted to filch the money from the Bodhisatta and keep it himself; so he packed a parcel of gravel to look like the parcel of money, and put them both away.</p>
<p class="p7">When they had got aboard, and were come to mid-river, the younger brother stumbled against the side of the boat, and dropped overboard the parcel of gravel, as he thought, but really the money.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Brother, the money&rsquo;s overboard!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; &ldquo;What can we do? What&rsquo;s gone is gone. Never mind about it,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<p class="p7">But the river Devatā thought how pleased she had been with the merit she had received, and how her divine power had been increased, and resolved to take care of his property. So by her power she made a big-mouthed fish swallow the parcel, and took care of it herself.</p>
<p class="p7">When the thief got home, he chuckled over the trick he had served his brother, and undid the remaining parcel. There was nothing but gravel to be seen! His heart dried up; he fell on his bed, and clutched the bedstead. <span class="t18">[2.289]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now some fishermen just then cast their nets for a draught. By power of the river Devatā, this fish fell into the net. The fishermen took it to town to sell. People asked what the price was.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;A thousand pieces and seven annas,&rdquo; said the fishermen. Everybody made fun of them. &ldquo;We have seen a fish offered for a thousand pieces!&rdquo; they laughed.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7613"></a>The fishermen brought their fish to the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s door, and asked him to buy it. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the price?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You may have it for seven annas,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7614"></a>&ldquo;What did you ask other people for it?&rdquo; &ldquo;From other people we asked a thousand rupees and seven annas; but you may have it for seven annas,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p class="p7">He paid seven annas for it, and sent it to his wife. She cut it open, and there was the parcel of money! <span class="t18">{2.425}</span> She called the Bodhisatta. He gave a look, and recognising his mark, knew it for his own. He thought: &ldquo;These fishermen asked other people the price of a thousand rupees and seven annas, but because the thousand rupees were mine, they let me have it for seven annas only! If a man does not understand the meaning of this, nothing will ever make him believe,&rdquo; and then he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7615"></a><span class="t12">1. Agghanti macchā adhikaṁ sahassaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7616"></a><span class="t12">Na atthi so yo imaṁ saddaheyya!</span></p>

<p class="p23">When he had said this, he wondered how it was that he had recovered his money.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7623"></a>At the moment the river Devatā hovered invisibly in the air, and declared: &ldquo;I am the spirit of the Ganges. You gave the remains of your meal to the fishes, and let me have the merit. Therefore I have taken care of your property,&rdquo; and she repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7624"></a><span class="t12">2. Macchānaṁ bhojanaṁ datvā, mama dakkhiṇam-ādisi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7625"></a><a id="a7626"></a><span class="t12">Taṁ dakkhiṇaṁ sarantiyā, kataṁ apacitiṁ tayā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a7627"></a><a id="a7628"></a><a id="a7629"></a><span class="t4">Having given food to the fish, to me you gave an offering, through remembering this offering, that respect was paid by you.</span><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t47">{2.426}</span></p>
<p class="p23">Then the Devatā told about the mean trick which the younger brother had played. Then she added, &ldquo;There he lies, with his heart dried up within him. There is no prosperity for the cheat. But I have brought you your own, and I warn you not to lose it. Don&rsquo;t give it to your young thief of a brother, but keep it all yourself.&rdquo; Then she repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7630"></a><a id="a7631"></a><span class="t12">3. Paduṭṭhacittassa na phāti hoti,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7632"></a><span class="t12">Na cāpi taṁ Devatā pūjayanti,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7633"></a><a id="a7634"></a><span class="t12">Yo bhātaraṁ pettikaṁ sāpateyyaṁ</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7635"></a><a id="a7636"></a><span class="t12">Avañcayī dukkaṭakammakārī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a7637"></a><a id="a7638"></a><span class="t4">There is no growth for one corrupt at heart, also Devatās do not respect him, he who cheats his brother of paternal property is one who performs wrong deeds.</span><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t47">[2.290]</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus spoke the spirit, not wishing that the treacherous villain should receive the money. But the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; and all the same sent the brother five hundred.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After this discourse, the Teacher declared the Truths: at the conclusion of which the merchant entered upon the fruition of the First Path, and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the younger brother was the dishonest merchant, but the elder was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
