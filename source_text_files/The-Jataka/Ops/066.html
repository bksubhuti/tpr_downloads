<p class="p7"><a id="a9724"></a><span class="t15">In the present one man supports his mother, and when his wife wants to expel her, he refuses to. The Buddha tells an opposite story in which the son does expel the mother, and the latter holds funeral prayers for Dhamma, which had died. Sakka, stirred by her prayer, ensures her son returns, apologizes and takes up his duties again.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (the King of the Devas) Sakka,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the one who supported his mother = the same in the past (mātuposaka),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">his wife = the same in the past (bhariyā).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Robed in white.&rdquo;</span><span class="t34"> </span><span class="t18">[3.253] {3.422}</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this tale while dwelling at Jetavana, concerning a man who supported his mother. The story is that the man was of good family and conduct in Sāvatthi, on his father&rsquo;s death he became devoted to his mother and tended her with the services of mouth-washing, teeth-cleansing, bathing, feet-washing and the like, and also by giving her gruel, rice and other food. She said to him, &ldquo;Dear son, there are other duties in a householder&rsquo;s life, you must marry a maid of a suitable family, who will attend to me, and then you can do your proper work.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother, it is for my own good and pleasure that I wait on you, who else would wait on you so well?&rdquo; &ldquo;Son, you ought to do something to advance the fortune of our house.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have no care for a householder&rsquo;s life; I will wait on you, and after you are dead and burned I will become an ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">She pressed him again and again, and at last, without winning him over or gaining his consent, she brought him a maid of a suitable family. He married and lived with her, because he would not oppose his mother. She observed the great attention with which her husband waited on his mother, and desirous of imitating it she too waited on her with care. Noticing his wife&rsquo;s devotion, he gave her thenceforth all the pleasant food he could get. As time went on she foolishly thought in her pride, &ldquo;He gives me all the pleasant food he gets, he must be anxious to get rid </span><span class="t18">{3.423}</span><span class="t30"> of his mother and I will find some means for doing so.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So one day she said: &ldquo;Husband, your mother scolds me when you leave the house.&rdquo; He said nothing. She thought: &ldquo;I will irritate the old woman and make her disagreeable to her son,&rdquo; and thenceforth she gave her rice-gruel either very hot or very cold or very salt or saltless. When the old woman complained that it was too hot or too salt, she threw in cold water enough to fill the dish, and then on complaints of its being cold and saltless, she would make a great outcry, &ldquo;Just now you said it was too hot and too salt, who can satisfy you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So at the bath she would throw very hot water on the old woman&rsquo;s back, when she said: &ldquo;Daughter, my back is burning,&rdquo; the other would throw some very cold water on her, and on complaints of this, she would make a story to the neighbours, &ldquo;This woman said just now it was too hot, now she screams &lsquo;it is too cold,&rsquo; who can endure her impudence?&rdquo; If the old woman complained that her bed was full of fleas, she would take the bed out and shake her own bed over it and then bring it back declaring, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given it a shake,&rdquo; the good old lady, having twice as many fleas biting her </span><span class="t18">[3.254] </span><span class="t30">now, would spend the night sitting up and complain of being bitten all night; the other would retort, &ldquo;Your bed was shaken yesterday and the day before too, who can satisfy all such a woman&rsquo;s needs?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">To set the old woman&rsquo;s son against her, she would scatter phlegm and mucus and grey hairs here and there, and when he asked who was making the whole house so dirty, she would say, &ldquo;Your mother does it; but if she is told not to do so, she makes an outcry, I can&rsquo;t stay in the same house with such an old wretch; you must decide whether she stays or I.&rdquo; He hearkened to her and said: &ldquo;Wife, you are yet young and can get a living wherever you go, but my mother is weak and I am her stay, go and depart to your own kin.&rdquo; When she heard this, she was afraid and thought: &ldquo;He cannot break with his mother who is so very dear to him, but if I go to my old home, I shall have a miserable life of separation, I will conciliate my mother-in-law and tend her as of old,&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.424}</span><span class="t30"> and thenceforth she did so.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day that lay brother went to Jetavana to hear the Dhamma, saluting the Teacher he stood on one side. The Teacher asked him if he were not careless of his old duties, if he were dutiful in tending his mother. He answered, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, my mother brought me a maid to wife against my will, she did such and such unseemly things,&rdquo; telling him all, &ldquo;but the woman could not make me break with my mother, and now she tends her with all respect.&rdquo; The Teacher heard the story and said: &ldquo;This time you would not do her bidding, but formerly you cast out your mother at her bidding and owing to me took her back again to your house and tended her,&rdquo; and at the man&rsquo;s request he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, a young man of a certain family on his father&rsquo;s death devoted himself to his mother and tended her as in the introductory story, the details are to be given in full as above. But in this case, when his wife said she could not live with the old wretch and he must decide which of them should go, he took her word that his mother was in fault and said: &ldquo;Mother, you are always raising strife in the house, henceforth go and live in some other place, wherever you choose.&rdquo; She obeyed, weeping, and going to a certain friend&rsquo;s house, she worked for wages and with difficulty made a living. After she left, her daughter-in-law conceived a child, and went about saying to her husband and the neighbours that such a thing could never have happened as long as the old wretch was in the house. After the child was born, she said to her husband, &ldquo;I never had a son while your mother stayed in the house, but now I have, so you can see what a wretch she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The old woman heard that the son&rsquo;s birth was thought to be due to her leaving the house, and she thought: &ldquo;Surely Dhamma must be dead in the world, <span class="t18">{3.425}</span><a id="a9726"></a> if it were not so, these people would not have got a son and a comfortable life after beating and casting out their mother, I will make an offering for the dead Dhamma.&rdquo; So one day she took ground sesame and rice and a little pot and a spoon, she went to a cemetery of corpses and kindled a fire under an oven made with three human skulls, then she went down into the water, bathed herself head and all, washed her garment and coming back to her fireplace, she loosened her hair and began to wash the rice. <span class="t18">[3.255]</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta was at that time Sakka, king of heaven; and the Bodhisattas are vigilant. At the instant he saw, in his survey of the world, that the poor old woman was making a death-offering to Dhamma as if Dhamma were dead. Wishing to show his power in helping her, he came down disguised as a brahmin travelling on the high road, at sight of her he left the road and standing near her, began a conversation by saying: &ldquo;Mother, people do not cook food in cemeteries, what are you going to do with this sesame and rice when cooked?&rdquo; So he spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Robed in white, with dripping hair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9727"></a><span class="t12">Why, Kaccāni,</span><a id="a9728"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15673"><span class="t19">{684}</span></a><span class="t12"> boil the pot?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Washing rice and sesame there,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Will you use them when they&rsquo;re hot?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">She spoke the second verse to give him information,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Brahmin, not for food will I</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Use the sesame and the rice,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dhamma&rsquo;s dead; its memory</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I would crown with sacrifice.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.426}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Lady, think ere you decide,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who has told you such a lie?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Strong in might and thousand-eyed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Perfect Dhamma cannot die.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing him, the woman spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Brahmin, I have witness strong,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dhamma&rsquo;s dead I must believe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All men now who follow wrong</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Great prosperity receive.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. Barren once, my good son&rsquo;s spouse</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beats me, and she bears a son,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She is lady of our house,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I an outcast and undone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka spoke the sixth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9729"></a><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Nay, I live eternally;</span><a id="a9730"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15675"><span class="t19">{685}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas for your sake that I came,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She beat you; but her son and she</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Shall be ashes in my flame.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.427}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing him, she cried, &ldquo;Alas, what say you? I will try to save my grandson from death,&rdquo; and so she spoke the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;King of gods, your will be done,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If for me you left the sky,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May my children and their son</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Live with me in amity.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.256]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka spoke the eighth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Kātiyāni&rsquo;s will be done,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beaten, you on Dhamma rely,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With your children and their son</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Share one home in amity.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After saying this, Sakka, now in all his divine apparel, stood in the air by his supernatural power and said: &ldquo;Kaccāni, be not afraid, by my power your son and daughter-in-law will come, and after getting your forgiveness on the way will take you back with them, dwell with them in peace,&rdquo; then he went to his own place. By Sakka&rsquo;s power they bethought themselves of her goodness, and making enquiry through the village they found she had gone towards the cemetery. They went along the road calling for her, when they saw her they fell at her feet, and asked and obtained her pardon for their offence. She welcomed her grandson. So they all went home in delight and thenceforth dwelt together.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;Joyful with her good son&rsquo;s wife</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kātiyāni then did dwell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sakka pacified their strife,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Son and grandson tend her well.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">This verse was spoken after Fully Awakening. <span class="t18">{3.428}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, after the Truths that lay brother was established in the fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time the man who supported his mother was the man who is supporting his mother today, the wife of that time was the wife of today, and Sakka was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the king of Kosala hears the cries during the night and is worried what they mean. His brahmins tell him that he needs to give a large animal sacrifice to ward of danger. The Buddha tells of a similar event in a past life, and how he had explained them to the king, and had all the animals released.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;A pool so deep.&rdquo;</span><a id="a9737"></a><a id="a9738"></a><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning an indistinguishable terrific sound heard at midnight by the king of Kosala. The occasion is like that already described in the Lohakumbhijātaka [Ja 314].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The king of Kosala of those days, they say, one night heard a cry uttered by four inhabitants of hell &ndash; the syllables du, sa, na, so, one from each of the four. In a previous existence, tradition says, they had been princes in Sāvatthi, and had been guilty of adultery. After misconducting themselves with their neighbours&rsquo; wives, however carefully guarded they might be, and indulging their amorous propensities, their evil life had been cut short by the Wheel of Death, near Sāvatthi. They came to life again in Four Iron Cauldrons. After being tortured for sixty thousand years they had come up to the top, and on seeing the edge of the Cauldron&rsquo;s mouth they thought to themselves, &ldquo;When shall we escape from this misery?&rdquo; And then all four uttered a loud cry, one after another. The king was terrified to death at the noise, and sat waiting for break of day, unable to stir.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At dawn the brahmins came and inquired after his health. The king replied, &ldquo;How, my masters, can I be well, who today have heard four such terrible cries.&rdquo; The brahmins waved their hands. &ldquo;What is it, my masters?&rdquo; said the king. The brahmins assure him that the sounds are ominous of great violence. &ldquo;Do they admit of remedy, or not?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;You might say not,&rdquo; said the brahmins, &ldquo;but we are well-trained in these matters, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;By what means,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;will you avert these evils?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;there is one great remedy in our power, and by offering the fourfold sacrifice of every living creature we will avert all evil.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then be quick,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;and take all living creatures by fours &ndash; men, bulls, horses, elephants, down to quails and other birds &ndash; and by this fourfold sacrifice restore my peace of mind.&rdquo; The brahmins consented, and taking whatever they required, they dug a sacrificial pit and fastened their numerous victims to their stakes, and were highly excited at the thought of the dainties they were to eat, and the wealth they would gain, and went about backwards and forwards, saying: &ldquo;Sir, I must have so and so.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The queen Mallikā came and asked the king, why the brahmins went about so delighted and smiling. The king said: &ldquo;My queen, what have you to do with this? You are intoxicated with your own glory, and you do not know how wretched I am.&rdquo; &ldquo;How so, sire?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I have heard such awful noises, my queen, and when I asked the brahmins what would be the result of my hearing these cries, they told me I was threatened with danger to my kingdom or my property or my life, but by offering the fourfold sacrifice they would restore my peace of mind, and now in obedience to my command, they have dug a sacrificial pit and are gone to fetch whatever victims they require.&rdquo; The queen said: &ldquo;Have you, my lord, consulted the chief brahmin in the Deva world as to the origin of these cries?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who, lady,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;is the chief brahmin in the Deva world?&rdquo; &ldquo;The Great Gotama,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;the Supreme Buddha.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I have not consulted the Supreme Buddha.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then go,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and consult him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The king hearkened to the words of the queen and after his morning meal he mounted his state chariot and drove to Jetavana. Here after saluting the Teacher he thus addressed him, &ldquo;Venerable sir, in the night season I heard four cries and consulted the brahmins about it. They undertook to restore my peace of mind, by the fourfold sacrifice of every kind of victim, and are now busy preparing a sacrificial pit.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At this time however, when the king said: &ldquo;Lord, what does the hearing of these sounds import to me?&rdquo; the Teacher answered, &ldquo;Great king, be not afraid, no danger shall befall you owing to these sounds, such terrible indistinguishable </span><span class="t18">[3.257] </span><span class="t30">sounds have not been heard by you alone, kings of old also heard like sounds, and meant to follow the advice of brahmins to offer in sacrifice four animals of each species, but after hearing what wise men had to say, they set free the animals collected for sacrifice and caused proclamation by drum against all slaughter,&rdquo; and at the king&rsquo;s request, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family worth eighty crores. When he grew up he learned the arts at Taxila. After his parents&rsquo; death he reviewed all their treasures, got rid of all his wealth by way of generosity, forsook desires, went to the Himālayas and became an ascetic and entered on the Absorptions and Super Knowledges. After a time he came to the haunts of men for salt and vinegar, and reaching Benares dwelt in a garden.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time the king of Benares when seated on his royal bed at midnight heard eight sounds, first, a crane made a noise in a garden near the palace; second, immediately after the crane, a female crow made a noise from the gateway of the elephant-house; <span class="t18">{3.429}</span><a id="a9739"></a> third, an insect settled on the peak of the palace made a noise; fourth, a tame cuckoo in the palace made a noise; fifth, a tame deer in the same place; sixth, a tame monkey there; seventh, a Kinnara living in the palace; eighth, immediately after the last, a Paccekabuddha, passing along the roof of the king&rsquo;s habitation to the garden, uttered an exalted utterance.</p>
<p class="p7">The king was terrified at hearing these eight sounds, and next day consulted the brahmins. The brahmins said: &ldquo;Great king, there is danger for you, let us offer sacrifice out of the palace,&rdquo; and getting his leave to do their pleasure, they came in joy and delight and began the work of sacrifice. Now a young pupil of the oldest sacrificial brahmin was wise and learned, he said to his master, &ldquo;Teacher, do not cause such a harsh and cruel slaughter of so many creatures.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pupil, what do you know about it? Even if nothing else happens, we shall get much fish and flesh to eat.&rdquo; &ldquo;Teacher, do not, for the belly&rsquo;s sake, an action which will cause rebirth in hell.&rdquo; Hearing this, the other brahmins were angry with the pupil for endangering their gains. The pupil in fear said: &ldquo;Very well, devise a means then of getting fish and flesh to eat,&rdquo; and left the city looking for some pious ascetic able to prevent the king from sacrificing.</p>
<p class="p7">He entered the royal garden and seeing the Bodhisatta, he saluted him and said: &ldquo;Have you no compassion for creatures? The king has ordered a sacrifice which will bring death on many creatures, ought you not to bring about the release of such a multitude?&rdquo; &ldquo;Young brahmin, I do not know the king of this land, nor he me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, do you know what will be the consequence of those sounds the king heard?&rdquo; &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you know, <span class="t18">{3.430}</span><a id="a9740"></a> why do you not tell the king?&rdquo; &ldquo;Young brahmin, how can I go with a horn fastened<a id="a9741"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15677"><span class="t9">{686}</span></a> on my <span class="t18">[3.258] </span>forehead and say, &lsquo;I know?&rsquo; If the king comes here to question me, I will tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The young brahmin went swiftly to the king&rsquo;s court, and when he was asked his business, he said: &ldquo;Great king, a certain ascetic knows the issue of those sounds you heard, he is sitting on the royal seat in your garden, and says he will tell you if you ask him, you should do so.&rdquo; The king went swiftly, saluted the ascetic, and after friendly greeting he sat down and asked, &ldquo;Is it true that you know the issue of the sounds I have heard?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, great king.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then pray tell me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Great king, there is no danger connected with those sounds, there is a certain crane in your old garden; it was without food, and half dead with hunger made the first sound,&rdquo; and so by his knowledge giving precisely the crane&rsquo;s meaning he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;A pool so deep and full of fish they called this place of yore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The crane-king&rsquo;s residence it was, my ancestors&rsquo; before,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And though we live on frogs today, we never leave its shore.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;That, great king, was the sound the crane made in the pangs of hunger, if you wish to set it free from hunger, have the garden cleaned and fill the tank with water.&rdquo; The king told a minister to have this done.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Great king, there is a female crow who lives in the doorway of your elephant house, she made the second sound, grieving for her son, you need have no fear from it,&rdquo; and so he uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Oh! Who of wicked Bandhura? The single eye will rend</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My nest, my nestlings and myself, oh! who will now befriend?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.431}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then he asked the king for the name of the chief groom in the elephant-house. &ldquo;His name, sir, is Bandhura.&rdquo; &ldquo;Has he only one eye, O king?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Great king, a certain crow has built her nest over the doorway of your elephant-house; there she laid her eggs, there her young in due time were hatched, every time the groom enters or leaves the stable on his elephant, he strikes with his hook at the crow and her nestlings, and destroys the nest, the crow in distress wishes to tear his eye and spoke as she did. If you are well-disposed to her, send for Bandhura and prevent him from destroying the nest.&rdquo; The king sent for him, rebuked and removed him, and gave the elephant to another.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;On the peak of your palace-roof, great king, there is a wood-insect; it had eaten all the fig-wood there and could not eat the harder wood, lacking food and unable to get away, it made the third sound in lamentation, you need have no fear from it,&rdquo; and so by his knowledge giving precisely the insect&rsquo;s meaning he spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve eaten all the fig-wood round as far as it would go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hard wood a weevil likes it not, though other food runs low.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king sent a servant and by some means had the weevil set free. <span class="t18">[3.259]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;In your habitation, great king, is there a certain tame cuckoo?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Great king, that cuckoo was pining for the forest when it remembered its former life, &ldquo;How can I leave this cage, and go to my dear forest?&rdquo; and so made the fourth sound, you need have no fear from it,&rdquo; and so he spoke the fourth verse: <span class="t18">{3.432}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Oh to leave this royal dwelling! Oh to gain my liberty,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Glad at heart to roam the wood, and build my nest upon the tree.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So saying, he added, &ldquo;The cuckoo is pining, great king, set her free.&rdquo; The king did so.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Great king, is there a tame deer in your habitation?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;He was chief of the herd, remembering his hind and pining for love of her he made the fifth sound, you need have no fear from it,&rdquo; and he spoke the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Oh to leave this royal dwelling! Oh to gain my liberty,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Drink pure water of the fountain, lead the herd that followed me!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being caused this deer too to be set free and went on, &ldquo;Great king, is there a tame monkey in your habitation?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;He was chief of a herd in the Himālayas, and he was fond of the society of female monkeys, he was brought here by a hunter named Bharata, pining and longing for his old haunts he made the sixth sound, you need have no fear from it,&rdquo; and he spoke the sixth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Filled and stained was I with passions, with desire infatuate,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bharata the hunter took me; may I bring you happy fate!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9742"></a>The Great Being caused the monkey too to be set free, and went on, &ldquo;Great king, is there a Kinnara living in your habitation?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;He is thinking of what he did with his wife <span class="t18">{3.433}</span> and in the pain of desire made the seventh sound. One day he had climbed the peak of a high mountain with her, they plucked and decked themselves with many flowers of choice hue and scent, and never noticed that the sun was setting; darkness fell as they were descending. The Kinnarī said: &ldquo;Husband, it is dark, come down carefully without stumbling,&rdquo; and taking him by the hand, she led him down. It was in memory of her words that he made the sound, you need have no fear from it.&rdquo; By his knowledge he stated and made known the circumstance precisely, and spoke the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;When the darkness gathered thickly on the mountain summit lone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Stumble not, she gently warned me, with your foot against a stone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9743"></a>So the Great Being explained why the Kinnara had made the sound, and caused him to be set free, and went on, &ldquo;Great king, there was an eighth sound, an exalted utterance. A certain Paccekabuddha in the Nandamūla cave knowing that the conditions of life were now at an end for him came to <span class="t18">[3.260] </span><a id="a9744"></a>the abode of man, thinking: &ldquo;I will enter into Nibbāna in the king of Benares&rsquo; park, his servants will bury me, and hold sacred festival and venerate my relics and so attain heaven,&rdquo; he was coming by his Supernormal Powers and just as he reached your palace-roof, he threw off the burden of life and uttered an exalted utterance, a song that lights up the entrance into the city of Nibbāna,&rdquo; and so he spoke the verse uttered by the Paccekabuddha, <span class="t18">{3.434}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Surely I see the end of birth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I ne&rsquo;er again the womb shall see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My last existence on the earth</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is o&rsquo;er, and all its misery.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">With this exalted utterance he reached your park and passed into Nibbāna at the foot of a Sāl tree in full flower, come, great king, and perform his funeral rites.&rdquo; So the Great Being took the king to the place where the Paccekabuddha entered into Nibbāna and showed him the body. Seeing the body, the king with a great army paid honour with perfumes and flowers and the like. By the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s advice he stopped the sacrifice, gave all the creatures their lives, made proclamation by drum through the city that there should be no slaughter, caused sacred festival to be held for seven days, had the Paccekabuddha&rsquo;s body burnt with great honour on a pyre heaped with perfumes and made a stūpa where four high roads meet. The Bodhisatta preached Dhamma to the king and exhorted him to diligence, then he went to the Himālayas and there did meditate on the Divine Abidings,<a id="a9745"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15679"><span class="t9">{687}</span></a> and without a break in his Absorption became destined for the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Great king, there is no danger at all to you from that sound, stop the sacrifice and give all these creatures their lives,&rdquo; and having caused proclamation to be made by drum that their lives were spared, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the king was Ānanda, the pupil was Sāriputta, and the ascetic was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present a maid is allowed to wear her mistress&rsquo; costly ornament. A thief seeing it tries to kill her and take it, but she kills him instead. The Buddha tells a story of a courtesan who saved a thief from execution, but later the thief planned to kill her for her ornaments, until she tricked and killed him first.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = Devatā,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the pair (the woman and the thief) = the same in the past (ubho).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Here is a golden necklace.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{3.435}</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a female servant of Anāthapiṇḍika. The story is that one feast-day, when she was going with a number of fellow-servants to a pleasure-garden, she asked her mistress Paṇṇalakkhaṇadevī for an ornament to wear.</span><span class="t18"> [3.261]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Her mistress gave her an ornament of her own, worth a hundred thousand pieces. She put it on and went along with the other servants to the pleasure-garden.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9752"></a><span class="t30">A certain thief coveted the ornament, and with the design of killing her and taking it he began talking to her, and in the garden he gave her fish, flesh and strong drink. &ldquo;He does it, I suppose, because he desires me,&rdquo; she thought, and at evening when the others lay down to rest after their sports, she rose and went to him. He said: &ldquo;Mistress, this place is not private; let us go a little farther.&rdquo; She thought,</span><a id="a9753"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15681"><span class="t9">{688}</span></a><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Anything private can be done in this place, no doubt he must be anxious to kill me and take what I am wearing, I&rsquo;ll teach him a lesson,&rdquo; so she said: &ldquo;Teacher, I am dry owing to the strong drink, get me some water,&rdquo; and taking him to a well asked him to draw some water, showing him the rope and bucket. The thief let down the bucket. Then as he was stooping to draw up the water, the girl, who was very strong, pushed him hard with both hands and threw him into the well. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t die that way,&rdquo; she said, and threw a large brick upon his head. He died on the spot.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When she came back to the town and gave her mistress the ornament, she said: &ldquo;I have very nearly been killed today for that ornament,&rdquo; and told the whole story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The mistress told Anāthapiṇḍika, and he told the Tathāgata. The Teacher said: &ldquo;Householder, this is not the first time that servant girl has been endowed with wits rising to the occasion; she was so before also, it is not the first time she killed that man; she did it once before,&rdquo; and at Anāthapiṇḍika&rsquo;s request, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, there was a beautiful woman of the town, called Sulasā, who had a train of five-hundred courtesans, and whose price was a thousand pieces a night.</p>
<p class="p7">There was in the same city a robber named Sattuka, <span class="t18">{3.436}</span> as strong as an elephant, who used to enter rich men&rsquo;s houses at night and plunder at will. The townsmen assembled and complained to the king. The king ordered the city-watch to post bands here and there, have the robber caught and cut off his head. They bound his hands behind his back and led him to the place of execution, scourging him in every square with whips. The news that he was taken excited the whole city.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9754"></a>Sulasā was standing at a window, and looking down on the street she saw the robber, loved him at sight and thought: &ldquo;If I can free that stout fighting-man, I will give up this bad life of mine and live respectably with him.&rdquo; In the way described in the Kaṇaverajātaka [Ja 318]<a id="a9755"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15683"><span class="t9">{689}</span></a> she gained his freedom by sending a thousand pieces to the chief constable of the city and then lived with him in delight and harmony.</p>
<p class="p7">The robber after three or four months thought: &ldquo;I shall never be able to stay in this one place, but one can&rsquo;t go empty-handed, Sulasā&rsquo;s ornaments are worth a hundred thousand pieces, I will kill her and take them.&rdquo; So he said to her one day, &ldquo;Dear, when I was being hauled along by the king&rsquo;s men, I promised an offering to a Tree Devatā on a mountaintop, who is now threatening me because I have not paid it, let us make an offering.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, husband, prepare and send it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear, it will <span class="t18">[3.262] </span>not do to send it, let us both go and present it, wearing all our ornaments and with a great retinue.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, husband, we&rsquo;ll do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">He made her prepare the offering and when they reached the mountain-foot, he said: &ldquo;Dear, the deity, seeing this crowd of people, will not accept the offering; let us two go up and present it.&rdquo; She consented, and he made her carry the vessel. He was himself armed to the teeth, and when they reached the top, he set the offering <span class="t18">{3.437}</span> at the foot of a tree which grew beside a precipice a hundred times as high as a man, and said: &ldquo;Dear, I have not come to present the offering, I have come with the intention of killing you and going away with all your ornaments, take them all off and make a bundle of them in your outer garment.&rdquo; &ldquo;Husband, why would you kill me?&rdquo; &ldquo;For your money.&rdquo; &ldquo;Husband, remember the good I have done you, when you were being hauled along in chains, I gave up a rich man&rsquo;s son for you and paid a large sum and saved your life, though I might get a thousand pieces a day, I never look at another man, such a benefactress I am to you, do not kill me, I will give you much money and be your slave.&rdquo; With these entreaties she spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Here is a golden necklace, and emeralds and pearls,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Take all and welcome, give me place among your servant girls.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When Sattuka had spoken the second verse in accordance with his purpose, to wit,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Fair lady, lay your jewels down and do not weep so sore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ll kill you, else I can&rsquo;t be sure you&rsquo;ll give me all your store,&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sulasā&rsquo;s wits rose to the occasion, and thinking: &ldquo;This robber will not give me my life, but I&rsquo;ll take his life first by throwing him down the precipice in some way,&rdquo; she spoke the two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Within my years of sense, within my conscious memory,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No man on earth, I do protest, have I loved more than you.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Come hither, for my last salute, receive my last embrace,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For never more upon the earth shall we meet face to face.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sattuka could not see her purpose, so he said: &ldquo;Very well, dear; come and embrace me.&rdquo; Sulasā walked round him in respectful salutation three times, kissed him, and saying: &ldquo;Now, husband, I am going <span class="t18">{3.438}</span> to make obeisance to you on all four sides,&rdquo; she put her head on his foot, did obeisance at his sides, and went behind him as if to do obeisance there, then with the strength of an elephant she took him by the hinder parts and threw him head over heels down that place of destruction a hundred times as high as a man. He was crushed to pieces and died on the spot. Seeing this deed, the deity who lived on the mountain-top spoke these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Wisdom at times is not confined to men</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A woman can show wisdom now and then. </span><span class="t18">[3.263]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Wisdom at times is not confined to men,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Women are quick in counsel now and then.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. How quick and keen she was the way to know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She slew him like a deer with full-stretched bow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. He that to great occasion fails to rise</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Falls, like that dull thief from the precipice.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. One prompt a crisis in his fate to see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like her, is saved from threatening enemy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So Sulasā killed the robber. When she descended from the mountain and came among her attendants, they asked where her husband was. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; she said, and mounting her chariot she went on to the city. <span class="t18">{3.439}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the two then were the same two now, the deity was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a9763"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Anger, Murder, Restraint.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Conscious of an angry frown.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this tale while dwelling at Jetavana, concerning the admonition of a king. On this occasion the Teacher, at the king&rsquo;s request, told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as the son of his chief queen. When he grew up, he became king on his father&rsquo;s death and gave abundant alms. He had a park-keeper named Sumaṅgala. A certain Paccekabuddha left the Nandamūla cave on a pilgrimage for alms, and coming to Benares stayed in the park. Next day he went into the town to beg. The king saw him with favour, made him come up into the palace and sit on the throne, waited on him with various delicate kinds of food, both hard and soft, and received his thanks, being pleased that the Paccekabuddha should stay in his park, he exacted a promise and sent him back there, after his morning meal he went there in person, arranged the places for his habitation by night <span class="t18">[3.264] </span>and day, gave him the park-keeper Sumaṅgala as attendant, and went back to the town. After that the Paccekabuddha had meals constantly in the palace and lived there a long time, Sumaṅgala respectfully attended on him.</p>
<p class="p7">One day he went away, saying to Sumaṅgala, &ldquo;I am going to such and such a village for a few days, but will come back, inform the king.&rdquo; Sumaṅgala informed the king. After a few days stay in that village the Paccekabuddha came back to the park in the evening after sunset. <span class="t18">{3.440}</span> Sumaṅgala, not knowing of his arrival, had gone to his own house. The Paccekabuddha put away his bowl and robe, and after a little walk sat down on a stone-slab. That day some strange guests had come to the park-keeper&rsquo;s house. To get them soup and curry he had gone with a bow to kill a tame deer in the park, he was there looking for a deer when he saw the Paccekabuddha and thinking he was a great deer, he aimed an arrow and shot him. The Paccekabuddha uncovered his head and said: &ldquo;Sumaṅgala.&rdquo; Greatly moved Sumaṅgala said: &ldquo;Sir, I knew not of your coming and shot you, thinking you were a deer, forgive me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, but what will you do now? Come, pull out the arrow.&rdquo; He made obeisance and pulled it out. The Paccekabuddha felt great pain and passed into Nibbāna then and there.</p>
<p class="p7">The park-keeper thought the king would not pardon him if he knew, he took his wife and children and fled. By supernatural power the whole city heard that the Paccekabuddha had entered Nibbāna, and all were greatly excited. Next day some men entered the park, saw the body and told the king that the park-keeper had fled after killing the Paccekabuddha. The king went with a great retinue and for seven days paid honour to the body, then with all ceremony he took the relics, built a shrine, and doing honour to it went on ruling his kingdom righteously.</p>
<p class="p7">After a year, Sumaṅgala determined to find out what the king thought, he came and asked a minister whom he saw to find out what the king thought of him. The minister praised Sumaṅgala before the king, but he was as if he had not heard it. The minister said no more, but told Sumaṅgala that the king was not pleased with him. After another year he came, and again in the third year he brought his wife and children. The minister knew the king was appeased, <span class="t18">{3.441}</span> and setting Sumaṅgala at the palace-door told the king of his coming. The king sent for him, and after greeting said: &ldquo;Sumaṅgala, why did you kill that Paccekabuddha, through whom I was gaining merit?&rdquo; &ldquo;O king, I did not mean to kill him, but it was in this way that I did the deed,&rdquo; and he told the story.</p>
<p class="p7">The king bade him have no fear, and reassuring him made him park-keeper again. Then the minister asked, &ldquo;O king, why did you make no answer when you heard Sumaṅgala&rsquo;s praises twice, and on the third hearing why did you send for him and forgive him?&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;Dear sir, it is wrong for a king to do anything hastily in his anger, therefore I was silent at first and the third time when I <span class="t18">[3.265] </span>knew I was appeased I sent for Sumaṅgala,&rdquo; and so he spoke these verses to declare the duty of a king,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Conscious of an angry frown,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ne&rsquo;er let king stretch out his rod,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Things unworthy of a crown</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then would follow from his nod.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Conscious of a milder mood,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let him judgments harsh decree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When the case is understood,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fix the proper penalty,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Self nor others will he vex,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Clearly parting right from wrong,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though his yoke is on men&rsquo;s necks,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Virtue holds him high and strong.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Princes reckless in their deed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ply the rod remorselessly,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ill repute is here their meed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hell awaits them when they die. </span><span class="t18">{3.442}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. They who love the saintly law,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pure in deed and word and thought,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Filled with kindness, calm and awe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pass through both worlds as they ought.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. King am I, my people&rsquo;s lord;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pity prompts the punishment.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.443}</span></p>
<p class="p6">So the king declared his own good qualities in six verses: his whole court were pleased and declared his merits in the words, &ldquo;Such excellence in moral practices and qualities is worthy of your majesty.&rdquo; Sumaṅgala, after the court had finished speaking, saluted the king, and after obeisance spoke three verses in the king&rsquo;s praise,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Such your glory and your power;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ne&rsquo;er resign them for an hour,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Free from anger, free from fears,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Reign in joy a hundred years.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. Prince, whom all those virtues bless,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mild and bland, but firm in worth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Rule the world with righteousness,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pass to heaven when freed from earth.</span></p>

His wife and children and all his household and servants down to the calf-herders kept six fast days every month.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9771"></a>At that time the Bodhisatta was born in a certain poor family and lived a hard life on workman&rsquo;s wages. Hoping to get work he came to Suciparivāra&rsquo;s house, saluting and sitting on one side, he was asked his errand and said: &ldquo;It was to get work for wages in your house.&rdquo;<a id="a9772"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15685"><span class="t9">{690}</span></a> When other workmen came to him, the merchant used to say to them, &ldquo;In this house the workmen keep the moral precepts, if you can keep them you may work for me,&rdquo; but to the Bodhisatta he made no hint in the way of mentioning moral precepts but said, <span class="t18">{3.445}</span> &ldquo;Very well, my good man, you can work for me and arrange about your wages.&rdquo; Thenceforth the Bodhisatta did all the merchant&rsquo;s work meekly and heartily, without a thought of his own weariness; he went early to work and came back at evening.</p>
<p class="p7">One day they proclaimed a festival in the city. The merchant said to a female servant, &ldquo;This is a holy day, you must cook some rice for the workers in the morning, they will eat it early and fast the rest of the day.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta rose early and went to his work, no one had told him to fast that day. The other workers ate in the morning and then fasted, the merchant with his wife, children and attendants kept the fast, all went, each to his own abode, and sat there meditating on the moral precepts.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta worked all day and came home at sunset. The cook-maid gave him water for his hands, and offered him in a dish of rice taken from the boiler. The Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;At this hour there is a great noise on ordinary days, where have they all gone today?&rdquo; &ldquo;They are all keeping the fast, each in his own abode.&rdquo; He thought: &ldquo;I will not be the only person misconducting himself among so <span class="t18">[3.267] </span>many people of moral conduct,&rdquo; so he went and asked the merchant if the fast could be kept at all by undertaking the duties of the day at that hour. He told him that the whole duty could not be done, because it had not been undertaken in the morning; but half the duty could be done. &ldquo;So far be it,&rdquo; he answered, and undertaking the duty in his master&rsquo;s presence he began to keep the fast, and going to his own abode he lay there meditating on the precepts.</p>
<p class="p7">He had taken no food all day, and in the last watch he felt pain like a spear-wound. The merchant brought him various remedies and told him to eat them, but he said: &ldquo;I will not break the fast I have undertaken, though it cost my life.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.446}</span> The pain became intense and at sunrise he was losing consciousness. They told him he was dying, and taking him out they set him in a place of retirement.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9773"></a>At this moment the king of Benares in a noble chariot with a great retinue had reached that spot in a progress round the city. The Bodhisatta, seeing the royal splendour, felt a desire for royalty and prayed for it. Dying, he was conceived again, in consequence of keeping half the Uposatha, in the womb of the chief queen. She went through the ceremonies of pregnancy, and bore a son after ten months. He was named prince Udaya. When he grew up he became perfect in all sciences, by his memory of previous births he knew his former action of merit, and thinking it was a great reward for a little action he repeated an exalted utterance again and again. At his father&rsquo;s death he gained the kingdom, and observing his own great glory he sang the same exalted utterance.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9774"></a>One day they made ready for a festival in the city. A great multitude were intent on amusement. A certain water-carrier who lived by the north gate of Benares had hid a half-penny in a brick in a boundary wall. He cohabited with a poor woman who also made her living by carrying water. She said to him, &ldquo;My lord, there is a festival in the town, if you have any money, let us enjoy ourselves.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have, dear.&rdquo; &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; &ldquo;A half-penny.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;In a brick by the north gate, twelve leagues from here I leave my treasure, but have you got anything in hand?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have.&rdquo; &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; &ldquo;A half-penny.&rdquo; &ldquo;So yours and mine together make a whole penny, we&rsquo;ll buy a garland with one part of it, perfume with another, and strong drink with a third, go and fetch your half-penny from where you put it.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.447}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9775"></a>He was delighted to catch the idea suggested by his wife&rsquo;s words, and saying: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble, dear, I will fetch it,&rdquo; he set out. The man was as strong as an elephant, he went more than six leagues, and though it was midday and he was treading on sand as hot as if it were strewn with coals just off the flame, he was delighted with the desire of gain and in<a id="a9776"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15687"><span class="t9">{691}</span></a> old yellow clothes with a palm-leaf fastened in his ear he went by the palace court in pursuit of his purpose, singing a <span class="t18">[3.268] </span>song. King Udaya stood at an open window, and seeing him coming wondered who it was, who disregarding such wind and heat went singing for joy, and sent a servant to call him up. &ldquo;The king calls for you,&rdquo; he was told, but he said: &ldquo;What is the king to me? I don&rsquo;t know the king.&rdquo; He was taken by force and stood on one side. Then the king spoke two verses in enquiry:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;The earth&rsquo;s like coals, the ground like embers hot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You sing your song, the great heat burns you not.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. The sun on high, the sands below are hot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You sing your song, the great heat burns you not.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing the king&rsquo;s words he spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis these desires that burn, and not the sun,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis all these pressing tasks that must be done.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.448}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king asked what his business was. He answered, &ldquo;O king, I was living by the south gate with a poor woman, she proposed that she and I should amuse ourselves at the festival and asked if I had anything in hand, I told her I had a treasure stored inside a wall by the north gate, she sent me for it to help us to amuse ourselves, those words of hers never leave my heart and as I think of them hot desire burns me, that is my business.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then what delights you so much that you disregard wind and sun, and sing as you go?&rdquo; &ldquo;O king, I sing to think that when I fetch my treasure I shall amuse myself along with her.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, my good man, is your treasure, hidden by the north gate, a hundred thousand pieces?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo; Then the king asked in succession if it were fifty thousand, forty, thirty, twenty, ten, five, four, three, two gold pieces, one piece, half a piece, a quarter piece, four pence, three, two, one penny. The man said: &ldquo;No&rdquo; to all these questions and then, &ldquo;It is a half-penny, indeed, O king, that is all my treasure, but I am going in hopes of fetching it and then amusing myself with her, and in that desire and delight the wind and sun do not annoy me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king said: &ldquo;My good man, don&rsquo;t go there in such a heat, I will give you a half-penny.&rdquo; &ldquo;O king, I will take you at your word and accept it, but I won&rsquo;t lose the other, I won&rsquo;t give up going there and fetching it too.&rdquo; &ldquo;My good man, stay here, I&rsquo;ll give you a penny, two pence,&rdquo; then offering more and more he went on to a crore, a hundred crores, boundless wealth, if the man would stay. But he always answered, &ldquo;O king, I&rsquo;ll take it, but I&rsquo;ll fetch the other too.&rdquo; Then he was tempted by offers of posts as treasurer and posts of various kinds and the position of viceroy, at last he was offered half the kingdom <span class="t18">{3.449}</span> if he would stay. Then he consented. The king said to his ministers, &ldquo;Go, have my friend shaved and bathed and adorned, and bring him back.&rdquo; They did so. The king divided his kingdom in two and gave him half, but they say that he took the northern half from <span class="t18">[3.269] </span><a id="a9777"></a>love of his half-penny. He was called king Aḍḍhamāsaka [Half-Penny].</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9778"></a>They ruled the kingdom in friendship and harmony. One day they went to the park together. After amusing themselves, king Udaya lay down with his head in king Aḍḍhamāsaka&rsquo;s lap. He fell asleep, while the attendants were going here and there enjoying their amusements. King Aḍḍhamāsaka thought: &ldquo;Why should I always have only half the kingdom? I will kill him and be sole king,&rdquo; so he drew his sword, but thinking to strike him remembered that the king had made him, when poor and mean, his partner and set him in great power, and that the thought which had risen in his mind to kill such a benefactor was a wicked one, so he sheathed the sword. A second and a third time the same thought rose. Feeling that this thought, rising again and again, would lead him on to the evil deed, he threw the sword on the ground and woke the king. &ldquo;Pardon me, O king,&rdquo; he said and fell at his feet. &ldquo;Friend, you have done me no wrong.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have, O great king, I did such and such a thing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, friend, I pardon you, if you desire it, be sole king, and I will serve under you as viceroy.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;O king, I have no need of the kingdom, such a desire will cause me to be reborn in evil states, the kingdom is yours, take it, I will become an ascetic, I have seen the root of desire, it grows from a man&rsquo;s intentions, <span class="t18">{3.450}</span> from henceforth I will have no such intention,&rdquo; and so uttered and exalted utterance, with this fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;I have seen your roots, Desire, in a man&rsquo;s own will they lie.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will no more wish for you, and you, Desire, shall die.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So saying, he spoke the fifth verse declaring the Dhamma unto a great multitude devoted to desires:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Little desire is not enough, and much but brings us pain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ah! Foolish men, be sober, friends, if you would wisdom gain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So declaring the Dhamma unto the multitude, he entrusted the realm to king Udaya, leaving the weeping multitude with tears on their faces, he went to the Himālayas, became an ascetic and attained the Absorptions and Super Knowledges. At the time of his becoming an ascetic, king Udaya spoke the sixth verse, an exalted utterance,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Little desire has brought me all the fruit,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Great is the glory Udaya acquires;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mighty the gain if one is resolute</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To be one gone forth and forsake desires.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.451}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9779"></a>No one knew the meaning of this verse. One day the chief queen asked him the meaning of it. The king would not tell. There was a certain court-barber, called Gaṅgamāla, who when attending to the king used to use the razor first, and then grasp the hairs with his tweezers.<a id="a9780"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15689"><span class="t9">{692}</span></a><span class="t18"> [3.270]</span></p>
<p class="p7">The king liked the first operation, but the second gave him pain, at the first he would have given the barber a boon, at the second he would have cut his head off. One day he told the queen about it, saying that their court-barber was a fool, when she asked what he ought to do, he answered, &ldquo;Use the tweezers first and the razor afterwards.&rdquo; She sent for the barber and said: &ldquo;My good man, when you are trimming the king&rsquo;s beard you ought to take his hairs with your tweezers first and use the razor afterwards, then if the king offers you a boon, you must say you don&rsquo;t want anything else, but wish to know the meaning of his song, if you do, I will give you much money.&rdquo; He agreed.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9781"></a>On the next day when he was trimming the king&rsquo;s beard, he took the tweezers first. The king said: &ldquo;Gaṅgamāla, is this a new fashion of yours?&rdquo; &ldquo;O king,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;barbers have got a new fashion,&rdquo; and he grasped the king&rsquo;s hair with the tweezer first, using the razor afterwards. The king offered him a boon. &ldquo;O king, I do not want anything else; tell me the meaning of your exalted utterance in verse.&rdquo; The king was ashamed to tell what his occupation had been in his days of poverty, and said: &ldquo;My good man, what is the use of such a boon to you? Choose something else,&rdquo; but the barber begged for it. The king feared to break his word and agreed. As described in the Kummāsapiṇḍajātaka [Ja 415] he made all arrangements and seated on a jewelled throne, told the whole story of his former act of merit in his last existence in that city. &ldquo;That explains,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;half the verse; for the rest, my comrade became an ascetic, I in my pride am sole king now, <span class="t18">{3.452}</span> and that explains the second half of my exalted utterance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Hearing him the barber thought: &ldquo;So the king got this glory for keeping half a fast day, virtue is the right course, what if I were to become an ascetic and work out my own safety?&rdquo; He left all his relatives and worldly goods, gained the king&rsquo;s permission to become an ascetic and going to the Himālayas he became an ascetic, realised the three qualities of mundane things, gained perfect insight, and became a Paccekabuddha. He had a bowl and robes made by Supernormal Powers. After spending five or six years on the mountain Gaṅgamāla he wished to see the king of Benares, and passing through the air to the royal park there, he sat on the royal stone seat.</p>
<p class="p7">The park-keeper told the king that Gaṅgamāla, now a Paccekabuddha, had come through the air and was sitting in the park. The king went at once to salute the Paccekabuddha, and the queen-mother went out with her son. The king entered the park, saluted him and sat on one side with his retinue. The Paccekabuddha spoke to him in a friendly manner, &ldquo;Brahmadatta (calling him by the name of the clan), are you diligent, ruling the kingdom righteously, doing charitable and other good works?&rdquo; The queen-mother was angry. &ldquo;This low-caste shampooing son of a <span class="t18">[3.271] </span>barber does not know his place, he calls my kingly high-descended son, Brahmadatta,&rdquo; and she spoke the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Penance forsooth makes men forsake their wrongs,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their barber&rsquo;s, potter&rsquo;s, stations every one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Through penance Gaṅgamāla glory wins,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Brahmadatta now he calls my son.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.453}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king checked his mother and declaring the qualities of the Paccekabuddha, he spoke the eighth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Lo! How, e&rsquo;er his death befall,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Meekness brings a man its fruit!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">One who bowed before us all,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kings and lords must now salute.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Though the king checked his mother, the rest of the multitude rose up and said: &ldquo;It is not decent that such a low-caste person should speak to you by name in that way.&rdquo; The king rebuked the multitude, and spoke the last verse to declare the virtues of the Paccekabuddha,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;Scorn not Gaṅgamāla so,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Perfect in dispensation&rsquo;s ways,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He has crossed the waves of woe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Free from sorrow now he strays.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So saying the king saluted the Paccekabuddha and asked him to forgive the queen-mother. The Paccekabuddha did so and the king&rsquo;s retinue also gained his forgiveness. The king wished him to promise that he would stay in the neighbourhood, but he refused, and standing in the air before the eyes of the whole court he admonished the king and went away to Gandhamādana. <span class="t18">{3.454}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson the Teacher said: &ldquo;Laymen, you see how keeping the fast is proper to be done,&rdquo; and he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the Paccekabuddha entered into Nibbāna, king Aḍḍhamāsaka was Ānanda, the chief queen was the mother of Rāhula, king Udaya was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h3 class="h30"><a id="ncx15801"></a><a id="a9782"></a><a id="a9783"></a><a id="a9784"></a><a id="a9785"></a><a id="a9786"></a>Ja 422 Cetiyajātaka<br/>The Story about (the King of) Cetiya (8s)</h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks are discussing how Devadatta told lies and sank into Avīci. The Buddha tells a story of the golden age, and the first king to tell a lie; how he refused to repent and gradually sank deeper into the earth till he was swallowed up and fell into hell.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the brahmin (priest) Kapila (Kapilabrāhmaṇa),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a9787"></a><span class="t15">Devadatta = king of Cetiya (Cetiyarājā).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9788"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Truth, Speech, Falsehood, Devas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Injured Dhamma can injure sorely.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this tale while dwelling at Jetavana, concerning Devadatta&rsquo;s being swallowed up by the earth.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On that day they were discussing in the Dhamma Hall how Devadatta had spoken </span><span class="t18">[3.272] </span><span class="t30">falsely, had sunk into the ground and become destined to the hell Avīci. The Teacher came and, hearing the subject of their talk, said: &ldquo;This is not the first time he sank into the earth,&rdquo; and so he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9789"></a>In the past, in the first age, there was a king named Mahāsammata, whose life was an asaṅkheyya<a id="a9790"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15691"><span class="t9">{693}</span></a> long. His son was Roja, his son Vararoja, and then the succession was Kalyāṇa, Varakalyāṇa, Uposatha, Mandhātā, Varamandhātā, Cara, Upacara, who was also called Apacara. He reigned over the kingdom of Ceti, in the city of Sotthivati; he was endowed with four supernatural powers &ndash; he could walk aloft and pass through the air, he had four Devaputtas in each of the four quarters to defend him with drawn swords, he diffused the fragrance of sandalwood from his body, he diffused the fragrance of the lotus from his mouth.</p>
<p class="p7">His family priest was named Kapila. This brahmin&rsquo;s younger brother, Korakalamba, had been taught along with the king by the same teacher and was the king&rsquo;s playmate. When Apacara was prince, <span class="t18">{3.455}</span> he promised to make Korakalamba his family priest when he became king. At his father&rsquo;s death he became king, but he could not depose Kapila from the position of family priest, and when Kapila came to wait on him, he showed him special forms of honour. The brahmin observed this and considered that a king manages best with ministers of his own age, and that he himself might get leave from the king to become an ascetic, so he said: &ldquo;O king, I am getting old; I have a son at home, make him family priest and I will become an ascetic.&rdquo; He got the king&rsquo;s leave and had his son appointed family priest, then he went to the king&rsquo;s park, became an ascetic, reached the Absorptions and Super Knowledges and lived there, near his son.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9791"></a>Korakalambaka felt a grudge against his brother because he had not got him his post when he became an ascetic. One day the king said to him in friendly conversation, &ldquo;Korakalambaka, you are not family priest?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, O king, my brother has managed it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Has not your brother become an ascetic?&rdquo; &ldquo;He has, but he got the post for his son.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then do you manage it.&rdquo; &ldquo;O king, it is impossible for me to set aside my brother and take a post which has come by descent.&rdquo; &ldquo;If so, I will make you senior and the other your junior.&rdquo; &ldquo;How, O king?&rdquo; &ldquo;By a lie.&rdquo;<a id="a9792"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15693"><span class="t9">{694}</span></a> &ldquo;O king, do you not know that my brother is a magician, endowed with great supernatural power? He will deceive you with magical illusions, he will make your four Devaputtas disappear, and make as it were an evil odour come from your body and mouth, he will make you come down from the sky and stand on the ground, you will be as if swallowed up by the earth, and you will not be able to abide by your story.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not trouble; I will manage it.&rdquo;<span class="t18"> [3.273]</span> &ldquo;When will you do it, O king?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.456}</span> &ldquo;On the seventh day from this.&rdquo; The story went round the city, &ldquo;The king is going to make the senior the junior by a lie, and will give the post to the junior, what kind of a thing is a lie? Is it blue or yellow or some other colour?&rdquo; The multitude thought greatly about it.</p>
<p class="p7">It was a time, they say, when the world told the truth, men did not know what the word &lsquo;lie&rsquo; might mean. The priest&rsquo;s son heard the tale and told his father, &ldquo;Father, they say the king is going by a lie to make you junior and to give our post to my uncle.&rdquo; &ldquo;My dear, the king will not be able even by a lie to take our post from us, on what day is he going to do it?&rdquo; &ldquo;On the seventh day from this, they say.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let me know when the time comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">On the seventh day a great multitude gathered in the king&rsquo;s courtyard sitting in rows above rows, hoping to see a lie. The young priest went and told his father. The king was ready in full dress, he appeared and stood in the air in the courtyard amid the multitude. The ascetic came through the air, spread his skin-seat before the king, sat on his throne in the air and said: &ldquo;Is it true, O king, that you wish by a lie to make the junior senior and to give him the post?&rdquo; &ldquo;Teacher, I have done so.&rdquo; Then he admonished the king, &ldquo;O great king, a lie is a grievous destruction of good qualities, it causes rebirth in the four evil states; a king who makes a lie destroys right, and by destroying right he is himself destroyed,&rdquo; and he spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9793"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Injured Dhamma injures sorely, and requite with injury;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus Dhamma should ne&rsquo;er be injured, lest the harm recoil on you.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.457}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Admonishing him farther he said: &ldquo;Great king, if you make a lie, your four Supernormal Powers will disappear,&rdquo; and he spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;The powers divine forsake and leave the man who tells a lie,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ill smells his mouth, he cannot keep his foothold in the sky,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whoe&rsquo;er to questioning replies with falsehood wilfully.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9794"></a>Hearing this, the king in fear looked to Korakalambaka. He said: &ldquo;Be not afraid, O king; did I not tell you so from the first?&rdquo; and so forth. The king, though he heard Kapila&rsquo;s words, still put forward his statement, &ldquo;Sir, you are the younger, Korakalambaka is the elder.&rdquo; At the moment when he uttered this lie, the four Devaputtas said they would guard such a liar no longer, threw their swords at his feet and disappeared; his mouth was fetid like a broken rotten egg and his body like an open drain; and falling from the air he lighted on the earth, so all his four Supernormal Powers disappeared. His chief priest said: &ldquo;Great king, be not afraid, if you will speak the truth, I will restore you everything,&rdquo; and so he spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;A word of truth, and all your gifts, O king, you shall regain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A lie will fix you in the soil of Ceti to remain.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.274] {3.458}</span></p>
<p class="p6">He said: &ldquo;Look, O great king, those four Supernormal Powers of yours disappeared first by your lie, consider, for it is possible now to restore them.&rdquo; But the king answered, &ldquo;You wish to deceive me in this,&rdquo; and so telling a second lie he sank in the earth up to the ankles. Then the brahmin said once more, &ldquo;Consider, O great king,&rdquo; and spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Drought comes on him in time of rain, rain when it should be dry,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whoe&rsquo;er to questioning replies with falsehood wilfully.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then once again he said: &ldquo;Owing to your lying you are sunk in the earth up to the ankles, consider, O great king,&rdquo; and spoke the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;One word of truth, and all your gifts, O king, you shall regain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A lie will sink you in the soil of Ceti to remain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But for the third time the king said: &ldquo;You are junior and Korakalambaka is elder,&rdquo; and at this lie he sank in the ground up to the knees. Once more the brahmin said: &ldquo;Consider, O great king,&rdquo; and spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;O king, the man is forked of tongue, and like a serpent sly,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whoe&rsquo;er to questioning replies with falsehood wilfully.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. One word of truth, and all your gifts, O king, you shall regain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A lie will sink you deeper still in Ceti to remain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">adding, &ldquo;Even now all may be restored.&rdquo; The king, not heeding his words, repeated the lie for the fourth time, &ldquo;You are junior, sir, and Korakalambaka is elder,&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.459}</span> and at these words he sank up to the hips. Again the brahmin said: &ldquo;Consider, O great king,&rdquo; and spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;O king, that man is like a fish, and tongueless he shall be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whoe&rsquo;er to questioning replies with falsehood wilfully.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. One word of truth, and all your gifts, O king, you shall regain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A lie will sink you deeper still in Ceti to remain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">For the fifth time the king repeated the lie, and as he did so he sank up to the navel. The brahmin once more appealed to him to consider, and spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Girls only shall be born of him, no male child shall he see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whoe&rsquo;er to questioning replies with falsehood wilfully.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. One word of truth, and all your gifts, O king, you shall regain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A lie will sink you deeper still in Ceti to remain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king paid no heed, and repeating the lie for the sixth time sank up to the breast. The brahmin made his appeal once more and spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;His children will not stay with him, on every side they flee,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whoe&rsquo;er to questioning replies with falsehood wilfully. </span><span class="t18">[3.275]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. One word of truth, and all your gifts, O king, you shall regain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A lie will sink you deeper still in Ceti to remain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Owing to association with a wicked friend, he disregarded the words and repeated the same lie for the seventh time. Then the earth opened and the flames of Avīci leapt up and seized him. <span class="t18">{3.460}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;Cursed by a sage, the king who once could walk the air, they say,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Was lost and swallowed by the earth on his appointed day.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. Wherefore the wise do not approve at all</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When that desire into the heart does fall,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He that is free from guile, whose heart is pure,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All that he says is ever firm and sure.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">These are two verses spoken after Fully Awakening.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9795"></a>The multitude said in fear, &ldquo;The king of Ceti reviled the sage, and told a lie; so he has entered Avīci.&rdquo; The king&rsquo;s five sons came to the brahmin and said: &ldquo;Be you our helper.&rdquo; The brahmin answered, &ldquo;Your father destroyed Dhamma, he lied and reviled a sage, therefore he has entered Avīci. If Dhamma is destroyed, it destroys. You must not dwell here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9796"></a>To the eldest he said: &ldquo;Come, dear, leave the city by the eastern gate and go straight on, you will see a white royal elephant prostrate, touching the earth in seven places,<a id="a9797"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15695"><span class="t9">{695}</span></a> that will be a sign for you to lay out a city there and dwell in it, and the name of it will he Hatthipura.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="p7">To the third prince he said: &ldquo;You leave by the west gate and go straight on till you see a maned lion; that will be a sign that you are to lay out a city there and dwell in it, and it shall be called Sīhapura.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9798"></a>To the fourth prince he said: &ldquo;You leave by the north gate and go straight on till you see a wheel-frame<a id="a9799"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15697"><span class="t9">{696}</span></a> all made of jewels, that will be a sign <span class="t18">{3.461}</span> that you are to lay out a city there and dwell in it, and it shall be called Uttarapañcāla.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">To the fifth he said: &ldquo;You cannot dwell here, build a great shrine in this city, go out towards the north-west, and go straight on till you see two mountains striking against each other and making the sound of <span class="t11">daddara</span>, that will be a sign that you are to lay out a city there and dwell in it, and it shall be called Daddarapura.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">All the five princes went, and following the signs laid out cities there and dwelt in them. <span class="t18">[3.276]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher said: &ldquo;So, monks, this is not the first time that Devadatta has told a lie and sunk in the earth,&rdquo; and then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the king of Ceti was Devadatta, and the brahmin Kapila was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

The story is that a young man of good family at Sāvatthi heard the Teacher&rsquo;s preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymen&rsquo;s houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. </span><span class="t18">{3.462}</span><span class="t30"> He took what he had got to the wife he had left, she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. &ldquo;Salute him and bid him pass on.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, &ldquo;This is the father of my sons.&rdquo; She came out and saluted him, taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food, when he had eaten she saluted again and said: &ldquo;Sir, you are a saint now, we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householder&rsquo;s life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country, be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.&rdquo; For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: &ldquo;I cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life, send a layman&rsquo;s garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.&rdquo; She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Against his will they took him to the Teacher and told him that he was discontent and wished to go back to worldly life. The Teacher said: &ldquo;Is this tale true?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is, Lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who causes you to fall back?&rdquo; &ldquo;My wife.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monk, that woman is the cause of evil to you, formerly also through her you fell from the four stages of Absorption </span><span class="t18">[3.277] </span><span class="t30">and became very miserable, then through me you were delivered from your misery and regained the power of meditation you had lost,&rdquo; and then he told a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{3.463}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as the son of the king&rsquo;s family priest and his brahmin wife. On the day of his birth there was a blazing of weapons all over the city, and so they called his name young Jotipāla.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9813"></a>When he grew up, he learned all the arts at Taxila and showed his skill in them to the king, but he gave up his position, and without telling anyone he went out by the back door, and entering a forest became an ascetic in the Kaviṭṭhaka hermitage, called Sakkadattiya. He attained the Absorptions and Super Knowledges. As he dwelt there many hundreds of sages waited on him. He was attended by a great company and had seven chief disciples. Of them the sage Sālissara left the Kaviṭṭhaka hermitage for the Suraṭṭha country, and dwelt on the banks of the river Sātodikā with many thousand sages in his company, Meṇḍissara with many thousand sages dwelt near the town of Lambacullaka in the country of king Pajaka, Pabbata with many thousand sages dwelt in a certain forest-country, Kāḷadevala with many thousand sages dwelt in a certain wooded mountain in Avantī and the Deccan, Kisavaccha dwelt alone near the city of Kumbhavatī in the park of king Daṇḍaki, the ascetic Anusissa was attendant on the Bodhisatta and stayed with him, Nārada, the younger brother of Kāḷadevala, dwelt alone in a cave-cell amid the mountainous country of Arañjara in the Central Region.</p>
<p class="p7">Now not far from Arañjara there is a certain very populous town. In the town there is a great river, in which many men bathe, and along its banks sit many beautiful courtesans tempting the men. The ascetic Nārada saw one of them and being enamoured of her, forsook his meditations and <span class="t18">{3.464}</span> pining away without food lay in the bonds of love for seven days. His brother Kāḷadevala by reflection knew the cause of this, and came flying through the air into the cave. Nārada saw him and asked why he had come. &ldquo;I knew you were ill and have come to tend you.&rdquo; Nārada repelled him with a falsehood, &ldquo;You are talking nonsense, falsehood, and vanity.&rdquo; The other refused to leave him and brought Sālissara, Meṇḍissara, and Pabbatissara. He repelled them all in the same way. Kāḷadevala went flying to fetch their master Sarabhaṅga and did fetch him. When the Teacher came, he saw that Nārada had fallen into the power of the senses, and asked if it were so. Nārada rose at the words and saluted, and confessed. The Teacher said: &ldquo;Nārada, those who fall into the power of the senses waste away in misery in this life, and in their next existence are born in hell,&rdquo; and so he spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Who through desire obeys the senses&rsquo; sway,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Loses both worlds and pines his life away.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.278]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing him, Nārada answered, &ldquo;Teacher, the following of desires is happiness, why do you call such happiness misery?&rdquo; Sarabhaṅga said: &ldquo;Listen, then,&rdquo; and spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Happiness and misery ever on each other&rsquo;s footsteps press,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You have seen their alternation, seek a truer happiness.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.465}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Nārada said: &ldquo;Teacher, such misery is hard to bear, I cannot endure it.&rdquo; The Great Being said: &ldquo;Nārada, the misery that comes has to be endured,&rdquo; and spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;He who endures in troubled time with troubles to contend</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is strong to reach that final bliss where all our troubles end.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But Nārada answered, &ldquo;Teacher, the happiness of love&rsquo;s desire is the greatest happiness, I cannot abandon it.&rdquo; The Great Being said: &ldquo;Virtue is not to be abandoned for any cause,&rdquo; and spoke the fourth verse: <span class="t18">{3.466}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;For love of sensual desires, for hopes of gain, for miseries, great and small,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do not undo your saintly past, and so from virtue fall.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sarabhaṅga having thus showed forth the Dhamma in four verses. Kāḷadevala in admonition of his younger brother spoke the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9814"></a><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Know</span><a id="a9815"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15699"><span class="t19">{697}</span></a><span class="t12"> the worldly life is trouble, victual should be freely lent.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No delight in gathering riches, no distress when they are spent.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The sixth verse is one spoken by the Teacher after Fully Awakening concerning Devala&rsquo;s admonition of Nārada:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9816"></a><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;So far Black</span><a id="a9817"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15701"><span class="t19">{698}</span></a><span class="t12"> Devala most wisely spoke,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">None worse than he who bows to senses&rsquo; yoke.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.467}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9818"></a>Then Sarabhaṅga spoke in warning, &ldquo;Nārada, listen to this, he who will not do at first what is proper to be done, must weep and lament like the young man who went to the forest,&rdquo; and so he told a story of the past.</p>
<p class="p7">In the past in a certain town of Kāsi there was a certain young brahmin, beautiful, strong, stout as an elephant. His thoughts were, &ldquo;Why should I keep my parents by working on a farm, or have a wife and children, or do good works of generosity and so forth? I won&rsquo;t keep anybody nor do any good work; but I will go into the forest and keep myself by killing deer.&rdquo; So with [3.279] the five kinds of weapons he went to the Himālayas and killed and ate many deer.</p>
<p class="p7">In the Himālayas region he found a great defile, surrounded by mountains, on the banks of the river Vidhavā, and there he lived on the flesh of the slain deer, cooked on hot coals. He thought: &ldquo;I shall not always be strong; when I grow weak I shall not be able to range the forest, now I will drive many kinds of wild animals into this defile, close it up by a gate, and then without roaming the forest I shall kill and eat them at my pleasure,&rdquo; and so he did.</p>
<p class="p7">As time passed over him, that very thing came to pass, and the experience of all the world befell him, he lost control over his hands and feet, he could not move freely here and there, he could not find his food or drink, his body withered, he became the ghost of a man, he showed wrinkles furrowing his body like the earth in a hot season; ill-favoured and ill-knit, he became very miserable. In like manner as time passed, the king of Sivi, named Sivi, had a desire to eat flesh roasted on coals in the forest, so he gave over his kingdom to his ministers, and with the five kinds of weapons he went to the forest and ate the flesh of the deer he slew, in time he came to that spot and saw that man. Although afraid, he summoned courage to ask who he was. &ldquo;Lord, I am the ghost of a man, reaping the fruit of the deeds I have done, who are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;The king of Sivi.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why have you come here?&rdquo; {3.468} &ldquo;To eat the flesh of deer.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Great king, I have become the ghost of a man because I came here with that object,&rdquo; and telling the whole story at length and explaining his misfortune to the king, he spoke the remaining verses:</p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;King, &rsquo;tis with me as if I&rsquo;d been with foes in bitter strife,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">Labour, and skill in handicraft, a peaceful home, a wife,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">All have been lost to me, my works bear fruit in this my life.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">8. Worsted a thousandfold I am, kinless and reft of stay,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">Strayed from the noble Dhamma, like ghost I&rsquo;m fallen away.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">9. This state is mine because I caused, instead of joy, distress,</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="t12">Girt as it were with flaming fire, I have no happiness.&rdquo; {3.469}</span></p>
<p class="p6">With that he added, &ldquo;O king, through desire of happiness I caused misery to others and have even in this life become the ghost of a man, do not you commit evil deeds, go to thine own city and do good deeds of generosity and the like.&rdquo; The king did so and completed the path to heaven.</p>
<p class="p7">The ascetic was roused by the teacher Sarabhaṅga&rsquo;s account of this case. He became agitated, and after saluting and gaining his teacher&rsquo;s pardon, by focusing on the Meditation Object he regained the Absorptions he had lost. Sarabhaṅga refused him leave to stay there, and took him back with him to his own hermitage.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, After the Truths the discontented monk was established in the fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time Nārada was the discontented monk, Sālissara was Sāriputta, Meṇḍissara was Kassapa, Pabbata was Anuruddha, Kāḷadevala was Kaccāna, Anusissa was Ānanda, Kisavaccha was Moggallāna, and Sarabhaṅga was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
