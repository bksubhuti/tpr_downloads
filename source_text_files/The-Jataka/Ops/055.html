<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is very irritable and quick to anger. The Buddha tells a story of a king who took his harem into the forest, and when he had fallen asleep, they gathered round an ascetic who taught patience and forbearance. The king on waking was angered and ordered the ascetic whipped, and had his limbs cut off. Still the ascetic did not get angry. But the king fell into hell.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Whoso cut off.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.26] </span><span class="t30">This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told about a wrathful monk. The incident that gave rise to the story has already been described.</span><a id="a8303"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15448"><span class="t9">{577}</span></a><a id="a8304"></a><span class="t30"> The Teacher asked that monk, saying: &ldquo;Why after taking ordination in the dispensation of the Buddha who knows not what wrath is, do you show anger? Wise men in bygone days, though they suffered a thousand stripes, and had their hands and feet and ears and nose cut off, showed no anger against another.&rdquo; And he then told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past a king of Kāsi named Kalābu reigned at Benares. At that time the Bodhisatta came to life in a brahmin family endowed with eighty crores of treasure, in the form of a youth named Kuṇḍakakumāra. And when he was of age, he acquired a knowledge of all the sciences at Taxila and afterwards settled down as a householder.</p>
<p class="p7">On the death of his parents, looking at his pile of treasure he thought: &ldquo;My kinsmen who amassed this treasure are all gone without taking it with them: now it is for me to own it and in my turn to depart.&rdquo; Then he carefully selected persons, who by virtue of their generosity deserved it, and gave all his wealth to them, and entering the Himālayas he adopted the ascetic life. There he dwelt a long time, living on wild fruits. And descending to the inhabited parts for the sake of procuring salt and vinegar he gradually made his way to Benares, where he lived in the royal park. Next day he went his rounds in the city for alms, till he came to the door of the commander-in-chief. And he, being pleased with the ascetic for the propriety of his behaviour, brought him into the house <span class="t18">{3.40}</span> and fed him with the food prepared for himself. And having gained his consent he got him to take up his abode in the royal park.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8305"></a>Now one day king Kalābu being inflamed with strong drink came into the park in great pomp, surrounded by a company of dancers. Then he had a couch spread on the royal seat of stone, and lay with his head on the lap of a favourite of the harem, while the dancing girls who were skilful in vocal and instrumental music and in dancing provided a musical entertainment. So great was his magnificence, like to that of Sakka, Lord of heaven. And the king fell asleep. Then the women said: &ldquo;He for whose sake we are providing music, is gone to sleep. What need is there for us to sing?&rdquo; Then they cast aside their lutes and other musical instruments <span class="t18">[3.27] </span>here and there, and set out for the garden, where tempted on by the flowers and fruit-bearing shrubs they were soon disporting themselves.</p>
<p class="p7">At this moment the Bodhisatta was seated in this garden, like a royal elephant in the pride of his vigour, at the foot of a flowering Sāl tree, enjoying the bliss of retirement from the world. So these women in wandering about came upon him and said: &ldquo;Come here, ladies, and let us sit down and hear somewhat from the ascetic who is resting at the foot of this tree, until the king awakes.&rdquo; Then they went and saluted him and sitting in a circle round about him, they said: &ldquo;Tell us something worth hearing.&rdquo; So the Bodhisatta preached the Dhamma to them.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8306"></a>Meanwhile the royal favourite with a movement of her body woke up the king. And the king on waking up, and not seeing the women asked, &ldquo;Where are those wretches gone?&rdquo; &ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they are gone away and are sitting in attendance on a certain ascetic.&rdquo; The king in a rage seized his sword and went off in haste, saying: &ldquo;I will give this false ascetic a lesson.&rdquo; Then those of the women that were most in favour, when they saw the king coming in a rage, went and took the sword from the king&rsquo;s hand and pacified him. Then he came and stood by the Bodhisatta and asked, &ldquo;What Dhamma are you preaching, monk?&rdquo; &ldquo;The Dhamma of patience, your majesty,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;What is this patience?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;The not being angry, when men abuse you and strike you and revile you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Said the king, &ldquo;I will see now the reality of your patience,&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.41}</span> and he summoned his executioner. And he in the way of his office took an axe and a scourge of thorns, and clad in a yellow robe and wearing a red garland, came and saluted the king and said: &ldquo;What is your pleasure, sire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Take and drag off this vile rogue of an ascetic,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;and throwing him on the ground, with your lash of thorns scourge him before and behind and on both sides, and give him two thousand stripes.&rdquo; This was done. And the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s outer and inner skins were cut through to the flesh, and the blood flowed. The king again asked, &ldquo;What Dhamma do you preach, monk?&rdquo; &ldquo;The Dhamma of patience, your majesty,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You fancy that my patience is only skin deep. It is not skin deep, but is fixed deep within my heart, where it cannot be seen by you, sire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Again the executioner asked, &ldquo;What is your pleasure, sire?&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;Cut off both the hands of this false ascetic.&rdquo; So he took his axe, and placing the victim within the fatal circle, he cut off both his hands. Then the king said: &ldquo;Off with his feet,&rdquo; and his feet were chopped off. And the blood flowed from the extremities of his hands and feet like lac juice from a leaking jar. Again the king asked what Dhamma he preached. &ldquo;The Dhamma of patience, your majesty,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You imagine, sire, that my patience dwells in the extremities of my hands and feet. It is not there, but it is deep seated somewhere else.&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;Cut off his nose and ears.&rdquo; The <span class="t18">[3.28] </span>executioner did so. His whole body was now covered with blood. Again the king asked of his Dhamma. And the asetic said: &ldquo;Think not that my patience is seated in the tips of my nose and ears: my patience is deep seated within my heart.&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;Lie down, false monk, and thence exalt your patience.&rdquo; And so saying, he struck the Bodhisatta above the heart with his foot, and betook himself off.</p>
<p class="p7">When he was gone, the commander-in-chief wiped off the blood from the body of the Bodhisatta, <span class="t18">{3.42}</span><a id="a8307"></a> putting bandages<a id="a8308"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15450"><span class="t9">{578}</span></a> on the extremities of his hands, feet, ears and nose, and then having gently placed him on a seat, he saluted him and sitting on one side he said: &ldquo;If, venerable sir, you would be angry with one who has wronged you, be angry with the king, but with no one else.&rdquo; And making this request, he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Whoso cut off your nose and ear, and lopped off foot and hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With him be wroth, heroic soul, but spare, we pray, this land.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta on hearing this uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Long live the king, whose cruel hand my body thus has marred,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pure souls like mine such deeds as these with anger ne&rsquo;er regard.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And just as the king was leaving the garden and at the very moment when be passed out of the range of the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s vision, the mighty earth that is two hundred and forty thousand leagues in thickness split in two, like unto a strong stout cloth garment, and a flame issuing forth from Avīci seized upon the king, wrapping him up as it were with a royal robe of scarlet wool. Thus did the king sink into the earth just by the garden gate and was firmly fixed in the great Avīci hell. And the Bodhisatta died on that same day. And the king&rsquo;s servants and the citizens came with perfumes and wreaths and incense in their hands and performed the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s obsequies. And some said that the Bodhisatta had gone straight back to the Himālayas. But in this they said the thing that was not. <span class="t18">{3.43}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;A saint of old, as men have told,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Great courage did display:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That saint so strong to suffer wrong</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The Kāsi king did slay.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Alas, the debt of vain regret</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That king will have to pay;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When doomed to dwell in lowest hell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Long will he rue the day.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">These two verses were spoken after Fully Awakening. <span class="t18">[3.29]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, revealed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the choleric monk attained fruition of the Second Path, while many others attained fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time Devadatta was Kalābu king of Kāsi, Sāriputta was the commander-in-chief, and I myself was the ascetic, who spoke of forbearance.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the king of Kosala hears cries during the night and is worried what they mean. His brahmins tell him that he needs to give a large animal sacrifice to ward off danger. The Buddha tells of a similar event in a past life, and how the cries had been interpreted as the cries of those in hell, and how he had averted a useless sacrifice.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Due share of wealth.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8320"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher, while living at Jetavana, told concerning a king of Kosala. The king of Kosala of those days, they say, one night heard a cry uttered by four inhabitants of hell &ndash; the syllables </span><span class="t34">du, sa, na, so,</span><span class="t30"> one from each of the four. In a previous existence, tradition says, they had been princes in Sāvatthi, and had been guilty of adultery. After misconducting themselves with their neighbours&rsquo; wives, however carefully guarded they might be, and indulging their amorous propensities, their evil life had been cut short by the Wheel of Death, near Sāvatthi. They came to life again in four iron cauldrons. After being tortured for sixty thousand years they had come up to the top, and on seeing the edge of the cauldron&rsquo;s mouth they thought to themselves, &ldquo;When shall we escape from this misery?&rdquo; And then all four uttered a loud cry, one after another. The king was terrified to death at the noise, and sat waiting for break of day, unable to stir.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8321"></a><span class="t30">At dawn the brahmins came and inquired after his health. The king replied, &ldquo;How, my masters, can I be well, </span><span class="t18">{3.44}</span><a id="a8322"></a><span class="t30"> who today have heard four such terrible cries.&rdquo; The brahmins waved their hands.</span><a id="a8323"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15454"><span class="t9">{580}</span></a><a id="a8324"></a><span class="t30"> &ldquo;What is it, my masters?&rdquo; said the king. The brahmins assure him that the sounds are ominous of great violence. &ldquo;Do they admit of remedy, or not?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;You might say not,&rdquo; said the brahmins, &ldquo;but we are well-trained in these matters, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;By what means,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;will you avert these evils?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;there is one great remedy in our power, and by offering the fourfold sacrifice</span><a id="a8325"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15456"><span class="t9">{581}</span></a><span class="t30"> of every living creature we will avert all evil.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then be quick,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;and take all living creatures by fours &ndash; men, bulls, horses, elephants, down to quails and other birds &ndash; and by this fourfold sacrifice restore my peace of mind.&rdquo; The brahmins consented, and taking whatever they required, they dug a sacrificial pit and fastened their numerous victims to their stakes, and were highly excited at the thought of the dainties they were to eat, and the wealth they would gain, and went about backwards and forwards, saying: &ldquo;Sir, I must have so and so.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The queen Mallikā came and asked the king, why the brahmins went about so delighted and smiling. The king said: &ldquo;My queen, what have you to do with this? You are intoxicated with your own glory, and you do not know how wretched I am.&rdquo; &ldquo;How so, sire?&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I have heard such awful noises, my queen, and when I asked the brahmins what would be the result of </span><span class="t18">[3.30] </span><span class="t30">my hearing these cries, they told me I was threatened with danger to my kingdom or my property or my life, but by offering the fourfold sacrifice they would restore my peace of mind, and now in obedience to my command, they have dug a sacrificial pit and are gone to fetch whatever victims they require.&rdquo; The queen said: &ldquo;Have you, my lord, consulted the chief brahmin in the Deva world as to the origin of these cries?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who, lady,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;is the chief brahmin in the Deva world?&rdquo; &ldquo;The Great Gotama,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;the Supreme Buddha.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I have not consulted the Supreme Buddha.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then go,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and consult him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The king hearkened to the words of the queen and after his morning meal he mounted his state chariot and drove to Jetavana. Here after saluting the Teacher he thus addressed him, &ldquo;Venerable sir, in the night season I heard four cries and consulted the brahmins about it. </span><span class="t18">{3.45}</span><span class="t30"> They undertook to restore my peace of mind, by the fourfold sacrifice of every kind of victim, and are now busy preparing a sacrificial pit. What does the hearing of these cries betoken to me?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Nothing whatever,&rdquo; said the Teacher. &ldquo;Certain beings in hell, owing to the agony they suffer, cried aloud. These cries,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;have not been heard by you alone. Kings of old heard the same. And when they too, after consulting their brahmins, were anxious to offer sacrifices of slain victims, on hearing what wise men had to say, they refused to do so. The wise men explained to them the nature of these cries, and bade them let loose the crowd of victims and thus restored their peace of mind.&rdquo; And at the request of the king he told a story of bygone days.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8326"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family, in a certain village of Kāsi. And when he was of mature years, renouncing the pleasures of sense and embracing the ascetic life he developed the Spiritual Knoweldges and Absorption, and enjoying the delights of Absorption took up his abode in a pleasant grove in the Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">The king of Benares at this time was fearfully alarmed by hearing those four sounds uttered by four beings who dwelt in hell. And when told by brahmins in exactly the same way that one of three dangers must befall him, he agreed to their proposal to put a stop to it by the fourfold sacrifice. The family priest with the help of the brahmins provided a sacrificial pit, and a great crowd of victims was brought up and fastened to the stakes. Then the Bodhisatta, guided by a feeling of loving-kindness, regarding the world with his divine eye, when he saw what was going on, said: &ldquo;I must go at once and see to the well-being of all these creatures.&rdquo; And then by his Supernormal Powers flying up into the air, he alighted in the garden of the king of Benares, and sat down on the royal slab of stone, looking like an image of gold.</p>
<p class="p7">The chief disciple of the family priest approached his teacher and asked, &ldquo;Is it not written, Teacher, in our Vedas that there is no happiness for those who take the life of any creature?&rdquo; The priest replied, &ldquo;You are to bring here the king&rsquo;s property, and we shall have abundant dainties to eat. Only hold your peace.&rdquo; And with these words he drove his pupil away. <span class="t18">{3.46}</span></p>
<p class="p7">But the youth thought, <span class="t18">[3.31]</span> &ldquo;I will have no part in this matter,&rdquo; and he went and found the Bodhisatta in the king&rsquo;s garden. After saluting him in a friendly manner he took a seat at a respectful distance. The Bodhisatta asked him saying: &ldquo;Young man, does the king rule his kingdom righteously?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, venerable sir, he does,&rdquo; answered the youth, &ldquo;but he has heard four cries in the night, and on inquiring of the brahmins, he has been assured by them that they would restore his peace of mind, by offering up the fourfold sacrifice. So the king, being anxious to recover his happiness, is preparing a sacrifice of animals, and a vast number of victims has been brought up and fastened to the sacrificial stakes. Now is it not right for holy men like yourself to explain the cause of these noises, and to rescue these numerous victims from the jaws of death?&rdquo; &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the king does not know us, nor do we know the king, but we do know the origin of these cries, and if the king were to come and ask us the cause, we would resolve his doubts for him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;just stay here a moment, venerable sir, and I will conduct the king to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8327"></a>The Bodhisatta agreed, and the youth went and told the king all about it, and brought him back with him. The king saluted the Bodhisatta and sitting on one side asked him if it were true that he knew the origin of these noises. &ldquo;Yes, your majesty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then tell me, venerable sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;these men in a former existence were guilty of gross misconduct with the carefully guarded wives of their neighbours near Benares, and therefore were reborn in Four Iron Cauldrons. Where after being tortured for thirty thousand years in a thick corrosive liquid heated to boiling point, they would at one time sink till they struck the bottom of the cauldron, and at another time rise to the top like a foam bubble,<a id="a8328"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15458"><span class="t9">{582}</span></a> but after those years they found the mouth of the cauldron, and looking over the edge they all four desired to give utterance to four complete verses, but failed to do so. And after getting out just one syllable each, they sank again in the iron cauldrons. <span class="t18">{3.47}</span> Now the one of them that sank after uttering the syllable <span class="t11">&ldquo;du&rdquo;</span> was anxious to speak as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Due share of wealth we gave not; an evil life we led:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We found no sure safe island in joys that now are fled.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And when he failed to utter it, the Bodhisatta of his own knowledge repeated the complete verse. And similarly with the rest. The one that uttered merely the syllable <span class="t11">&ldquo;sa&rdquo;</span> wanted to repeat the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Sad fate of those that suffer! Ah! When shall come release?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8329"></a><span class="t12">Still after countless aeons, hell&rsquo;s tortures never cease.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.32]</span></p>
<p class="p6">And again in the case of the one that uttered the syllable <span class="t11">&ldquo;na,&rdquo;</span> this was the verse he wished to repeat:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Nay endless are the sufferings to which we&rsquo;re doomed by fate;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The ills we wrought upon the earth &rsquo;tis ours to expiate.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And the one that uttered the syllable <span class="t11">&ldquo;so&rdquo;</span> was anxious to repeat the following:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Soon shall I passing forth from hence, attain to human birth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And richly dowered with virtue rise to many a deed of worth.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.48}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta, after reciting these verses one by one, said: &ldquo;The dweller in hell, sire, when he wanted to utter a complete verse, through the greatness of his wrong doing, was unable to do it. And when he thus experienced the result of his wrong doing he cried aloud. But fear not; no danger shall come nigh to you, in consequence of hearing this cry.&rdquo; Thus did he reassure the king. And the king proclaimed by beat of his golden drum that the vast host of victims was to be released, and the sacrificial pit destroyed. And the Bodhisatta, after thus providing for the safety of the numerous victims, stayed there a few days, and then returning to the same place, without any break in his Absorption, was reborn in the Brahmā Realm.</p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a8336"></a><span class="t15">Alternative Title: Sabbamaṁsalābhajātaka (Cst)</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present when some monks are ill Ven. Sāriputta manages to get some good food for them and they recover. The Buddha tells a story of how four youths had spoken successively in dearer terms to a hunter and had received due rewards accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a8337"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the wealthy man&rsquo;s son who received all the meat (sabbamaṁsalābhī seṭṭhiputto),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;For one who is asking.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This was a story told by the Teacher, while living at Jetavana, as to how the elder Sāriputta procured dainty fare for some sick monks under medical treatment. The story goes that certain of the monks at that time at Jetavana, after taking oil as a purgative, wished for some dainty food. Those who ministered to them in their sickness went into Sāvatthi to fetch some dainties, but after going their round for alms in a street in the cooks&rsquo; quarters, had to come back without getting what they wanted. Later on in the day the elder was going into the town for alms and meeting these monks asked them why they had returned so soon. They told him </span><span class="t18">[3.33] </span><span class="t30">what had happened. &ldquo;Come then with me,&rdquo; said the elder, </span><span class="t18">{3.49}</span><a id="a8339"></a><span class="t30"> and took them to the very same street. And the people there gave him a full measure of dainty fare. The attendants brought the food to the sick monks, and they partook of it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So one day a discussion was started in the Dhamma Hall how that when some servants were leaving a town, without being able to get dainty fare for their sick masters, the elder took them with him on his round for alms in a street in the cooks&rsquo; quarters, and sent them home with abundant dainties. The Teacher came up and inquired the nature of their discussion, and on being told what it was he said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, did Sāriputta alone obtain food. Formerly also wise men who had a soft voice and knew how to speak pleasantly obtained the same.&rdquo; And then he told a tale of the olden time.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as the son of a wealthy merchant.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day a certain deer-stalker had taken venison, and filling his cart with the meat, returned to the city with the intention of selling it. At this time four sons of rich merchants who were living in Benares sallied out of the city, and meeting at some cross roads they sat down and conversed with one another about whatever they had seen or heard. One of these youths on seeing the cart full of meat proposed to go and get a piece of venison from the hunter. The others bade him go and try. So he went up to the hunter, and said: &ldquo;Hi, sir, give me a piece of meat.&rdquo; The hunter replied, &ldquo;A man who begs somewhat from another ought to speak with a gentle voice: you shall receive a piece of meat appropriate to your manner of speech.&rdquo; Then he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;For one who is asking a favour, my friend, your language is coarse in its tone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Such language deserves coarse fare in return, so I offer you mere skin and bone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then one of his companions asked him what language he had used in begging for a piece of meat. &ldquo;I said, Hi, sir!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I too,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;will beg of him.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.50}</span> Then he went to the hunter and said: &ldquo;O elder brother, give me a piece of venison.&rdquo; The hunter answered, &ldquo;You shall receive such a piece as the words you have spoken deserve,&rdquo; and he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;The name of a brother a strong link is found, to join those akin to each other,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As your kind words suggest the gift I should make, so a joint I present to my brother.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And with these words he took up and threw him a joint of venison. Then a third youth inquired with what words the last had begged for the meat. &ldquo;I addressed him as brother,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Then I too will beg of him,&rdquo; he said. So he went to the hunter and cried, &ldquo;Dear father, give me a piece of venison.&rdquo; The hunter replied, &ldquo;You shall receive a <span class="t18">[3.34] </span>piece suitable to the words you have spoken,&rdquo; and he repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;As a parent&rsquo;s fond heart to pity is moved, the cry of &ldquo;Dear father&rdquo; to hear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So I too respond to your loving appeal, and give you the heart of the deer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And with these words he picked up and gave him a savoury piece of meat, heart and all. Then the fourth of the youths asked the third youth, with what words he had asked for the venison. &ldquo;Oh I called him &lsquo;Dear father,&rsquo; &rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Then I too will beg a piece,&rdquo; said the other, and he went to the hunter and said: &ldquo;My friend, give me a piece of meat.&rdquo; Said the hunter, &ldquo;According to the words you have spoken, shall you receive.&rdquo; And he repeated the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;A world without friends, I venture to think, a wilderness surely must be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In that title of friend all that&rsquo;s dear is implied, so I give all the deer unto you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Moreover he said: &ldquo;Come, friend, I will convey all this cartful of meat to your house.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.51}</span> So this merchant&rsquo;s son had the cart driven to his house, and he went and unloaded the meat. And he treated the hunter with great hospitality and respect, and sending for his wife and son he took him away from his cruel occupation, and settled him on his own estate. And they became inseparable friends, and all their life long lived amicably together.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Sāriputta was the Hunter, and I myself was the merchant&rsquo;s son who had all the venison given to him.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Seven red fish.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while living at Jetavana, about a gift of all the Buddhist requisites. A certain landowner at Sāvatthi, they say, provided all the requisites for the Saṅgha with Buddha at its head, and setting up a pavilion at his house door, he invited all the </span><span class="t18">[3.35] </span><span class="t30">company of monastics with Buddha as their chief, seated them on elegant seats prepared for them, and offered them a variety of choice and dainty food. And saying: &ldquo;Come again tomorrow,&rdquo; he entertained them for a whole week, and on the seventh day he presented Buddha and the five hundred monastics under him with all the requisites. At the end of the feast the Teacher, in returning thanks, said: &ldquo;Lay brother, you are right in giving pleasure and satisfaction by this generosity. For this is a tradition of wise men of old, who sacrificed their lives for any beggars they met with, and gave them even their own flesh to eat.&rdquo; And at the request of his host he related this old world legend.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a young hare and lived in a wood. On one side of this wood was the foot of a mountain, on another side a river, and on the third side a border-village. The hare had three friends &ndash; a monkey, a jackal and an otter. These four wise creatures lived together <span class="t18">{3.52}</span> and each of them got his food on his own hunting-ground, and in the evening they again came together. The hare in his wisdom by way of admonition preached the Dhamma to his three companions, teaching that alms are to be given, the moral law to be observed, and the fast days to be kept. They accepted his admonition and went each to his own part of the jungle and dwelt there.</p>
<p class="p7">And so in the course of time the Bodhisatta one day observing the sky, and looking at the moon knew that the next day would be the Uposatha, and addressing his three companions he said: &ldquo;Tomorrow is the Uposatha. Let all three of you take upon you the moral precepts, and observe the holy day. To one that stands fast in moral practice, generosity brings a great reward. Therefore feed any beggars that come to you by giving them food from your own table.&rdquo; They readily agreed, and each returned to his own place of dwelling.</p>
<p class="p7">On the morrow quite early in the morning, the otter sallied forth to seek his prey and went down to the bank of the Ganges. Now it came to pass that a fisherman had landed seven red fish, and stringing them together on a line, he had taken and buried them in the sand on the river&rsquo;s bank. And then he dropped down the stream, catching more fish. The otter scenting the buried fish, dug up the sand till he came upon them, and pulling them out cried aloud thrice, &ldquo;Does any one own these fish?&rdquo; And not seeing any owner he took hold of the line with his teeth and laid the fish in the jungle where he dwelt, intending to eat them at a fitting time. And then he lay down, thinking how virtuous he was! The jackal too sallied forth in quest of food and found in the hut of a field-watcher two spits, a lizard and a pot of milk-curd. And after thrice crying aloud, &ldquo;To whom do these belong?&rdquo; and not finding an owner, he put on his neck the rope for lifting the pot, and grasping the spits and the <span class="t18">[3.36] </span>lizard with his teeth, he brought and laid them in his own lair, thinking: &ldquo;In due season I will devour them,&rdquo; and so lay down, <span class="t18">{3.53}</span> reflecting how virtuous he had been.</p>
<p class="p7">The monkey also entered the clump of trees, and gathering a bunch of mangoes laid them up in his part of the jungle, meaning to eat them in due season, and then lay down, thinking how virtuous he was.</p>
<p class="p7">But the Bodhisatta in due time came out, intending to graze on the kusa grass, and as he lay in the jungle, the thought occurred to him, &ldquo;It is impossible for me to offer grass to any beggars that may chance to appear, and I have no oil or rice and such like. If any beggar shall appeal to me, I shall have to give him my own flesh to eat.&rdquo; At this splendid display of virtue, Sakka&rsquo;s white marble throne manifested signs of heat. Sakka on reflection discovered the cause and resolved to put this royal hare to the test. First of all he went and stood by the otter&rsquo;s dwelling-place, disguised as a brahmin, and being asked why he stood there, he replied, &ldquo;Wise sir, if I could get something to eat, after keeping the fast, I would perform all my monastic duties.&rdquo; The otter replied, &ldquo;Very well, I will give you some food,&rdquo; and as he conversed with him he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Seven red fish I safely brought to land from Ganges flood,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O brahmin, eat your fill, I pray, and stay within this wood.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The brahmin said: &ldquo;Let be till tomorrow. I will see to it by and by.&rdquo; Next he went to the jackal, and when asked by him why he stood there, he made the same answer. The jackal, too, readily promised him some food, and in talking with him repeated the second verse: <span class="t18">{3.54}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;A lizard and a jar of curds, the keeper&rsquo;s evening meal,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Two spits to roast the flesh withal I wrongfully did steal:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Such as I have I give to you: O brahmin, eat, I pray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you should deign within this wood a while with us to stay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Said the brahmin, &ldquo;Let be till tomorrow. I will see to it by and by.&rdquo; Then he went to the monkey, and when asked what he meant by standing there, he answered just as before. The monkey readily offered him some food, and in conversing with him gave utterance to the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;An icy stream, a mango ripe, and pleasant greenwood shade,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis thine to enjoy, if you can dwell content in forest glade.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Said the brahmin, &ldquo;Let be till tomorrow. I will see to it by and by.&rdquo; And he went to the wise hare, and on being asked by him why he stood there, he made the same reply. The Bodhisatta on hearing what he wanted was highly delighted, and said: &ldquo;Brahmin, you have done well in coming to me for food. This day will I grant you a boon that I have never granted before, but you shall not break the moral law by taking <span class="t18">[3.37] </span>animal life. Go, friend, and when you have piled together logs of wood, and kindled a fire, come and let me know, <span class="t18">{3.55}</span> and I will sacrifice myself by falling into the midst of the flames, and when my body is roasted, you shall eat my flesh and fulfil all your monastic duties.&rdquo; And in thus addressing him the hare uttered the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Nor sesame, nor beans, nor rice have I as food to give,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But roast with fire my flesh I yield, if you with us would live.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka, on hearing what he said, by his miraculous power caused a heap of burning coals to appear, and came and told the Bodhisatta. Rising from his bed of kusa grass and coming to the place, he thrice shook himself that if there were any insects within his coat, they might escape death. Then offering his whole body as a free gift he sprang up, and like a royal swan, alighting on a cluster of lotuses, joyfully he fell on the heap of live coals. But the flame failed even to heat the pores of the hair on the body of the Bodhisatta, and it was as if he had entered a region of frost.</p>
<p class="p7">Then he addressed Sakka in these words, &ldquo;Brahmin, the fire you have kindled is icy-cold: it fails to heat even the pores of the hair on my body. What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Wise sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am no brahmin. I am Sakka, and I have come to put your virtue to the test.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;If not only you, Sakka, but all the inhabitants of the world were to try me in this matter of generosity, they would not find in me any unwillingness to give,&rdquo; and with this the Bodhisatta uttered a cry of exultation like a lion roaring. Then said Sakka to the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;O wise hare, be your virtue known throughout a whole aeon.&rdquo; And squeezing the mountain, with the essence thus extracted, he daubed the sign of a hare on the orb of the moon. And after depositing the hare on a bed of young kusa grass, in the same wooded part of the jungle, Sakka returned to his own place in heaven. <span class="t18">{3.56}</span> And these four wise creatures dwelt happily and harmoniously together, fulfilling the moral law and observing the fast days, till they departed to fare according to their deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, when he had ended his lesson, revealed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the householder, who gave as a free-gift all the Buddhist requisites, attained fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the otter, Moggallāna was the jackal, Sāriputta the monkey, and I myself was the wise hare.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Weep for the living.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.38] </span><span class="t30">The Teacher while in residence at Jetavana told this story of a certain landowner who dwelt at Sāvatthi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On the death of his brother, it is said, he was so overwhelmed with grief that he neither ate nor washed nor anointed himself, but in deep affliction he used to go to the cemetery at daybreak to weep. The Teacher, early in the morning casting his eye upon the world and observing in that man a capacity for attaining to the fruition of the First Path, thought: &ldquo;There is no one but myself that can, by telling him what happened long ago, assuage his grief and bring him to the fruition of the First Path. I must be his refuge.&rdquo; So next day on returning in the afternoon from his alms round, he took a junior monk and went to his house. On hearing of the Teacher&rsquo;s arrival, the landowner ordered a seat to be prepared and bade him enter, and saluting him he sat on one side. In answer to the Teacher, who asked him why he was grieving, he said he had been sorrowing ever since his brother&rsquo;s death. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;All compound existences are impermanent, and what is to be broken will be broken. One ought not to make a trouble of this. Wise men of old, from knowing this, did not grieve, when their brother died.&rdquo; And at his request the Teacher related this legend of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was reborn in the family of a rich merchant, worth eighty crores. When he was come of age, his parents died. And on their death a brother of the Bodhisatta managed the family estate. <span class="t18">{3.57}</span> And the Bodhisatta lived in dependence on him. By and by the brother also died of a fatal disease. His relations, friends and companions came together, and throwing up their arms wept and lamented, and no one was able to control his feelings. But the Bodhisatta neither lamented nor wept. Men said: &ldquo;See now, though his brother is dead, he does not so much as pull a wry face: he is a very hard-hearted fellow. I think he desired his brother&rsquo;s death, hoping to enjoy a double portion.&rdquo; Thus did they blame the Bodhisatta. His kinsfolk too reproved him, saying: &ldquo;Though your brother is dead, you do not shed a tear.&rdquo; On hearing their words he said: &ldquo;In your blind folly, not knowing the Eight Worldly Conditions, you weep and cry, &ldquo;Alas, my brother is dead,&rdquo; but I too, and you also, will have to die. Why then do you not weep at the thought of your own death? All existing things are transient, and consequently no single compound is able to remain in its natural condition. Though you, blind fools, in your state of ignorance, from not knowing the Eight Worldly <span class="t18">[3.39] </span>Conditions, weep and lament, why should I weep?&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Weep for the living rather than the dead!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All creatures that a mortal form do take,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Four-footed beast and bird and hooded snake,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Midst sad vicissitude of bliss and pain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why shedding idle tears should man complain,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo; &rsquo;Twas the joyous time.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8364"></a><span class="t30"> This was a story told by the Teacher at Jetavana, about a monk who was tempted by thoughts of the wife he had left. The circumstances that led up to the story will be set forth in the Indriyajātaka [Ja 423].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The story is that a young man of good family at Sāvatthi heard the Teacher&rsquo;s preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymen&rsquo;s houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. He took what he had got to the wife he had left: she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. &ldquo;Salute him and bid him pass on.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8365"></a><span class="t34">But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, &ldquo;This is the father of my sons.&rdquo; She came out and saluted him: taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food: when he had eaten she saluted again and said: &ldquo;Sir, you are a saint now: we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householder&rsquo;s life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country: be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.&rdquo; For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: &ldquo;I cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life; send a layman&rsquo;s garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.&rdquo; She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Against his will they took him to the Teacher and told him that he was discontent and wished to go back to worldly life. The Teacher said: &ldquo;Is this tale true?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is, Lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who causes you to fall back?&rdquo; &ldquo;My wife.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, addressing this monk, said: &ldquo;Once before, through her, you had your head cut off.&rdquo; And then he related a legend of the past. </span><span class="t18">{3.59}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a village of Kāsi in the home of a certain householder, under the star of a robber. When he grew up to be a man, he <span class="t18">[3.40] </span><a id="a8366"></a>gained his living by robbery, and his fame was blazed abroad in the world, as a bold fellow and as strong as an elephant. And no man could catch him. One day he broke into a rich merchant&rsquo;s house and carried off much treasure. The townsfolk came to the king and said: &ldquo;Sire, a mighty robber is plundering the city: have him arrested.&rdquo; The king ordered the governor of the city to seize him. So in the night the governor posted men here and there in detachments, and having effected his capture with the money upon him, he reported it to the king. The king bade the governor cut off his head. Then the governor had his arms tightly bound behind him, and having tied a wreath of red oleander flowers about his neck and sprinkled brickdust on his head, had him scourged with whips in every square, and then led to the place of execution to the music of the harsh-sounding drum. Men said: &ldquo;This rapacious robber who loots our city is taken,&rdquo; and the whole city was greatly moved.</p>
<p class="p7">At this time there lived in Benares a courtesan named Sāmā, whose price was a thousand pieces of money. She was a favourite of the king&rsquo;s, and had a suite of five hundred female slaves. And as she stood at an open window on the upper floor of the palace, she saw this robber being led along. Now he was comely and gracious to look upon, and stood forth above all men, exceedingly glorious and god-like in appearance. And when she saw him being thus led past, she fell in love with him and thought within herself, &ldquo;By what device can I secure this man for my husband? &ldquo;This is the way,&rdquo; she said, and sent by the hand of one of her female attendants a thousand pieces of money to the governor and, &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this robber is Sāmā&rsquo;s brother, and he has no other refuge except in Sāmā. And ask him to accept the money and let his prisoner escape.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.60}</span> The handmaid did as she was told. But the governor said: &ldquo;This is a notorious robber, I cannot let him go free after this sort. But if I could find another man as a substitute, I could put the robber in a covered carriage and send him to you.&rdquo; The slave came and reported this to her mistress.</p>
<p class="p7">Now at this time a certain rich young merchant, who was enamoured of Sāmā, presented her every day with a thousand pieces of money. And that very day at sunset her lover came as usual to her house with the money. And Sāmā took the money and placed it in her lap and sat weeping. And when she was asked what was the cause of her sorrow, she said: &ldquo;My lord, this robber is my brother, though he never came to see me, because people say I follow a vile trade: when I sent a message to the governor he sent word that if he were to receive a thousand pieces of money, he would let his prisoner go free. And now I cannot find any one to go and take this money to the governor.&rdquo; The youth for the love he bare her said: &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go, then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and take with you the money you brought me.&rdquo; So he took it and went to the house of the governor.<span class="t18"> [3.41]</span></p>
<p class="p7">The governor hid the young merchant in a secret place, and had the robber conveyed in a closed carriage to Sāmā. Then he thought: &ldquo;This robber is well known in the country. It must be quite dark first. And then, when all men are retired to rest, I will have the man executed.&rdquo; And so making some excuse for delaying it a while, when people had retired to rest, he sent the young merchant with a large escort to the place of execution, and cutting off his head with a sword impaled his body, and returned into the city.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8367"></a>Thenceforth Sāmā accepted nought at any other man&rsquo;s hand, but passed all her time, taking her pleasure with this robber only. The thought occurred to the robber, &ldquo;If this woman should fall in love with any one else, she will have me put to death too, and take her pleasure with him. She is very treacherous to her friends. I must no longer dwell here, but make haste to escape.&rdquo; When he was going away, <span class="t18">{3.61}</span> he thought: &ldquo;I will not go empty-handed, but will take some of the ornaments belonging to her.&rdquo; So one day he said to her, &ldquo;My dear, we always stay indoors like tame cockatoos in a cage. Some day we will disport ourselves in the garden.&rdquo; She readily assented and prepared every kind of food, hard and soft, and decked herself out with all her ornaments, and drove to the garden with him seated in a closed carriage. While he was disporting himself with her, he thought: &ldquo;Now must be the time for me to escape.&rdquo; So under a show of violent affection for her, he entered into a thicket of oleander bushes, and pretending to embrace her, he squeezed her till she became insensible. Then throwing her down he robbed her of all her ornaments, and fastening them in her outer garment he placed the bundle on his shoulder, and leaping over the garden wall made off.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8368"></a>And when she had recovered consciousness, rising up she went and asked her attendants, what had become of her young lord. &ldquo;We do not know, lady.&rdquo; &ldquo;He thinks,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;I am dead, and must in his alarm have run away.&rdquo; And being distressed at the thought, she returned thence to her house, and said: &ldquo;Not till I have set eyes on my dear lord, will I rest upon a sumptuous couch,&rdquo; and she lay down upon the ground. And from that day she neither put on comely garments, nor ate more than one meal, nor affected scents and wreaths and the like. And being resolved to seek and recover her lover by every possible means, she sent for some actors and gave them a thousand pieces of money. On their asking, &ldquo;What are we to do for this, lady?&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;There is no place that you do not visit. Go then to every village, town and city, and gathering a crowd around you, first of all sing this song in the midst of the people,&rdquo; teaching the actors the first verse. &ldquo;And if,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;when you have sung this song, my husband shall be one of the crowd, he will speak to you. <span class="t18">{3.62}</span> Then you may tell him I am quite well, and bring him back with you. And should he refuse to come, send me a message.&rdquo;<span class="t18"> [3.42]</span></p>
<p class="p7">And giving them their expenses for the journey, she sent them off. They started from Benares, and calling the people together here and there, at last arrived at a border-village. Now the robber, since his flight, was living here. And the actors gathered a crowd about them, and sang the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo; &rsquo;Twas the joyous time of spring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bright with flowers each shrub and tree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From her swoon awakening</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sāmā lives, and lives for thee.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The robber on hearing this drew near to the actor, and said: &ldquo;You say that Sāmā is alive, but I do not believe it.&rdquo; And addressing him he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Can fierce winds a mountain shake?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Can they make firm earth to quake?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But alive the dead to see</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Marvel stranger far would be!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.63}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The actor on hearing these words uttered the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Sāmā surely is not dead,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor another lord would wed.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fasting from all meals but one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She loves you and you alone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The robber on hearing this said: &ldquo;Whether she be alive or dead, I don&rsquo;t want her,&rdquo; and with these words he repeated the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Sāmā&rsquo;s fancy ever roves</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From tried faith to lighter loves:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Me too Sāmā would betray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Were I not to flee away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The actors came and told Sāmā how he had dealt with them. And she, full of regrets, took once more to her old course of life.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, when his lesson was ended, revealed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the worldly-minded monk attained to fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time this monk was the rich merchant&rsquo;s son, the wife he had left was Sāmā, and I myself was the robber.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the Buddha&rsquo;s son Rāhula is so keen to keep the rules he even sleeps in the outhouse at night. The Buddha commends his good qualities and tells a story of a partridge that had scruples when used by a hunter as a decoy to attract his prey, and the wise man who consoled him.</span></p>

The introductory story has already been related in full in the Tipallatthajātaka [Ja 16].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8378"></a><span class="t34">Once when the Teacher was dwelling in the Aggāḷava Temple nearby the town of Āḷavi, many female lay-disciples and nuns used to flock there to hear the Dhamma preached. The preaching was in the daytime, but as time wore on, the women did not attend, and there were only monks and men disciples present. Then the preaching took place in the evening; and at the close the elder monks retired each to his own chamber. But the younger ones with the lay-disciples lay down to rest in the Attendance Hall. When they fell asleep, loud was the snoring and snorting and gnashing of teeth as they lay. After a short slumber some got up, and reported to the Fortunate One the impropriety which they had witnessed. Said he, &ldquo;If a monk sleeps in the company of novices, it is a Pācittiya offence (requiring confession).&rdquo; And after delivering this precept he went away to Kosambī.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Thereon the monks said to the venerable Rāhula, &ldquo;Sir, the Fortunate One has laid down this precept, and now you will please find quarters of your own.&rdquo; Now, before this, the monks, out of respect for the father and because of the anxious desire of the son to observe the rules of the Saṅgha, had welcomed the youth as if the place were his; they had fitted up a little bed for him, and had given him a cloth to make a pillow with. But on the day of our story they would not even give him house-room, so fearful were they of transgressing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8379"></a><a id="a8380"></a><span class="t34">The excellent Rāhula went neither to the One with Ten Powers as being his father, nor to Sāriputta, Captain of the Dhamma, as being his preceptor, nor to the Great Moggallāna as being his teacher, nor to the elder Ānanda as being his uncle; but betook himself to the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; outhouse and took up his abode there as though in a heavenly mansion. Now in the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; outhouse the door is always closely shut: the levelled floor is of perfumed earth; flowers and garlands are festooned round the walls; and all night long a lamp burns there. But it was not this splendour which prompted Rāhula to take up his residence here. Nay, it was simply because the monks had told him to find quarters for himself, and because he reverenced instruction and yearned to observe the rules of the Saṅgha. Indeed, from time to time the monks, to test him, when they saw him coming from quite a distance, used to throw down a hand-broom or a little dust-sweepings, and then ask who had thrown it down, after Rāhula had come in. &ldquo;Well, Rāhula came that way,&rdquo; would be the remark, but never did the future elder say he knew nothing about it. On the contrary, he used to remove the litter and humbly ask pardon of the monk, nor go away till he was assured that he was pardoned; so anxious was he to observe the rules. And it was solely this anxiety which made him take up his dwelling in the outhouse.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now, though day had not yet dawned, the Teacher halted at the door of the outhouse and coughed &ldquo;Ahem.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ahem,&rdquo; responded the venerable Rāhula. &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; said the Buddha. &ldquo;It is I, Rāhula,&rdquo; was the reply; and out came the young man and bowed low. &ldquo;Why have you been sleeping here, Rāhula?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because I had nowhere to go to. Up till now, sir, the monks have been very kind to me; but such is their present fear of erring that they won&rsquo;t give me shelter any more. Consequently, I took up my abode here, because I thought it a spot where I should not come into contact with anybody else.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then thought the Teacher to himself, &ldquo;If they treat even Rāhula like this, what will they not do to other youths whom they admit to the Saṅgha?&rdquo; And his heart was moved within him for the Dhamma. So, at an early hour he had the monks assembled, and questioned the Captain of the Dhamma thus, &ldquo;I suppose you at all events, Sāriputta, know where Rāhula is now quartered?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;No, sir, I do not.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8381"></a><span class="t34">&ldquo;Sāriputta, Rāhula was living this day in the outhouse. Sāriputta, if you treat Rāhula like this, what will be your treatment of other youths who go forth in this dispensation? Such treatment will not retain those who join us. In future, keep your novices in your own quarters for a day or two, and only on the third day let them lodge out, taking care to acquaint yourself with their lodging.&rdquo; With this rider, the Teacher laid down the precept.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now when the monks in the Dhamma Hall were setting forth the praises of the venerable Rāhula, and speaking of him as fond of instruction, scrupulous and patient of rebuke, the Teacher came up and on hearing from them the subject of their discourse said: &ldquo;Not only now, but formerly also Rāhula possessed all these virtues.&rdquo; And then he told them a legend of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family. And when he grew up, he studied all the arts at Taxila, and giving up the world devoted himself to the ascetic life in the Himālayas, and developed the Super Knowledges and Attainments. There enjoying the pleasures of Absorption he dwelt in a pleasant grove, whence he journeyed to a frontier village to procure salt and vinegar. The people, on seeing him, became believers, and built him a hut of leaves in a wood, and providing him with all that he required, made a home for him there.</p>
<p class="p7">At this time a fowler in this village had caught a decoy partridge, and putting it in a cage carefully trained and looked after it. Then he took it to the wood, and by its cry decoyed all the other partridges that came near. The partridge thought: &ldquo;Through me many of my kinsfolk come by their death. This is a wicked act on my part.&rdquo; So it kept quiet. When its master found it was quiet, he struck it on the head with a piece of bamboo. The partridge from the pain it suffered uttered a cry. And the fowler gained a living by decoying other partridges through it. Then the partridge thought: &ldquo;Well, suppose they die. There is no evil intention on my part. Do the evil consequences of my action affect me? When I am quiet, they do not come, but when I utter a cry, they do. And all that come this fellow catches and puts to death. Is there any sinful act here on my part, or is there not?&rdquo; Thenceforth the only thought of the partridge is, &ldquo;Who verily may resolve my doubt?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.65}</span><a id="a8382"></a> and it went about seeking for such a wise man. Now one day the fowler snared a lot of partridges, and filling his basket with them he came to the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s hermitage to beg a draught of water. And putting down the cage near the Bodhisatta, he drank some water and lay down on the sand and fell <span class="t18">[3.44] </span>asleep. The partridge observing that he was asleep thought: &ldquo;I will ask this ascetic as to my doubt, and if he knows he will solve my difficulty.&rdquo; And as it lay in its cage, it repeated the first verse in the form of a question:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Happy life I lead all day,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Food abundant falls to me:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet I&rsquo;m in a parlous way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What&rsquo;s my future state to be?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta solving this question uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;If no evil in your heart</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Prompts to deed of villainy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should you play a passive part,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Guilt attaches not to you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The partridge on hearing this uttered the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Lo! Our kinsman: thus they cry,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And in crowds they flock to see.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Am I guilty, should they die?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Please resolve this doubt for me.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.66}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, the Bodhisatta repeated the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;If no wrong lurks in the heart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Innocent the deed will be.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He who plays a passive part</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From all guilt is counted free.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being console the partridge. And through him the bird was freed from remorse. Then the fowler waking up saluted the Bodhisatta and took up his cage and made off.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Rāhula was the partridge, and I myself was the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a8388"></a><span class="t15">In the present when a landowner is returning to town with his wife she asks him if he would give her anything from a mountain of gold, and he replies he would not. The Buddha tells a story of a prince in exile who said the same thing to his wife, but when he was able to, he gave her dominion over all.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;He might give.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8390"></a><a id="a8391"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher, while residing at Jetavana, with regard to a certain landowner. According to the story he went to a village with his wife to retrieve a debt, and seizing a cart in satisfaction for what was due to him he deposited it with a certain family, intending to fetch it </span><span class="t18">[3.45] </span><a id="a8392"></a><span class="t30">later on. While on the road to Sāvatthi, they came in sight of a mountain. The wife asked him, &ldquo;Suppose this mountain were to become all gold, would you give me some of it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I would not give you a jot.&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;he is a hard-hearted man. Though the mountain should become pure gold, he would not give me an atom.&rdquo; And she was highly displeased.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When they drew near to Jetavana, feeling thirsty, they went into the monastery, and had some water to drink. </span><span class="t18">{3.67}</span><a id="a8393"></a><span class="t30"> At daybreak the Teacher seeing in them a capacity for emancipation, sat in a cell of his Perfumed Chamber, looking out for their arrival, and emitted the six-coloured Buddha rays. And after they had quenched their thirst, they came to the Teacher and respectfully saluting him sat down. The Teacher, after the usual kindly greetings, asked them where they had been. &ldquo;We have been, venerable sir, to call in a debt.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lay sister,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I hope your husband is anxious for your good and ready to do you a kindness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Venerable sir,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I am very affectionate to him, but he has no love for me. Today when I asked him, on catching sight of a mountain, &lsquo;Supposing it were all pure gold, would you give me some?&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;Who are you? I would not give you a jot.&rsquo; So hard-hearted is he.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lay sister,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;he talks like this. But whenever he calls to mind your virtues he is ready to give you lordship over all.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell us about it, your reverence,&rdquo; they cried, and at their request he related this legend of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was his minister, rendering him all due service. One day the king saw his son, who acted as his viceroy, coming to pay his respects to him. He thought to himself, &ldquo;This fellow may do me wrong, if he gets an opportunity.&rdquo; So he sent for him and said: &ldquo;As long as I live, you cannot dwell in this city. Live somewhere else, and at my death rule the kingdom.&rdquo; He agreed to these conditions, and bidding his father farewell he started from Benares with his chief wife. On coming to a frontier village, he built himself a hut of leaves in a wood, and stayed there, supporting life on wild roots and fruit.</p>
<p class="p7">By and by the king died. The young viceroy, from his observation of the stars, knew of his father&rsquo;s death, and as he journeyed to Benares, a mountain came into sight. His wife said to him, &ldquo;Supposing, sir, yonder mountain were turned into pure gold, would you give me some of it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I would not give you an atom.&rdquo; She thought: &ldquo;Through my love for him I entered this forest, not having the heart to desert him, and he speaks to me thus. <span class="t18">{3.68}</span> He is very hard-hearted, and if he becomes king, what good will he do me?&rdquo; And she was sore at heart.</p>
<p class="p7">On reaching Benares he was established on the throne and raised her to the dignity of chief queen. He merely gave her titular rank, but beyond this he paid her no respect or honour, and did not even recognize her existence. Thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;This queen was helpmate to the king, not counting the pain, and dwelt with him in the wilderness. But he, taking no count of this, goes about, taking his pleasure with other women. But I will bring it about that she shall receive lordship over <span class="t18">[3.46] </span>all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8394"></a>With this thought he went one day and saluting her said: &ldquo;Lady, we do not receive from you so much as a lump of rice. Why are you so hard-hearted, and why do you thus neglect us?&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;if I myself were to receive anything, I would give it you, but if I get nothing, what am I to give? What, pray, is the king likely to give me? On the road here, when asked, &lsquo;If yonder mountain were all pure gold, would you give me anything?&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;Who are you? I would give you nothing.&rsquo; &rdquo; &ldquo;Well, could you repeat all this before the king?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why should I not, friend?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Then when I stand in the king&rsquo;s presence,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I will ask and you shall repeat it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Agreed, friend,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="p7">So the Bodhisatta, when he stood and paid his respects to the king, asked the queen, saying: &ldquo;Are we not, lady, to receive anything at your hands?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;when I get anything, I will give you something. But, pray, what is the king likely to give me now? When we were coming from the forest, and a mountain came into sight, I asked him, &lsquo;If yonder mountain were all pure gold, would you give me some of it?&rsquo; &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I will give you nothing.&rsquo; And in these words he refused what it was easy to give.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.69}</span> To illustrate this, she repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;He might give at little cost</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What he would not miss, if lost.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Golden mountains I bestow;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He to all I ask says &lsquo;No.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king on hearing this uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;When you can, say, &lsquo;Yes, I will,&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When you cannot, promise nil.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Broken promises are lies;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Liars all wise men despise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The queen, when she heard this, raising her joined hands in respectful salutation, repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Standing fast in righteousness,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You, O prince, we humbly bless.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fortune may all else destroy;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Truth is still your only joy.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.70}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta, after hearing the queen sing the praises of the king, set forth her virtues and repeated the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Known to fame as peerless wife,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sharing weal and woe of life,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Equal she to either fate,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fit with even kings to mate.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta in these words sang the praises of the queen, saying: &ldquo;This lady, your majesty, in the time of your adversity, lived with you <span class="t18">[3.47] </span>and shared your sorrows in the forest. You ought to do her honour.&rdquo; The king, at his words, called to mind the queen&rsquo;s virtues and said: &ldquo;Wise sir, at your words I am reminded of the queen&rsquo;s virtues,&rdquo; and so saying he gave all power into her hand. Moreover he bestowed great power upon the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;For it was by you,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I was reminded of the queen&rsquo;s virtues.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, revealed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths, the husband and wife attained to fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time this landowner was the king of Benares, this lay sister was the queen, and I myself was the wise councillor.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one of Ven. Mahākassapa&rsquo;s novices grows angry with his teacher, behaves badly, and eventually burns down his hut, before falling into hell. The Buddha tells a story of a monkey, who, when reproved for his inabilities, destroyed a bird&rsquo;s home.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the horned bird (siṅgilasakuṇa),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the young monk who burned down (Mahākassapa&rsquo;s) hut = the monkey (makkaṭa).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Monkey, in feet.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {3.71}</span><a id="a8401"></a><span class="t30"> This was a story told by the Teacher while dwelling at Jetavana, about a young disciple who burnt down the hut of leaves of the elder Mahākassapa. The incident that led to the story originated in Rājagaha. At that time, they say, the elder was living in a cell in the forest near Rājagaha. Two young novices ministered to his wants. The one of them was serviceable to the elder, the other was ill-behaved. Whatever was done by his comrade, he made as if it were done by himself. For instance, when the other lad had placed water to rinse the mouth, he goes to the elder and saluting him, says, &ldquo;Sir, the water is ready. Please rinse your mouth.&rdquo; And when his companion had risen early and swept out the elder&rsquo;s cell, as soon as the elder appears, he knocks things about here and there, and makes as if the whole cell had been swept out by himself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8402"></a><span class="t30">The dutiful disciple thought: &ldquo;This ill-behaved fellow claims whatever I do just as if he had done it himself. I will expose his cunning behaviour.&rdquo; So when the young rogue had returned from the village and was sleeping after his meal, he heated water for the bath, and hid it in a back room, and then put merely a small quantity of water in the boiler. The other lad on waking went and saw the steam rising up and thought: &ldquo;No doubt our friend has heated the water and put it in the bathroom.&rdquo; So going to the elder he said: &ldquo;Sir, the water is in the bathroom. Please, take your bath.&rdquo; The elder went with him to take a bath, and finding no water in the bathroom asked where the water was. The lad went hastily to the heating chamber and let down a ladle into the empty boiler. The ladle struck against the bottom of the empty vessel, and gave forth a rattling sound. (Thenceforth the boy was known by the name of Uḷuṅkasaddaka [Rattle-Ladle.])</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At this moment the other lad fetched the water from the back room, and said: &ldquo;Sir, please take your bath.&rdquo; The elder had his bath, </span><span class="t18">{3.72}</span><span class="t30"> and being now aware of Uḷuṅka&rsquo;s misconduct, when the boy came in the evening to wait upon him, he reproached him and said: &ldquo;When one that is under monastic vows </span><span class="t18">[3.48] </span><span class="t30">has done a thing himself, then only has he the right to say, &lsquo;I did that.&rsquo; Otherwise it is a deliberate lie. Henceforth be not guilty of conduct like this.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The boy was angry with the elder, and next day refused to go into the town with him to beg for alms. But the other youth accompanied the elder. And Uḷuṅka went to see a family of the elder&rsquo;s retainers. When they inquired where the elder was, he answered that he remained at home ill. They asked what he ought to have. He said: &ldquo;Give me so and so,&rdquo; and took it and went to a place that he fancied, and ate it and returned to the hermitage. Next day the elder visited that family and sat down with them. The people said: &ldquo;You are not well, are you? Yesterday, they say, you stopped at home in your cell. We sent you some food by the hand of such and such a lad. Did your reverence partake of it?&rdquo; The elder held his peace, and when he had finished his meal, returned to the monastery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">In the evening when the boy came to wait upon him, the elder addressed him thus, &ldquo;You went begging, sir, in such and such a family, and in such and such a village. And you begged, saying, &lsquo;The elder must have so and so to eat.&rsquo; And then, they say, you ate it yourself. Such begging is highly improper. See that you are not guilty of such misconduct again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So the boy for ever so long nursed a grudge against the elder, thinking: &ldquo;Yesterday merely on account of a little water he picked a quarrel with me. And now being indignant because of my having eaten a handful of rice in the house of his retainers, he quarrels with me again. I will find out the right way to deal with him.&rdquo; And next day, when the elder had gone into the city for alms, he took a hammer and broke all the vessels used for food, and setting fire to the hut of leaves, took to his heels. While still alive he became a Peta in the world of men, and withered away till he died and was born again in the Great Hell of Avīci. And the fame of his evil deed spread abroad amongst the people.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8403"></a><span class="t30">So one day some monks came from Rājagaha to Sāvatthi, and after putting away their bowls and robes in a convenient place they went and saluting the Teacher sat down. The Teacher conversed pleasantly with them and asked whence they had come. &ldquo;From Rājagaha, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is the teacher that preaches there?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Great Kassapa, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is Kassapa quite well, monks?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Yes, venerable sir, the elder is well. But a youthful member of the fraternity was so angry on account of a reproof he gave him, that he set fire to the elder&rsquo;s hut of leaves, and made off.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.73}</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher, on hearing this, said: &ldquo;Monks, solitude is better for Kassapa than keeping company with a fool like this.&rdquo; And so saying he repeated a verse in the Dhammapada [Dhp. 61]:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&ldquo;To travel with the vulgar herd refuse,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">And fellowship with foolish folk eschew;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Your peer or better for a comrade choose</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Or else in solitude your way pursue.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">Moreover he again addressed the monks and said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, did this youth destroy the hut and feel angry with one that reproved him. In former times too he was angry.&rdquo; And he then told them a legend of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8404"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a young horned bird. And when he grew to be a big bird, he settled in the Himālayas and built him a nest to his fancy, that was proof against the rain. Then a certain monkey in the rainy season, when the rain fell without intermission, sat near the Bodhisatta, his teeth chattering by reason of the severe cold. The Bodhisatta, seeing him thus distressed, fell to talking with him, and uttered the first verse: <span class="t18">[3.49]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Monkey, in feet and hands and face</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So like the human form,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why buildest you no dwelling-place,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To hide you from the storm?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The monkey, on hearing this, replied with a second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;In feet and hands and face, O bird,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though close to man allied,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wisdom, chief boon on him conferred,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To me has been denied.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta, on hearing this, repeated yet two more couplets:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;He that inconstancy betrays, a light and fickle mind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unstable proved in all his ways, no happiness may find. </span><span class="t18">{3.74}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Monkey, in virtue to excel, do you your utmost strive,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And safe from wintry blast to dwell, go, hut of leaves contrive.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thought the monkey, &ldquo;This creature, through dwelling in a place that is sheltered from the rain, despises me. I will not suffer him to rest quietly in this nest.&rdquo; Accordingly, in his eagerness to catch the Bodhisatta, he made a spring upon him. But the Bodhisatta flew up into the air, and winged his way elsewhere. And the monkey, after smashing up and destroying his nest, betook himself off.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the Jātaka. &ldquo;At that time the youth that fired the hut was the monkey, and I myself was the horned bird.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a8413"></a><span class="t15">Alternative Title: Duddubhajātaka (Cst)</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the Buddha is asked about the ascetic practices of the outsiders and declares them of no use for the goal. He then tells a story in which a hare heard a loud noise when a hard fruit fell to earth and thought the world was coming to an end. He ran away scaring all the animals to begin a stampede, until a lion showed him the cause of his fright.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the lion (sīha).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;From the spot where.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher, when he dwelt at Jetavana, about some heretics. These heretics, they say, in various places near Jetavana, made their beds on thorns, suffered the five-fold forms of fire penance, and practised false asceticism of many different kinds. Now a number of the monks, after going their rounds for alms in Sāvatthi, on their way back to Jetavana saw these heretics undergoing their pretended austerities, and came and asked the Teacher, </span><span class="t18">{3.75}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Is there, sir, any virtue in these heterodox monastics in taking upon them these practices?&rdquo; The Teacher said: &ldquo;There is no </span><span class="t18">[3.50] </span><span class="t30">virtue, monks, nor any special merit in it. When it is examined and tested, it is like a path over a dunghill, or like the noise the hare heard.&rdquo; &ldquo;We do not know, sir, what that noise was. Tell us, venerable sir.&rdquo; So at their request he told them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8416"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a young lion. And when fully grown he lived in a wood. At this time there was near the western ocean a grove of palms mixed with wood apple trees. A certain hare lived here beneath a palm sapling, at the foot of a wood apple tree. One day this hare after feeding came and lay down beneath the young palm tree. And the thought struck him, &ldquo;If this earth should be destroyed, what would become of me?&rdquo; And at this very moment a ripe wood apple fruit fell on a palm leaf. At the sound of it, the hare thought: &ldquo;This solid earth is collapsing,&rdquo; and starting up he fled, without so much as looking behind him. Another hare saw him scampering off, as if frightened to death, and asked the cause of his panic flight. &ldquo;Pray, don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; he said. The other hare cried, &ldquo;Pray, sir, what is it?&rdquo; and kept running after him. Then the hare stopped a moment and without looking back said: &ldquo;The earth here is breaking up.&rdquo; And at this the second hare ran after the other. And so first one and then another hare caught sight of him running, and joined in the chase till one hundred thousand hares all took to flight together. They were seen by a deer, a boar, an elk, a buffalo, a wild ox, a rhinoceros, a tiger, a lion and an elephant. And when they asked what it meant and were told that the earth was breaking up, they too took to flight. <span class="t18">{3.76}</span> So by degrees this host of animals extended to the length of a full league.</p>
<p class="p7">When the Bodhisatta saw this headlong flight of the animals, and heard the cause of it was that the earth was coming to an end, he thought: &ldquo;The earth is nowhere coming to an end. Surely it must be some sound which was misunderstood by them. And if I don&rsquo;t make a great effort, they will all perish. I will save their lives.&rdquo; So with the speed of a lion he got before them to the foot of a mountain, and lion-like roared three times. They were terribly frightened at the lion, and stopping in their flight stood all huddled together. The lion went in amongst them and asked why they were running away.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;The earth is collapsing,&rdquo; they answered. &ldquo;Who saw it collapsing?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The elephants know all about it,&rdquo; they replied.</p>
<p class="p7">He asked the elephants. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;the lions know.&rdquo; But the lions said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know, the tigers know.&rdquo; The tigers said: &ldquo;The rhinoceroses know.&rdquo; The rhinoceroses said: &ldquo;The wild oxen know.&rdquo; The wild oxen, &ldquo;The buffaloes.&rdquo; The buffaloes, &ldquo;The elks.&rdquo; The elks, &ldquo;The boars.&rdquo; The boars, &ldquo;The deer.&rdquo; The deer said: &ldquo;We <span class="t18">[3.51] </span>don&rsquo;t know, the hares know.&rdquo; When the hares were questioned, they pointed to one particular hare and said: &ldquo;This one told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So the Bodhisatta asked, &ldquo;Is it true, sir, that the earth is breaking up?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir, I saw it,&rdquo; said the hare. &ldquo;Where,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;were you living, when you saw it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Near the ocean, sir, in a grove of palms mixed with wood apple trees. For as I was lying beneath the shade of a palm sapling at the foot of a wood apple tree, I thought, &lsquo;If this earth should break up, where shall I go?&rsquo; And at that very moment I heard the sound of the breaking up of the earth and I fled.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Thought the lion, &ldquo;A ripe wood apple fruit evidently must have fallen on a palm leaf and made a thudding sound, and this hare jumped to the conclusion that the earth was coming to an end, and ran away. <span class="t18">{3.77}</span> I will find out the exact truth about it.&rdquo; So he reassured the herd of animals, and said: &ldquo;I will take the hare and go and find out exactly whether the earth is coming to an end or not, in the place pointed out by him. Until I return, do you stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then placing the hare on his back, he sprang forward with the speed of a lion, and putting the hare down in the palm grove, he said: &ldquo;Come, show us the place you meant.&rdquo; &ldquo;I dare not, my lord,&rdquo; said the hare. &ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said the lion.</p>
<p class="p7">The hare, not venturing to go near the wood apple tree, stood afar off and cried, &ldquo;Yonder, sir, is the place of dreadful sound,&rdquo; and so saying, he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;From the spot where I did dwell</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Issued forth a fearful thud;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What it was I could not tell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor what caused it understood.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After hearing what the hare said, the lion went to the foot of the wood apple tree, and saw the spot where the hare had been lying beneath the shade of the palm tree, and the ripe wood apple fruit that fell on the palm leaf, and having carefully ascertained that the earth had not broken up, he placed the hare on his back and with the speed of a lion soon came again to the herd of beasts.</p>
<p class="p7">Then he told them the whole story, and said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo; And having thus reassured the herd of beasts, he let them go. Verily, if it had not been for the Bodhisatta at that time, all the beasts would have rushed into the sea and perished. It was all owing to the Bodhisatta that they escaped death.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Alarmed at sound of fallen fruit</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A hare once ran away,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The other beasts all followed suit</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Moved by that hare&rsquo;s dismay. </span><span class="t18">[3.52]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. They hastened not to view the scene,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But lent a willing ear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To idle gossip, and were clean</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Distraught with foolish fear. </span><a id="a8417"></a><span class="t18">{3.78}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. They who to wisdom&rsquo;s calm delight</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And virtue&rsquo;s heights attain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though ill example should invite,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Such panic fear disdain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">These three verses were spoken after Fully Awakening.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time I myself was the lion.&rdquo;</span></p>
