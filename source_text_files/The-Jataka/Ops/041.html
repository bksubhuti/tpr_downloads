<p class="p7"><a id="a5103"></a><span class="t15">Alternative Title: Dhammadhajajātaka (Cst)</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Devadatta is going around trying to kill the Buddha. The latter tells a story about how how in the past a corrupt official had tried to get him killed using various strategems, but with the help of Sakka he was always defeated. Eventually he was tasked with finding a man with four good qualities to look after a palace &ndash; and again he managed to find one.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (the family priest) Dhammaddhaja,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a5104"></a><span class="t15">Sāriputta = (the ornament maker) Chattapāṇi,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a5105"></a><span class="t15">Devadatta = (the general) Kāḷaka.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a5106"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Corruption, Envy, Devas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;You look as though.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.131]</span><span class="t30"> This was told by the Teacher while staying at the Bamboo Grove, about attempts to murder him. On this occasion, as before, the Teacher said: &ldquo;This is not the first time Devadatta has tried to murder me and has not even frightened me. He did the same before.&rdquo; And he told this story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5107"></a>In the past a king named Yasapāṇi [Fame Bearer], reigned at Benares. His chief captain was named Kāḷaka [Blackie]. At that time the Bodhisatta was his family priest, and had the name of Dhammaddhaja [Banner of the Dhamma]. There was also a man Chattapāṇi [Parasol Bearer], a maker of ornaments to the king. The king was a good king. But his chief captain swallowed bribes in the judging of causes; he was a backbiter; he took bribes, and defrauded the rightful owners.</p>
<p class="p7">On a day, one who had lost his suit was departing from the court, weeping and stretching out his arms, <span class="t18">{2.187}</span> when he fell in with the Bodhisatta as he was going to pay his service to the king. Falling at his feet, the man cried out, telling how he had been worsted in his cause, &ldquo;Although such as you, my lord, instruct the king in the things of this world and the next, the commander-in-chief takes bribes, and defrauds rightful owners!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta pitied him. &ldquo;Come, my good fellow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will judge your cause for you!&rdquo; and he proceeded to the court-house. A great company gathered together. The Bodhisatta reversed the sentence, and gave judgement for him who was in the right. The spectators applauded. The sound was great. The king heard it, and asked, &ldquo;What sound is this I hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My lord king,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;it is a cause wrongly judged that has been judged aright by the wise Dhammaddhaja; that is why there is this shout of applause.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king was pleased and sent for the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;They tell me,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that you have judged a cause?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, great king, I have judged that which Kāḷaka did not judge aright.&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.132]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Be you judge from this day,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;it will be a joy for my ears, and prosperity for the world!&rdquo; He was unwilling, but the king begged him, &ldquo;In mercy to all creatures, sit in judgement!&rdquo; and so the king won his consent.</p>
<p class="p7">From that time Kāḷaka received no presents; and losing his gains he spoke calumny of the Bodhisatta before the king, saying: &ldquo;O mighty king, the wise Dhammaddhaja covets your kingdom!&rdquo; But the king would not believe; and bade him say not so.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;If you do not believe me,&rdquo; said Kāḷaka, &ldquo;look out of the window at the time of his coming. Then you will see that he has got the whole city into his own hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king saw the crowd of those that were about him in his judgement hall. &ldquo;There is his retinue,&rdquo; thought he. He gave way. &ldquo;What are we to do, captain?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;My lord, he must be put to death.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.188} </span>&ldquo;How can we put him to death without having found him out in some great wickedness?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;There is a way,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;What way?&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell him to do what is impossible, and if he cannot, put him to death for that.&rdquo; &ldquo;But what is impossible to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My lord king,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;it takes two years or twice two for a garden with good soil to bear fruit, being planted and tended. Send you for him, and say &ndash; &lsquo;We want a garden to disport ourselves in tomorrow. Make us a garden!&rsquo; This he will not be able to do; and we will slay him for that fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king addressed himself to the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;Wise sir, we have sported long enough in our old garden; now we crave to sport in a new. Make us a garden! If you cannot make it, you must die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5108"></a>The Bodhisatta reasoned, it must be that Kāḷaka has set the king against me, because he gets no presents. &ldquo;If I can,&rdquo; he said to the king, &ldquo;O mighty king, I will see to it.&rdquo; And he went home. After a good meal he lay upon his bed, thinking. Sakka&rsquo;s throne grew hot.<a id="a5109"></a><a href="notes.html#a15192"><span class="t9">{458}</span></a> Sakka reflecting perceived the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s difficulty. He made haste to him, entered his chamber, and asked him, &ldquo;Wise sir, what think you on?&rdquo; poised the while in mid-air.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked the Bodhisatta. <span class="t18">[2.133] </span>&ldquo;I am Sakka.&rdquo; &ldquo;The king bids me make a garden: that is what I am thinking upon.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wise sir, do not trouble: I will make you a garden like the groves of Nandana and Cittalatā! In what place shall I make it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;In such and such a place,&rdquo; he told him. Sakka made it, and returned to the city of the gods.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day, the Bodhisatta beheld the garden there in very truth, and sought the king&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;O king, the garden is ready: go to your sport!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king came to the place, and beheld a garden girt with a fence of eighteen cubits, vermilion tinted, having gates and ponds, <span class="t18">{2.189}</span> beautiful with all manner of trees laden heavy with flowers and fruit! &ldquo;The sage has done my bidding,&rdquo; said he to Kāḷaka, &ldquo;now what are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;O mighty king!&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;if he can make a garden in one night, can he not seize upon your kingdom?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, what are we to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;We will make him perform another impossible thing.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;We will bid him make a lake possessed of the seven precious jewels!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king agreed, and thus addressed the Bodhisatta: &ldquo;Teacher, you have made a park. Make now a lake to match it, with the seven precious jewels. If, you cannot make it, you shall not live!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very good, great king,&rdquo; answered the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;I will make it if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then Sakka made a lake of great splendour, having a hundred landing-places, a thousand inlets, covered over with lotus plants of five different colours, like the lake in Nandana.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day, the Bodhisatta beheld this also, and told the king, &ldquo;See, the lake is made!&rdquo; And the king saw it, and asked of Kāḷaka what was to be done.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Bid him, my lord, make a house to suit it,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Make a house, Teacher,&rdquo; said the king to the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;all of ivory, to suit with the park and the lake: if you do not make it, you must die!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then Sakka made him a house likewise. The Bodhisatta beheld it next day, and told the king. When the king had seen it, he asked Kāḷaka again, what was to do. Kāḷaka told him to bid the Bodhisatta make a jewel to suit the house. The king said to him, &ldquo;Wise sir, make a jewel to suit with this ivory house; I will go about looking at it by the light of the jewel: if you cannot make one, you must die! &ldquo;Then Sakka <span class="t18">[2.134] </span>made him a jewel too. Next day the Bodhisatta beheld it, and told the king. <span class="t18">{2.190}</span> When the king had seen it, he again asked Kāḷaka what was to be done.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5110"></a>&ldquo;Mighty king!&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I think there is some Devatā who does each thing that the brahmin Dhammaddhaja wishes. Now bid him make something which even a divinity cannot make. Not even a deity can make a man with all four virtues;<a id="a5111"></a><a href="notes.html#a15194"><span class="t9">{459}</span></a> therefore bid him make a keeper with these four.&rdquo; So the king said: &ldquo;Teacher, you have made a park, a lake, and a palace, and a jewel to give light. Now make me a keeper with four virtues, to watch the park; if you cannot, you must die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;if it is possible, I will see to it.&rdquo; He went home, had a good meal, and lay down. When he awoke in the morning, he sat upon his bed, and thought thus. &ldquo;What the great king Sakka can make by his power, that he has made. He cannot make a park-keeper with four virtues. This being so, it is better to die forlorn in the woods, than to die at the hand of other men.&rdquo; So saying no word to any man, he went down from his dwelling and passed out of the city by the chief gate, and entered the woods, where he sat him down beneath a tree and reflected upon the dispensation of the good. Sakka perceived it; and in the fashion of a forester he approached the Bodhisatta, saying,</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Brahmin, you are young and tender: why sit you here in this wood, as though you had never seen pain before?&rdquo; As he asked it, he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;You look as though your life must happy be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet to the wild woods you would homeless go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like some poor wretch whose life was misery,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And pine beneath this tree in lonely woe.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{2.191}</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this the Bodhisatta made answer in the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;I look as though my life must happy be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet to the wild woods I would homeless go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like some poor wretch whose life was misery,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And pine beneath this tree in lonely woe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pondering the truth that all the saints do know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka said: &ldquo;If so, then why, brahmin, are you sitting here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;The king,&rdquo; he made answer, &ldquo;requires a park-keeper with four good qualities; such a one cannot be found; so I thought: &ldquo;Why perish by the hand of man? I will off to the woods, and die a lonely death. So here I came, and here I sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the other replied, &ldquo;Brahmin, I am Sakka, King of the Devas. By <span class="t18">[2.135] </span>me was your park made, and those other things. A park-keeper possessed of four virtues cannot be made; but in your country there is one Chattapāṇi, who makes ornaments for the head, and he is such a man. If a park-keeper is wanted, go and make this workman the keeper.&rdquo; With these words Sakka departed to his divine city, after consoling him and bidding him fear no more. <span class="t18">{2.192}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta went home, and having broken his fast, he repaired to the palace gates, and there in that spot he saw Chattapāṇi. He took him by the hand, and asked him, &ldquo;Is it true, as I hear, Chattapāṇi, that you are endowed with the four virtues?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Who told you so?&rdquo; asked the other. &ldquo;Sakka, King of the Devas.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did he tell you?&rdquo; He recounted all, and told the reason. The other said,</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yes, I am endowed with the four virtues.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta taking him by the hand led him into the king&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Here, mighty monarch, is Chattapāṇi, endowed with four virtues. If there is need of a keeper for the park, make him keeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Is it true, as I hear,&rdquo; the king asked him, &ldquo;that you have four virtues?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, mighty king.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ldquo;I envy not, and drink no wine;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No strong desire, no wrath is mine,&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">said he.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why, Chattapāṇi,&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;did you say you have no envy?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, O king, I have no envy.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are the things you do not envy?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5112"></a>&ldquo;Listen, my lord!&rdquo; said he; and then he told how he felt no envy in the following lines:<a id="a5113"></a><a href="notes.html#a15196"><span class="t9">{460}</span></a> <span class="t18">[2.136]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ldquo;A family priest once in bonds I threw</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which thing a woman made me do:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He built me up in holy lore;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Since when I never envied more.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{2.193}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a5114"></a>Then the king said: &ldquo;Dear Chattapāṇi, why do you abstain from strong drink?&rdquo; And the other answered in the following verse:<a id="a5115"></a><a href="notes.html#a15198"><span class="t9">{461}</span></a><span class="t18"> [2.137]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ldquo;Once I was drunken, and I ate</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My own son&rsquo;s flesh upon my plate;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then, touched with sorrow and with pain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Swore never to touch drink again.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{2.194}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a5116"></a>Then the king said: &ldquo;But what, dear sir, makes you indifferent, without love?&rdquo; The man explained it in these words:<a id="a5117"></a><a href="notes.html#a15200"><span class="t9">{462}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5118"></a><span class="t12">1. Sukhaṁ jīvitarūposi, raṭṭhā vivanam-āgato,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5119"></a><a id="a5120"></a><a id="a5121"></a><span class="t12">So ekako rukkhamūle, kapaṇo viya jhāyasī ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a5122"></a><a id="a5123"></a><a id="a5124"></a><a id="a5125"></a><a id="a5126"></a><a id="a5127"></a><span class="t4">Your life looks happy, leaving the kingdom you go to the desert, alone at the root of a tree, do you meditate like a wretch? </span><span class="t18">{2.195}</span></p>
<p class="p23">Said the king then, &ldquo;What was it, good friend, that made you to be without anger?&rdquo; And the other made the matter clear in these lines:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5128"></a><a id="a5129"></a><span class="t12">2. Sukhaṁ jīvitarūposmi, raṭṭhā vivanam-āgato,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So ekako rukkhamūle,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5130"></a><span class="t12">Kapaṇo viya jhāyāmi, sataṁ Dhammaṁ anussaran-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a5131"></a><a id="a5132"></a><a id="a5133"></a><span class="t4">My life looks happy, leaving the kingdom I go to the desert, alone at the root of a tree, just like a wretch I meditate, recollecting the good Dhamma.</span></p>
<p class="p23">When Chattapāṇi had thus explained his four attributes, the king made a sign to his attendants. And in an instant all the court, <span class="t18">{2.196}</span> monastic and laymen and all, rose up, and cried out upon Kāḷaka, &ldquo;Fie, bribe-swallowing thief and scoundrel! You couldn&rsquo;t get your bribes, and so you would murder the wise man by speaking ill of him!&rdquo; They seized him by hand and foot, and bundled him out of the palace; and catching up whatever <span class="t18">[2.138] </span>they could get hold of, this a stone, and this a staff, they broke his head and did him to death: and dragging him by the feet they cast him upon a dunghill.</p>
<p class="p7">Thenceforward the king ruled in righteousness, until he passed away and traveled on according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This discourse ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Devadatta was the Commander Kāḷaka, Sāriputta was the artisan Chattapāṇi, and I was Dhammaddhaja.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h3 class="h30"><a id="ncx8220"></a><a id="a5134"></a><a id="a5135"></a><a id="a5136"></a><a id="a5137"></a><a id="a5138"></a><a id="a5139"></a>Ja 221 Kāsāvajātaka<br/>The Story about the Renunciant&rsquo;s Robe (2s)</h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present laymen club together and offer robes to Devadatta. The Buddha, hearing about it, tells a story of how a hunter had dressed as a Paccekabuddha in order to kill elephants, and how he had rebuked him for dishonouring the robes.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the master of the herd (yūthapati),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Devadatta = the man who killed elephants (hatthimārakapurisa).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a5140"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Dissemblance, Cheating.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;If any man.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying at Jetavana, about Devadatta.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">It was occasioned by something that happened at Rājagaha. At one period the Captain of the Dhamma was living with five hundred monks at the Bamboo Grove. And Devadatta, with a body of men, wicked, like himself, lived at Gayāsīsa.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At that time the citizens of Rājagaha used to club together for the purpose of almsgiving. A trader, who had come there on business, brought a magnificent perfumed yellow robe, asking that he might become one of them, and give this garment as his contribution. The townspeople brought plenty of gifts. All that was contributed by those who had clubbed together consisted of ready money. There was this garment left. The crowd which had come together said: &ldquo;Here is this beautiful perfumed robe left over. Who shall have it &ndash; elder Sāriputta, or Devadatta?&rdquo; Some were in favour of Sāriputta; others said: &ldquo;Elder Sāriputta will stay here a few days, </span><span class="t18">{2.197}</span><span class="t30"> and then go travelling at his own sweet will; but Devadatta always lives near our city; he is our refuge in good fortune or ill. Devadatta shall have it!&rdquo; They made a division, and those who voted for Devadatta were in the majority. So to Devadatta they gave it. He had it cut in strips, and sewn together, and coloured like gold, and so he wore it upon him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At the same time, thirty monks went from Rājagaha to Sāvatthi to salute the Teacher. After greetings had been exchanged, they told him all this affair, adding, &ldquo;And so, sir, Devadatta wears this mark of the saint, which suits him ill enough.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;this is not the first time that Devadatta has put on the garb of a saint, a most unsuitable dress. He did the same before.&rdquo; And then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta came into this world as an elephant in the Himālayas region.<span class="t18"> [2.139] </span>Lord of a herd that numbered eighty thousand wild elephants, he dwelt in the forest land.</p>
<p class="p7">A poor man that lived in Benares, seeing the workers of ivory in the ivory bazaar making bangles and all manner of ivory trinkets, asked them would they buy an elephant&rsquo;s tusks, if he should get them. To which they answered, yes.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5141"></a>So he took a weapon, and clothing himself in a yellow robe, he put on the guise of a Paccekabuddha,<a id="a5142"></a><a href="notes.html#a15203"><span class="t9">{463}</span></a> with a covering band about his head. Taking his stand in the path of the elephants, he slew one of them with his weapon, and sold the tusks of it in Benares; and in this manner he made a living. After this he began always to slay the very last elephant in the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s troop. Day by day the elephants grew fewer and fewer.</p>
<p class="p7">Then they went and asked the Bodhisatta how it was that their numbers dwindled. He perceived the reason. &ldquo;Some man,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;stands in the place where the elephants go, having made himself like a Paccekabuddha in appearance. Now can it be he that slays the elephants? I will find him out.&rdquo; So one day he sent the others on before him <span class="t18">{2.198}</span><a id="a5143"></a> and he followed after. The man saw the Bodhisatta, and made a rush at him with his weapon. The Bodhisatta turned and stood. &ldquo;I will beat him to the earth, and kill him!&rdquo; thought he, and stretched out his trunk &ndash; when he saw the yellow robes which the man wore. &ldquo;I ought to pay respect to those sacred robes!&rdquo; said he. So drawing back his trunk, he cried, &ldquo;O man! Is not that dress, the flag of an Arahat, unsuitable to you? Why do you wear it?&rdquo; and he repeated these lines:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5144"></a><a id="a5145"></a><a id="a5146"></a><span class="t12">1. Anikkasāvo kāsāvaṁ yo vatthaṁ paridahissati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5147"></a><a id="a5148"></a><span class="t12">Apeto damasaccena, na so kāsāvam-ar</span><span class="t46">a</span><span class="t12">hati.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a5149"></a><a id="a5150"></a><a id="a5151"></a><a id="a5152"></a><a id="a5153"></a><a id="a5154"></a><span class="t4">The one who, while still being impure, will put on the yellow robe, abstaining from restraint and truth, is not worthy of the yellow robe.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5155"></a><span class="t12">2. Yo ca vantakasāvassa, sīlesu susamāhito,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Upeto damasaccena, sa ve kāsāvam-ar</span><span class="t46">a</span><span class="t12">hatī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">The one who throws out any impurity, steady in virtue, endowed with restraint and truth, is worthy of the yellow robe. </span><span class="t18">{2.199}</span></p>
<p class="p23">With these words, the Bodhisatta rebuked the man, and bade him never come there again, else he should die for it. Thus he drove him away.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Devadatta was the man who killed the elephants, and the head of the herd was I.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Devadatta goes about trying to kill the Buddha, who tells a story from a past life in which a hunter had mercilessly killed him, when he was a monkey tending for his mother. Shortly afterwards, because of his wickedness, the earth swallowed up the hunter, fulfilling his teacher&rsquo;s prediction.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;I call to mind.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.140]</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5168"></a><span class="t30">One day the monks fell talking in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Friend, that man Devadatta is harsh, cruel, and tyrannical, full of baneful devices against the Supreme Buddha. He flung a stone,</span><a id="a5169"></a><a href="notes.html#a15207"><span class="t9">{465}</span></a><a id="a5170"></a><span class="t30"> he even used the aid of Nāḷāgiri;</span><a id="a5171"></a><a href="notes.html#a15209"><span class="t9">{466}</span></a><span class="t30"> pity and compassion there is none in him for the Tathāgata.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking about as they sat there. They told him. Then he said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that Devadatta has been harsh, cruel, merciless. He was so before.&rdquo; And he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5172"></a><a id="a5173"></a><a id="a5174"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta became a monkey named Nandiya [Jolly]; and dwelt in the Himālayas region; and his youngest brother bore the name of Cūḷanandiya [Little Jolly]. These two headed a band of eighty thousand monkeys, and they had a blind mother in their home to care for.</p>
<p class="p7">They left their mother in her lair in the bushes, and went amongst the trees to find sweet wild fruit of all kinds, which they sent back home to her. The messengers did not deliver it; and, tormented with hunger, she became nothing but skin and bone. Said the Bodhisatta to her, &ldquo;Mother, we send you plenty of sweet fruits: then what makes you so thin?&rdquo; &ldquo;My son, I never get it!&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.200}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta pondered. &ldquo;While I look after my herd, my mother will perish! I will leave the herd, and look after my mother alone.&rdquo; So calling his brother, &ldquo;Monk,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you tend the herd, and I will care for our mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Nay, brother,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;what care I for ruling a herd? I too will care only for our mother!&rdquo; So the two of them were of one mind, and leaving the herd, they brought their mother down out of the Himālayas, and took up their abode in a banyan tree of the border-land, where they took care of her. <span class="t18">[2.141]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now a certain brahmin, who lived at Taxila, had received his education from a famous teacher, and afterward he took leave of him, saying that he would depart. This teacher had the power of divining from the signs on a man&rsquo;s body; and thus he perceived that his pupil was harsh, cruel, and violent. &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are harsh, and cruel, and violent. Such persons do not prosper at all seasons alike; they come to dire woe and dire destruction. Be not harsh, nor do what you will afterwards repent.&rdquo; With this counsel, he let him go.</p>
<p class="p7">The youth took leave of his teacher, and went his way to Benares. There he married and settled down; and not being able to earn a livelihood by any other of his arts, he determined to live by his bow. So he set to work as a huntsman; and left Benares to earn his living. Dwelling in a border village, he would range the woods girt with bow and quiver, and lived by sale of the flesh of all manner of beasts which he slew.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, as he was returning homewards after having caught nothing at all in the forest, he observed a banyan tree standing on the verge of an open glade. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;there may be something here.&rdquo; And he turned his face towards the banyan tree. Now the two brothers had just fed their mother with fruits, and were sitting behind her in the tree, when they saw the man coming. &ldquo;Even if he sees our mother,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;what will he do?&rdquo; and they hid amongst the branches. Then this cruel man, as he came up to the tree and saw the mother monkey weak with age, and blind, thought to himself, &ldquo;Why should I return empty-handed? I will shoot this female monkey first!&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.201}</span> and lifted up his bow to shoot her. This the Bodhisatta saw, and said to his brother, &ldquo;Cūḷanandiya, my dear, this man wants to shoot our mother! I will save her life. When I am dead, do you take care of her.&rdquo; So saying, down he came out of the tree, and called out,</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;O man, don&rsquo;t shoot my mother! She is blind, and weak for age. I will save her life; don&rsquo;t kill her, but kill me instead!&rdquo; and when the other had promised, he sat down in a place within bowshot. The hunter pitilessly shot the Bodhisatta; when he dropped, the man prepared his bow to shoot the mother monkey. Cūḷanandiya saw this, and thought to himself, &ldquo;That hunter wants to shoot my mother. Even if she only lives a day, she will have received the gift of life; I will give my life for hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Accordingly, down he came from the tree, and said: &ldquo;O man, don&rsquo;t shoot my mother! I give my life for hers. Shoot me &ndash; take both us brothers, and spare our mother&rsquo;s life!&rdquo; The hunter consented, and Cūḷanandiya squatted down within bowshot. The hunter shot this one too, and killed him, &ldquo;It will do for my children at home,&rdquo; thought he &ndash; and he shot the mother too; hung them all three on his carrying pole, and set his face homewards.</p>
<p class="p7">At that moment a thunderbolt fell upon the <span class="t18">[2.142] </span>house of this wicked man, and burnt up his wife and two children with the house: nothing was left but the roof and the bamboo uprights.</p>
<p class="p7">A man met him at the entrance to the village, and told him of it. Sorrow for his wife and children overcame him: down on the spot he dropped his pole with the game, and his bow, threw off his garments, and naked he went homewards, wailing with hands outstretched. Then the bamboo uprights broke, and fell upon his head, and crushed it. The earth yawned, flame rose from hell. As he was being swallowed up in the earth, he thought upon his master&rsquo;s warning: <span class="t18">{2.202}</span> &ldquo;Then this was the teaching that the brahmin Pārāsariya gave me!&rdquo; and lamenting he uttered these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5175"></a><a id="a5176"></a><span class="t12">1.

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Māsu tvaṁ akari pāpaṁ, yaṁ tvaṁ pacchā kataṁ tape.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a5181"></a><span class="t4">This is the word of my teacher, this is what Pārāsariya said: &lsquo;Do not do anything wicked, which later will cause you regret.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5182"></a><span class="t12">2. Yāni karoti puriso, tāni attani passati,</span></p>

<p class="p23">Lamenting thus, he went down into the earth, and came to life in the depths of hell.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5186"></a><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, by which he showed how in other days, as then, Devadatta had been harsh, cruel, and merciless, he identified the Jātaka in these words, &ldquo;In those days Devadatta was the hunter, Sāriputta was the famous teacher, Ānanda was Cūḷanandiya, the noble lady Gotamī was the mother, and I was the monkey Nandiya.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one wealthy man hides a gift of rice he has received on a journey from his wife and eats it all himself. The Buddha tells a story about a queen who was unable to give gifts to the ascetics, as the king did not support her well.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Honour for honour.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about a landed proprietor.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Tradition has it that once a landowner who was a citizen of Sāvatthi did business with a landowner from the country. </span><span class="t18">{2.203}</span><span class="t30"> Taking his wife with him, he visited this man, his debtor; but the debtor averred that he could not pay. The other, in anger, set out for home without having broken his fast. On the road, some people met him; and seeing how famished the man was, gave him food, bidding him share it with his wife. </span><span class="t18">[2.143]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When he got this, he grudged his wife a share. So addressing her he said: &ldquo;Wife, this is a well-known haunt of thieves, so you had better go in front.&rdquo; Having thus got rid of her, he ate all the food, and then showed her the pot empty, saying: &ldquo;Look here, wife! They gave me an empty pot!&rdquo; She guessed that he had eaten it all up himself, and was much annoyed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">As they both passed by the monastery in Jetavana, they thought they would go into the park and get a drink of water. There sat the Teacher, waiting on purpose to see them, like a hunter on the trail, seated under the shade of his perfumed cell. He greeted then kindly, and said: &ldquo;Lay sister, is your husband kind and loving?&rdquo; &ldquo;I love him, sir,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but he does not love me; let alone other days, this very day he was given a pot of food on the way, and gave not a bit to me, but ate it all himself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lay sister, so it has always been &ndash; you loving and kind, and he loveless; but when by the help of the wise he learns your worth, he will do you all honour.&rdquo; Then, at her request, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, while Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was the son of one of the king&rsquo;s court. On coming of age he became the king&rsquo;s adviser in things temporal and spiritual. It happened that the king was afraid of his son, lest he might injure him; and sent him away. Taking his wife, the son departed from that city, and came to a village of Kāsi, where he dwelt. By and by when the father died, his son hearing of it set out to go back to Benares, &ldquo;That I may receive the kingdom which is my birthright,&rdquo; said he. On his way one gave him a mess of pottage, saying: &ldquo;Eat, and give to your wife also.&rdquo; But he gave her none, and did eat it all himself. <span class="t18">{2.204}</span> Thought she, &ldquo;A cruel man this, indeed!&rdquo; and she was full of sorrow.</p>
<p class="p7">When he had come to Benares, and received his kingdom, he made her the queen consort; but thinking: &ldquo;A little is enough for her,&rdquo; he showed her no other consideration or honour, not so much as to ask her how she did.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;This queen,&rdquo; thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;serves the king well, and loves him; but the king spends not a thought upon her. I will make him show her respect and honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So he came to the queen, and made salutation, and stood aside. &ldquo;What is it, dear sir?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5195"></a>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how can we serve you? Ought you not to give the elderly a piece of cloth or a dish of rice?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Dear sir, I never receive anything myself; what shall I give to you? When I received, did I not give? But now the king gives me nothing at all; let alone giving anything else, as he was going along the road he received a bowl of rice, and never gave me a bit &ndash; he ate it all himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, madam, will you be able to say something in the king&rsquo;s presence?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. <span class="t18">[2.144]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very well then. Today, when I stand before the king, when I ask my question do you give the same answer; this very day will I make your goodness known.&rdquo; So the Bodhisatta went on before, and stood in the king&rsquo;s presence. And she too went and stood near the king.</p>
<p class="p7">Then said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Madam, you are very cruel. Ought you not to give the elderly a piece of cloth or a dish of food?&rdquo; And she made answer, &ldquo;Good sir, I myself receive nothing from the king; what can I give to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Are you not the queen consort?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Good sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what boots the place of a queen consort, when no respect is paid? What will the king give me now? When he received a dish of rice on the road, <span class="t18">{2.205}</span> he gave me none, but ate it all himself.&rdquo; And the Bodhisatta asked him, &ldquo;Is it so, O king?&rdquo; And the king assented. When the Bodhisatta saw that the king assented, &ldquo;Then lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why dwell here with the king after he has become unkindly? In the world, union without love is painful. While you dwell here, loveless union with the king will bring you sorrow. These folk honour him that honours, and when one honours not &ndash; as soon as you see it, you should go elsewhere; they that dwell in the world are many.&rdquo; And he repeated the verses following:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5196"></a><a id="a5197"></a><a id="a5198"></a><a id="a5199"></a><span class="t12">1. Name namantassa, bhaje bhajantaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p23">Hearing this, the king gave his queen all honour; and from that time forward they dwelt together in friendship and harmony. <span class="t18">{2.206}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the husband and wife entered on the Fruit of the First Path. &ldquo;The husband and wife are the same in both cases, and the wise counsellor was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Being informed of Devadatta&rsquo;s murderous intent, the Teacher said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that Devadatta has gone about seeking to kill me; he did just the same in bygone days, but failed to work his wicked will.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life again as a monkey. When full-grown, he was as big as a mare&rsquo;s foal and enormously strong. He lived alone on the banks of a river, in the middle of which was an island whereon grew mangoes and breadfruits, and other fruit trees. And in mid-stream, halfway between the island and the riverbank, a solitary rock rose out of the water. Being as strong as an elephant, the Bodhisatta used to leap from the bank on to this rock and thence on to the island. Here he would eat his fill of the fruits that grew on the island, returning at evening by the way he came. And such was his life from day to day.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now there lived in those days in that river a crocodile and his mate; and she, being with young, was led by the sight of the Bodhisatta journeying to and fro to conceive a longing for the monkey&rsquo;s heart to eat. So she begged her lord to catch the monkey for her. Promising that she should have her fancy, the crocodile went off and took his stand on the rock, meaning to catch the monkey on his evening journey home.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">After ranging about the island all day, the Bodhisatta looked out at evening towards the rock and wondered why the rock stood so high out of the water. For the story goes that the Bodhisatta always marked the exact height of the water in the river, and of the rock in the water. So, when he saw that, though the water stood at the same level, the rock seemed to stand higher out of the water, he suspected that a crocodile might be lurking there to catch him. And, in order to find out the facts of the case, he shouted, as though addressing the rock, &ldquo;Hi! Rock!&rdquo; And, as no reply came back, he shouted three times, &ldquo;Hi! Rock!&rdquo; And as the rock still kept silence, the monkey called out, &ldquo;How comes it, friend rock, that you won&rsquo;t answer me today?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; thought the crocodile, &ldquo;so the rock&rsquo;s in the habit of answering the monkey. I must answer for the rock today.&rdquo; Accordingly, he shouted, &ldquo;Yes, monkey; what is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a crocodile.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you sitting on that rock for? &ldquo;To catch you and eat your heart.&rdquo; As there was no other way back, the only thing to be done was to outwit the crocodile. So the Bodhisatta cried out, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help for it then but to give myself up to you. Open your mouth and catch me when I jump.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now you must know that when crocodiles open their mouths, their eyes shut. So, when this crocodile unsuspiciously opened his mouth, his eyes shut. And there he waited with closed eyes and open jaws! Seeing this, the wily monkey made a jump on to the crocodile&rsquo;s head, and thence, with a spring like lightning, gained the bank. When the cleverness of this feat dawned on the crocodile, he said: &ldquo;Monkey, he that in this world possesses the four virtues overcomes his foes. And you, I think, possess all four.&rdquo; And, so saying, he repeated this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5213"></a><a id="a5214"></a><span class="t12">1. Yassete caturo dhammā, vānarinda, yathā tava:</span></p>

<p class="p22"><span class="t4">He who, monkey-king, like you, has these four things: Truth, wisdom, courage, charity, will overcome his foe.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5217"></a><a id="a5218"></a><span class="t12">2. Yassa cete na vijjanti guṇā paramabhaddakā,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a5219"></a><a id="a5220"></a><span class="t4">For whoever these supremely auspicious virtues are not found, truth, wisdom, courage, charity, will not overcome his foe.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t11">And with this praise of the Bodhisatta, the crocodile betook himself to his own dwelling-place.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Said the Teacher, &ldquo;This is not the first time then, monks, that Devadatta has gone about seeking to kill me; he did just the same in bygone days too.&rdquo; And, having ended his lesson, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Devadatta was the crocodile of those days, the brahmin-girl Ciñcā was the crocodile&rsquo;s wife, and I myself the monkey-king.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present a courtier had an affair in the king of Kosala&rsquo;s harem, and the king asked the Buddha advice as to what he should do. The Buddha told a story of courtier who was intriguing in the harem, while his attendant was intriguing with his own wife! When he complained about the attendant the king explained his own course of action was to be patient.</span></p>

The Teacher said: &ldquo;Other kings in days long gone by have done the same,&rdquo; and at his request, told the following story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, a man of his court fell into an intrigue in the king&rsquo;s harem, and an attendant of this courtier did the same thing in the courtier&rsquo;s house. The man could not endure to be thus affronted. So he led the other before the king, saying: &ldquo;My lord, <span class="t18">{2.207}</span> I have a servant who does all manner of work, and he has made me a cuckold: what must I do with him?&rdquo; and with the question he uttered this first verse following</p>

<p class="p23">The courtier saw that these words of the king were aimed at him; and for the future did do no wrong in the king&rsquo;s house. And the servant likewise, having come to know that the matter had been told to the king, in the future did that thing no more.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This discourse ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;I was the king of Benares.&rdquo; And the courtier on this occasion found out that the king had told of him to the Teacher, and never did such a thing again.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a5253"></a><a id="a5254"></a><a id="a5255"></a><a id="a5256"></a><span class="t34">One rainy season, disaffection broke out on his borders. The troops stationed there, after two or three battles in which they failed to conquer their adversaries, sent a message to the king. In spite of the season, in spite of the rains, he took the field, and encamped before Jetavana. Then he began to ponder. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis a bad season for an expedition; every crevice and hollow is full of water; the road is heavy: I&rsquo;ll go visit the Teacher. He will be sure to ask &lsquo;whither away;&rsquo; then I&rsquo;ll tell him. It is not only in things of the future life that our Teacher protects me, but he protects in the things which we now see. So if my going is not to prosper, he will say &lsquo;It is a bad time to go, sire;&rsquo; but if I am to prosper, he will say nothing.&rdquo; So into Jetavana he came, and after greeting the Teacher sat down on one side.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Whence come you, O king,&rdquo; asked the Teacher, &ldquo;at this unseasonable hour?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am on my way to quell a border rising; and I come first to bid you farewell.&rdquo; To this the Teacher said: &ldquo;So it happened before, that mighty monarchs, before setting out for war, have listened to the word of the wise, and turned back from an unseasonable expedition.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher as before told the king a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, the king of Benares having started for the field of war at an unseasonable time, set up a camp in his park. At that time an owl entered a thicket of bamboos, and hid in it. There came a flock of crows, &ldquo;We will catch him,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;so soon as he shall come out.&rdquo; And they compassed it around. Out he came before his time, nor did he wait until the sun should set; and tried to make his escape. The crows surrounded him, and pecked him with their beaks till he fell to the ground. The king asked the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Tell me, wise sir, why are the crows attacking this owl?&rdquo; And the Bodhisatta made answer, &ldquo;They that leave their dwelling before the right time, great king, fall into just such misery as this. Therefore before the time one should not leave one&rsquo;s <span class="t18">[2.147] </span>dwelling place.&rdquo; And to make the matter clear, he uttered this pair of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5257"></a><span class="t12">1. Kāle nikkhamanā sādhu, nākāle sādhu nikkhamo,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Well matched.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about one of the monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5286"></a><span class="t30">There stood at that time, about three-quarters</span><a id="a5287"></a><a href="notes.html#a15218"><span class="t9">{470}</span></a><span class="t30"> of a league from Jetavana, a market town, where a great deal of rice was distributed by ticket, and special meals were given. Here lived an inquisitive lout, who pestered the young monks and novices who came to share in the distribution &ndash; </span><span class="t18">{2.210}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Who are for solid food? Who for drink? Who for moist food?&rdquo; And he made those who could not answer feel ashamed, and they dreaded him so much that they would not go to that village.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5288"></a><span class="t30">One day, a monk came to the ticket-hall, with the question, &ldquo;Any food for distribution in such-and-such a village, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, friend,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a roughneck here asking questions; if you can&rsquo;t answer them, he abuses and reviles you. He is such a pest that nobody will go near the place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;give me an order on the place, and I&rsquo;ll humble him, and make him modest, and so influence him that whenever he sees you after this, he&rsquo;ll feel inclined to run away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks agreed, and gave the necessary order. The monk walked to our village, and at the gate of it he put on his robe. The loafer spied him &ndash; was at him like a mad ram, with, &ldquo;Answer me a question, monk!&rdquo; &ldquo;Layman, let me go first about the village for my broth, and then come back with it to the waiting hall.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When he returned with his meal, the man repeated his question. The monk answered, &ldquo;Leave me to finish my broth, to sweep the room, and to fetch my ticket&rsquo;s worth of rice.&rdquo; So he fetched the rice; then placing his bowl in this very man&rsquo;s hands, he said: &ldquo;Come, now I&rsquo;ll answer your question.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[2.148]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5289"></a><span class="t30">Then he led him outside the village, folded his outer robe, put it on his shoulder, and taking the bowl from the other, stood waiting for him to begin. The man said: &ldquo;Monk, answer me one question.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, so I will,&rdquo; said the monk; and with one blow he felled him to the ground, bruised his eyes, beat him, dropped filth in his face, and went off, with these parting words to frighten him, &ldquo;If ever again you ask a question of any monk who comes to this village, I&rsquo;ll see about it!&rdquo; After this, he took to his heels at the mere sight of a monk.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">By and by all this became known among the Saṅgha. One day they were talking about it in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Friend, I hear that monk So-and-so dropped filth in the face of that loafer, and left him!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and wanted to know what they were all talking about as they sat there. They told him. Said he, &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time this monk attacked the man with dirt, but he did just the same before.&rdquo; Then he told them a story. </span><span class="t18">{2.211}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, those citizens of the kingdoms of Aṅga and Magadha who were travelling from one land to the other, used to stay in a house on the marches of the two kingdoms, and there they drank liquor and ate the flesh of fish, and early in the morning they yoked their carts and went away. At the time when they came, a certain dung-beetle, led by the odour of dung, came to the place where they had drunken, and saw some liquor shed upon the ground, and for thirst he drank it, and returned to his lump of dung intoxicated. When he climbed upon it the moist dung gave way a little. &ldquo;The world cannot bear my weight!&rdquo; he bawled out. At that very instant a maddened elephant came to the spot, and smelling the dung went back in disgust. The beetle saw it. &ldquo;That creature,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;is afraid of me, and see how he runs away! &ndash; I must fight with him!&rdquo; and so he challenged him in the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5290"></a><a id="a5291"></a><a id="a5292"></a><a id="a5293"></a><a id="a5294"></a><a id="a5295"></a><span class="t12">1. Sūro sūrena saṅgamma, vikkantena pahārinā,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><a id="a5299"></a><span class="t12">Passantu Aṅgamagadhā mama tuyhañ-ca vikkaman-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a5300"></a><a id="a5301"></a><a id="a5302"></a><span class="t4">A hero comes across a hero, beating him with heroism, come, O Nāga, turn back again, why do you run away in fear? See, people of Aṅga and Magadha, my heroism and yours.</span></p>
<p class="p23">The elephant listened, and heard the voice; he turned back towards the beetle, and said the second verse, by way of rebuke:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5303"></a><span class="t12">2. Na taṁ pādā vadhissāmi, na dantehi, na soṇḍiyā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5304"></a><a id="a5305"></a><span class="t12">Mīḷhena taṁ vadhissāmi, pūti haññatu pūtinā ti.</span></p>

<p class="p23">And so, dropping a great piece of dung upon him, and making water, he killed him then and there; and scampered into the forest, trumpeting.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;In those days, this lout was the dung-beetle, the monk in question was the elephant, and I was the Tree Devatā who saw it all from a clump of trees.&rdquo;</span></p>

The circumstances will be explained in the Twelfth Book, and the Kāmajātaka [Ja 467].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5317"></a><a id="a5318"></a><span class="t34">A brahmin, so they say, who dwelt at Sāvatthi, was felling trees on the bank of the Aciravatī, in order to cultivate the land. The Teacher, when he visited Sāvatthi for alms, perceiving his destiny, went out of his road to talk sweetly with him. &ldquo;What are you doing, brahmin?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;O Gotama,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I am cutting a space free for cultivation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;go on with your work, brahmin.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">In the same manner the Teacher came and talked with him when the felled trunks were all away, and the man was clearing his acre, and again at plowing time, and at making the little embanked squares for water. Now on the day of sowing, the brahmin said: &ldquo;Today, O Gotama, is my plowing festival. When this corn is ripe, I will give alms in plenty to the Saṅgha, with the Buddha at their head.&rdquo; The Teacher accepted his offer, and went away. On another day he came, and saw the brahmin watching the corn. &ldquo;What are you doing, brahmin?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;Watching the corn, O Gotama!&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good, brahmin,&rdquo; said the Teacher, and away he went. Then the brahmin thought: &ldquo;How often Gotama the ascetic comes this way! Without doubt he wants food. Well, food I will give him.&rdquo; On the day when this thought came into his mind, when he went home, there he found the Teacher come also. Thereat arose in the brahmin a wondrous great confidence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">By and by, when ripe was the corn, the brahmin resolved, tomorrow he would reap the field. But while he lay in bed, in the upper reaches of the Aciravatī the rain fell heavily; down came a flood, and carried the whole crop away to the sea, so that not one stalk was left. When the flood</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t34">subsided, and the brahmin beheld the destruction of his crops, he had not the strength to stand: pressing his hand to his heart &ndash; for he was overcome with great sorrow &ndash; he went weeping home, and lay down lamenting.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5319"></a><a id="a5320"></a><span class="t34">In the morning the Teacher saw this brahmin overwhelmed with his woe, and he thought: &ldquo;I will be the brahmin&rsquo;s support.&rdquo; So next day, after his alms-round in Sāvatthi, on his return from receipt of food he sent the monks back to their monastery, and himself with the junior who attended him visited the man&rsquo;s house. When the brahmin heard of his coming, he took heart, thinking: &ldquo;My friend must be come for a kindly talk.&rdquo; He offered him a seat; the Teacher entering sat upon the seat indicated, and asked, &ldquo;Why are you downhearted, brahmin? What has happened to displease you?&rdquo; &ldquo;O Gotama!&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;from the time that I cut down the trees on the bank of the Aciravatī, you know what I have been doing. I have been going about, and promising gifts to you when that crop should be ripe: now a flood has carried off the whole crop, away to the sea, nothing is left at all! Grain has been destroyed to the amount of a hundred wagon-loads, and so I am deep in grief!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, will what is lost come back for grieving?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Gotama, that will it not.&rdquo; &ldquo;If that is so, why grieve? The wealth of beings in this world, or their corn, when they have it, they have it, and when it is gone, why, gone it is. No composite thing but is subject to destruction; do not brood over it.&rdquo; Thus comforting him, the Teacher repeated the Kāma discourse as appropriate to his case. At the conclusion of the discourse, the mourning brahmin was established in the Fruit of the First Path. The Teacher having eased him of his pain, arose from his seat, and returned to the monastery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">All the town heard how the Teacher had found such a brahmin pierced with the pangs of grief, had consoled him and established him in the Fruit of the First Path.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The monks talked of it in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Hear, sirs! The One with Ten Powers made friends with a brahmin, grew intimate, took his opportunity to declare the Dhamma to him, when pierced with the pangs of grief, eased him of pain, and established him in the Fruit of the First Path!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and asked, &ldquo;What do you speak of, monks, as you sit here together?&rdquo; They told him. He replied, &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, I have cured his grief, but I did the same long, long ago,&rdquo; and with these words he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">[The king of Benares had two sons.] And of these two sons the elder went to Benares, and became king: the youngest was the viceroy. He that was king was given over to the desire of riches, and the lust of the flesh, and was greedy of gain.</p>
<p class="p7">At the time, the Bodhisatta was Sakka, King of the Devas. And as he looked out upon Jambudīpa, and observed that the king of it was given over to these sensual desires, he said to himself, &ldquo;I will chastise that king, and make him ashamed.&rdquo; So taking the semblance of a young brahmin, he went to the king and looked at him. &ldquo;What wants this young fellow?&rdquo; the king asked.</p>
<p class="p7">Said he, &ldquo;Great king, I see three towns, prosperous, fertile, having elephants, horses, chariots and infantry in plenty, full of ornaments of gold and fine gold. These may be taken with a very small army. I have come here to offer to get them for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;When shall we go, young man?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;Tomorrow, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then leave me now; tomorrow early you shall go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Good, my king, hasten to prepare the army!&rdquo; And so saying <span class="t18">{2.213}</span> Sakka went back again to his own place.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day the king caused the drum to beat, and an army to be made ready; and having summoned his courtiers, he thus bespoke them: &ldquo;Yesterday a young brahmin came and said that he would conquer for me three cities &ndash; Uttarapañcāla, Indapatta, and Kekaka. Wherefore now we will go along with that man and conquer those cities. Summon him in all haste!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What place did you assign him, my lord, to dwell in?&rdquo; &ldquo;I gave him no place to dwell in,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;But you gave him wherewith to pay for a lodging!&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.150] </span>&ldquo;Nay, not even that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then how shall we find him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Seek him in the streets of the city,&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p class="p7">They sought, but found him not. So they came before the king, and told him, &ldquo;O king, we cannot see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Great sorrow fell upon the king. &ldquo;What glory has been snatched from me!&rdquo; he groaned; his heart became hot, his blood became disordered, dysentery attacked him, the physicians could not cure him.</p>
<p class="p7">After the space of three or four days, Sakka meditated, and was aware of his illness. Said he, &ldquo;I will cure him,&rdquo; and in the semblance of a brahmin he went and stood at his door. He caused it to be told the king, &ldquo;A brahmin physician is come to cure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">On hearing it, the king answered, &ldquo;All the great physicians of the court have not been able to cure me. Give him a fee, and let him go.&rdquo; Sakka listened, and made reply, &ldquo;I want not even money for my lodging, nor will I take fee for my craft. I will cure him: let the king see me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Then let him come in,&rdquo; said the king, on receiving this message. Then Sakka went in, and wishing victory to the king, sat on one side. &ldquo;Are you going to cure me?&rdquo; the king asked.</p>
<p class="p7">He replied, &ldquo;Even so, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Cure me, then!&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Very good, sire. Tell me the symptoms of your disease, and how it came about &ndash; what you have eaten or drunken, to bring it on, or what you have heard or seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Dear friend, my disease was brought upon me by something that I heard.&rdquo; Then the other asked, &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.214}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Dear sir, there came a young brahmin who offered to win and give me power over three cities; and I gave him neither lodging, nor wherewithal to pay for one. He must have grown angry with me, and gone away to some other king. So when I bethought me how great a glory had been snatched away from me, this disease came upon me; cure, if you can, this which has come upon me for my covetousness.&rdquo; And to make the matter clear he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5321"></a><a id="a5322"></a><span class="t12">1. Tayo giriṁ antaraṁ kāmayāmi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5323"></a><a id="a5324"></a><span class="t12">Pañcālā Kuruyo Kekake ca,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5325"></a><span class="t12">Tat-uttariṁ, brāhmaṇa, kāmayāmi</span></p>

<p class="p23">Then Sakka said: &ldquo;O king, by medicines made with roots you cannot <span class="t18">[2.151] </span>be cured, but you must be cured with the simple of knowledge,&rdquo; and he uttered the second verse as follows: <span class="t18">{2.215}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5333"></a><a id="a5334"></a><span class="t12">2. Kaṇhāhi daṭṭhassa karonti heke,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a5338"></a><a id="a5339"></a><a id="a5340"></a><span class="t4">Some there are who can work the bite of the cobras, the wise can work possession by Amanussa. But no one can work one who is led by desire, what cure is there for one fallen from purity?</span></p>
<p class="p23">So spake the Great Being to explain his meaning, and he added this yet beyond, &ldquo;O king, what if you were to get those three cities, then while you reigned over these four cities, could you wear four pairs of robes at once, eat out of four golden dishes, lie on four state beds? O king, one ought not to be mastered by desire. Desire is the root of all evil; when desire is increased, he that cherishes it is cast into the eight great hells, and the sixteen lowest hells, and into all kinds and manner of misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So the Great Being terrified the king with fear of hell and misery, and discoursed to him. And the king, by hearing his discourse, got rid of his heartbreak, and in a moment he became whole of his disease. <span class="t18">{2.216}</span> And Sakka, after giving him instruction, and establishing him in virtue, went away to the world of gods. And the king thenceforward gave alms and did good, and he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The monk who is a slave to his desires was at that time the king; and I myself was Sakka.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The crowd shouted for joy, and thronged into the park. &ldquo;What brings you here before your time?&rdquo; asked the Teacher. They told him what had happened.

<p class="p7">In the past, it befell that the Bodhisatta reigned as king in Taxila, of the realm of Gandhāra, and Brahmadatta in Benares.

And he made his army march, and came before the gate of the city; and when he saw the towers on the city gate, he asked whether that was the king&rsquo;s dwelling. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;is the gate tower.&rdquo; &ldquo;If the gate tower be such as this, of what sort will the king&rsquo;s palace be?&rdquo; he asked. And they replied, &ldquo;Like to Vejayanta, the palace of Sakka!&rdquo; On hearing it, the king said: &ldquo;With so glorious a king we shall never be able to fight!&rdquo; And having seen no more than the tower set upon the city gate, he turned and fled away, and came again to Benares.</p>

The mendicant, seeing the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; form like the form of Brahmā, his face like the glory of the full moon, and his forehead like a plate of gold, turned round where he had come, in the midst of the crowd, and ran off, saying: &ldquo;Who could overcome a man like this?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p23">Then the Bodhisatta disclosed his own glorious countenance, in fashion as the full moon; and threatening him, thus spoke, &ldquo;Fool, babble not vainly! Now will I destroy your host, as a maddened elephant crushes a thicket of reeds!&rdquo; and he repeated the second verse:</p>

They told him. The Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time that Devadatta has repudiated his teacher, and become my enemy, and come to utter destruction. The same thing happened before.&rdquo; Then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5448"></a>In the past, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as the son of an elephant trainer. When he grew up, he was taught all the art of managing the elephant. And there came a young villager from Kāsi, and was taught of him. Now when the future Buddhas teach any, they do not give a stingy dole of learning; but according to their own knowledge so teach they, keeping nothing back. So this youth learned all the branches of knowledge from the Bodhisatta, without omission; and when he had learned, said he to his master: <span class="t18">{2.222} </span>&ldquo;Teacher, I will go and serve the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Good, my son,&rdquo; said he; and he went before the king, and told him how that a pupil of his would serve the king. Said the king, &ldquo;Good, let him serve me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then do you know what fee to give?&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;A pupil of yours will not receive so much as you; if you receive a hundred, he shall have fifty; if you receive two, to him shall one be given.&rdquo; So the Bodhisatta went home, and told all this to his pupil.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;all your knowledge do I know, piece for piece. If I shall have the like payment, I will serve the king; but if not, then I will not serve him.&rdquo; And this the Bodhisatta told to the king.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5449"></a>Said the king, &ldquo;If the young man could do even as you &ndash; if he is able to show skill for skill with you, he shall receive the like.&rdquo; And the Bodhisatta told this to the pupil, and the pupil made answer, &ldquo;Very good, I will.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;do you make exhibition of your skill.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good, I will; let proclamation be made by beat of drum.&rdquo; And the king caused it to be proclaimed, &ldquo;Tomorrow the master and the pupil will <span class="t18">[2.155] </span>make show together of their skill in managing the elephant. Tomorrow let all that wish to see gather together in the courtyard of the palace, and see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5450"></a>&ldquo;My pupil,&rdquo; thought the teacher to himself, &ldquo;does not know all my resources.&rdquo; So he chose an elephant, and in one night he taught him to do all things awry. He taught him to back when bidden go forward, and to go forward when told to back; to lie down when bidden to rise, and to rise when bidden to lie down; to drop when told to pick up, and to pick up when told to drop.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day mounting his elephant he came to the palace yard. And his pupil also was there, mounted upon a beautiful elephant. There was a great concourse of people. They both showed all their skill. But the Bodhisatta gave his elephant reverse orders; <span class="t18">{2.223}</span> &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; said he, and it backed up, &ldquo;Back up!&rdquo; and it ran forward, &ldquo;Stand up!&rdquo; and it lay down, &ldquo;Lie down!&rdquo; and it stood up, &ldquo;Pick it up!&rdquo; and the creature dropped it, &ldquo;Drop it!&rdquo; and he picked it up. And the crowd cried, &ldquo;Go to, you rascal! Do not raise your voice against your master! You do not know your own measure, and you think you can match yourself against him!&rdquo; and they assailed him with clods and staves, so that he gave up the ghost then and there. And the Bodhisatta came down from his elephant, and approaching the king, addressed him thus:</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;O mighty king! For their own good men get them taught; but there was one to whom his learning brought misery with it, like an ill-made shoe,&rdquo; and he uttered these two verses:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Your own idea.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.156]</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying at Jetavana, about a young lady.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">She was the only daughter of a rich merchant of Sāvatthi. She noticed that in her father&rsquo;s house a great fuss was made over a fine bull, and asked her nurse what it meant. &ldquo;Who is this, nurse, that is honoured so?&rdquo; The nurse replied that it was a right royal bull.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Another day she was looking from an upper storey down the street, when lo, she spied a hunchback. </span><span class="t18">{2.225}</span><span class="t30"> Thought she, &ldquo;In the cow tribe, the leader has a hump. I suppose it&rsquo;s the same with men. That must be a right, royal man, and I must go and be his humble follower.&rdquo; So she sent her maid to say that the merchant&rsquo;s daughter wished to join herself to him, and he was to wait for her in a certain spot. She collected her treasures together, and disguising herself; left the mansion and went off with the hunchback.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">By and by all this became known in the town and among the Saṅgha. In the Dhamma Hall, the monks discussed its bearings, &ldquo;Friend, there is a merchant&rsquo;s daughter who has eloped with a hunchback!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and asked what they were all talking about together. They told him. He replied, &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that she has fallen in love with a hunchback. She did the same before.&rdquo; And he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a rich man&rsquo;s family in a certain market town. When he came of age, he lived as a householder, and was blessed with sons and daughters, and for his son&rsquo;s wife he chose the daughter of a rich citizen of Benares, and fixed the day.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the girl saw in her home honour and reverence offered to a bull. She asked of her nurse, &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; &ldquo;A right royal bull,&rdquo; said she. And afterward the girl saw a hunchback going through the street. &ldquo;That must be a right royal man!&rdquo; thought she; and taking with her the best of her belongings in a bundle, she went off with him.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta also, having a mind to fetch the girl home, set out for Benares with a great company; and he travelled by the same road.</p>
<p class="p7">The pair went along the road all night long. All night long the hunch-back was overcome with thirst; and at the sunrise, he was attacked by colic, and great pain came upon him. So he went off the road, dizzy with pain, and fell down, like a broken lute-stick, huddled together; the girl too sat down at his feet. The Bodhisatta observed her sitting at the hunch-back&rsquo;s feet, and recognised her. Approaching, he talked with her, repeating the first verse: <span class="t18">{2.226}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5496"></a><a id="a5497"></a><span class="t12">1. Ekacintito yam-attho bālo apariṇāyako,</span></p>

<p class="p23">And hearing his voice, the girl answered by the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5505"></a><a id="a5506"></a><span class="t12">2. Purisūsabhaṁ maññamānā, ahaṁ khujjam-akāmayiṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p23">And when the Bodhisatta perceived that she had only followed him in disguise, he caused her to bathe, and adorned her, and took her into his carriage and went to his home.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The girl is the same in both cases; and the merchant of Benares was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is overcome with desire and about to fall away. The Buddha tells a story about a crocodile who, hearing the king call the fish to their meal, came to feed on the fish for himself, was harpooned and eventually died.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">He was brought into the Dhamma Hall, and asked if he were really discontent; to which he replied yes. When asked why, he replied, &ldquo;Because of the quality of desire.&rdquo; The Teacher said: &ldquo;Desire is like two-barbed arrows for getting lodgement in the heart; once there, they kill, as the barbed arrows killed the crocodile.&rdquo; Then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, the Bodhisatta was king of Benares, and a good king he was. One day he entered his park, and came to the side of a lake. And those who were clever with dance and song began to dance and to sing. The fish and turtles, eager to hear the sound of song, flocked together and went along beside the king. And the king, seeing a mass of fish as long as a palm trunk, asked his courtiers, &ldquo;Now why do these fish follow me?&rdquo; Said the courtiers, &ldquo;They are coming to offer their services to their lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king was pleased at this saying, that they were come to serve him, and ordered rice to be given to them regularly. At the time of feeding some of the fish came, and some did not; and rice was wasted. They told the king of it. &ldquo;Henceforward,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;at the time for <span class="t18">[2.158] </span>the giving of rice let a drum be sounded; and at the sound of the drum, when the fish flock together, give the food to them.&rdquo; From thenceforth the feeder caused a drum to sound, and when they flocked together gave rice to the fish. As they were gathered thus, eating the food, came a crocodile and ate some of the fish. The feeder told the king. The king listened. &ldquo;When the crocodile is eating the fish,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;pierce him with a harpoon, and capture him.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.228}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; the man said. And he went aboard a boat, and so soon as the crocodile was come to eat the fish, he pierced him with a harpoon. It went into his back. Mad with pain, the crocodile went off with the harpoon. Perceiving that he was wounded, the feeder spake to him by this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5518"></a><a id="a5519"></a><span class="t12">1. Kāmaṁ yahiṁ icchasi tena gaccha,</span></p>

<p class="p23">When the crocodile got to his own place, he died.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this matter, the Teacher having become perfectly enlightened spake the second verse as follows:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Tradition tells us that a certain man at Sāvatthi, a servant of the Teacher&rsquo;s two chief disciples, had one beautiful and happy daughter. When she grew </span><span class="t18">[2.159] </span><span class="t30">up, she married into a family as good as her own. The husband, without consulting anybody, used to enjoy himself elsewhere at his own sweet will. She took no notice of his disrespect; but invited the two chief disciples, made them presents, and listened to their preaching, until she reached the Fruit of the First Path. After this she spent all her time in the enjoyment of the Path and the Fruit; at last, thinking that as her husband did not want her, there was no need for her to remain in the household, she determined to embrace the ascetic life. She informed her parents of her plan, carried it out, and became a saint.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Her story became known amongst the Saṅgha; and one day they were discussing it in the Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;Friend, the daughter of such and such a family strives to attain the highest good. Finding that her husband did not care for her, she made rich presents to the chief disciples, listened to their preaching, and gained the Fruit of the First Path; she took leave of her parents, became an ascetic, and then a saint. So, friend, the girl sought the highest good.&rdquo; While they were talking, the Teacher came in and asked what it was all about. They told him. He said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that she seeks the highest; she did so in olden days as well.&rdquo; And he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was living as an ascetic, in the Himālayas region; and he had cultivated the Super Knowledges and Attainments. Then the king of Benares, observing how magnificent was the pomp of his son prince Brahmadatta, was filled with suspicion, and banished his son from the realm. <span class="t18">{2.230}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a5557"></a>The youth with his wife Asitābhū made their way to the Himālayas, and took up his abode in a hut of leaves, with fish to eat, and all manner of wild fruits. He saw a woodland Kinnarī, and became enamoured of her. &ldquo;Her will I make my wife!&rdquo; said he, and not thinking of Asitābhū, he followed after her steps. His wife seeing that he followed after the Kinnarī, was angry. &ldquo;The man cares nought for me,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;what have I to do with him?&rdquo; So she came to the Bodhisatta, and did him reverence: she learned what she must needs do to be initiated, and by focusing on the Meditation Object, she developed the Super Knowledges and Attainments, bade the Bodhisatta farewell, and returning stood at the door of her hut of leaves.</p>
<p class="p7">Now Brahmadatta followed the Kinnarī, but saw not by what way she went; and baulked of his desire he set his face again for the hut. Asitābhū saw him coming, and rose up in the air; and poised upon a plane in the air of the colour of a precious stone, she said to him, &ldquo;My young lord! &rsquo;Tis through you that I have attained this Absorption!&rdquo; and she uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5558"></a><a id="a5559"></a><a id="a5560"></a><a id="a5561"></a><a id="a5562"></a><span class="t12">1. Tvam-eva dāni-m-akara, yaṁ kāmo byagamā tayi,</span></p>

<p class="p23">So saying, as he looked, she rose up and departed to another place. And when she had gone, he uttered the second verse, lamenting: <span class="t18">{2.231}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a5570"></a><a id="a5571"></a><a id="a5572"></a><a id="a5573"></a><span class="t12">2. Atricchaṁ atilobhena atilobhamadena ca,</span></p>

<p class="p23">And having moaned in this verse, he dwelt alone in the forest, and at his father&rsquo;s death he received the sovereignty.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;These two people were then the prince and princess, and I was the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
