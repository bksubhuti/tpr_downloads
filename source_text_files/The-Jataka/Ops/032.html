The Buddha says that he could do this also in the past, and shows how his last words in that life had been correctly interpreted by his chief disciple.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;He who, with wisdom.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [1.292]</span><a id="a2924"></a><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{1.474}</span><span class="t30"> This story too was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about the interpretation of a problem by the elder Sāriputta at the gate of Saṅkassa.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At that time the Teacher put a question concisely to that elder. This is the full story, put briefly, of the descent from the world of gods. When the venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja had by his Supernormal Powers gained the sandalwood bowl in the presence of the great merchant of Rājagaha, the Teacher forbade the monks to use their miraculous Supernormal Powers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then the schismatics thought: &ldquo;The ascetic Gotama has forbidden the use of miraculous Supernormal Powers: now he will do no miracle himself.&rdquo; Their disciples were disturbed, and said to the schismatics, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you take the bowl by your Supernormal Powers?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;This is no hard thing for us, friend. But we think, &lsquo;Who will display before the laity his own fine and subtle powers for the sake of a paltry wooden bowl?&rsquo; and so we did not take it. The ascetics of the Sakya class took it, and showed their Supernormal Powers for sheer foolish greed. Do not imagine it is any trouble to us to work miracles. Suppose we leave out of consideration the disciples of Gotama the ascetic: if we like, we too will show our Supernormal Powers with the ascetic Gotama himself: if the ascetic Gotama works one miracle, we will work one twice as good.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The monks who heard this told the Fortunate One of it, &ldquo;Sir, the schismatics say they will work a miracle.&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Let them do it, monks; I will do the like.&rdquo; Bimbisāra, hearing this, went and asked the Fortunate One, &ldquo;Will you work a miracle, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, O king.&rdquo; &ldquo;Was there not a command given on this matter, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;The command, O king, was given to my disciples; there is no command which can rule the Buddhas. When the flowers and fruit in your park are forbidden to others, the same rule does not apply to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then where will you work this miracle, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;At Sāvatthi, under Gaṇḍa&rsquo;s mango tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;What have I to do, then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing, sire.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Next day, after breaking his fast, the Teacher went to seek alms. &ldquo;Whither goes the Teacher?&rdquo; asked the people. The monks answered to them, &ldquo;At the gate of the city of Sāvatthi, beneath Gaṇḍa&rsquo;s mango tree, he is to work a twofold miracle to the confounding of the schismatics.&rdquo; The crowd said: &ldquo;This miracle will be what they call a masterpiece; we will go see it,&rdquo; leaving the doors of their houses, they went along with the Teacher. Some of the schismatics also followed the Teacher, with their disciples, &ldquo;We too,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;will work a miracle, in the place where the ascetic Gotama shall work his.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">By and by the Teacher arrived at Sāvatthi. The king asked him, &ldquo;Is it true, sir, you are about to work a miracle, as they say?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it is true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;On the seventh day from now, at the full moon of the month of July.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shall I set up a pavilion, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Peace, great king: in the place where I shall work my miracle Sakka will set up a pavilion of jewels twelve leagues in compass.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shall I proclaim this thing through the city, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Proclaim it, O king.&rdquo; The king sent forth the announcer of the Dhamma on an elephant richly caparisoned, to proclaim thus, &ldquo;News! The Teacher is about to perform a miracle, for the confounding of the schismatics, at the Gate of Sāvatthi, under Gaṇḍa&rsquo;s mango tree, seven days from now!&rdquo; Each day was this proclamation made. When the schismatics heard this news, that the miracle will be done under Gaṇḍa&rsquo;s mango tree, they had all the mango trees near to Sāvatthi cut down, paying the owners for them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">On the night of the full moon the announcer of the Dhamma made proclamation, &ldquo;This day in the morning the miracle will take place.&rdquo; By the power of the gods it was as though all Jambudīpa was at the door and heard the proclamation; whosoever had it in his heart to go, they all betook themselves to Sāvatthi: for twelve leagues the crowd extended.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Early in the morning the Teacher went on his rounds seeking alms. The king&rsquo;s gardener, Gaṇḍa by name, was just taking to the king a fine ripe mango fruit; thoroughly ripe, big as a bushel, when he espied the Teacher at the city gate. &ldquo;This fruit is worthy of the Tathāgata,&rdquo; said he, and gave it to him. The Teacher took it, and sitting down then and there on one side, ate the fruit. When it was eaten, he said: &ldquo;Ānanda, give the gardener this stone to plant here on the spot; this shall be Gaṇḍa&rsquo;s mango tree.&rdquo; The elder did so.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The gardener dug a hole in the earth, and planted it. On the</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t34">instant the stone burst, roots sprouted forth, up sprang a red shoot tall as a plough-pole; even as the crowd stared it grew into a mango tree of a hundred cubits, with a trunk fifty cubits and branches of fifty cubits in height; at the same time flowers bloomed, fruit ripened; the tree stood filling the sky, covered with bees, laden with golden fruit; when the wind blew on it, sweet fruits fell; then the monks came up and ate of the fruit, and retired.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">In the evening time the King of the Devas, reflecting, perceived that it was a task laid on him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things. So he sent the Devaputta Vissakamma, and caused him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things, twelve leagues in compass, covered all over with blue lotus. Thus the gods of ten thousand spheres were gathered together. The Teacher, for the confounding of the schismatics having performed a twofold miracle passing marvellous among his disciples, caused faith to spring up in multitudes, then arose and, sitting in the Buddha&rsquo;s seat, declared the Dhamma. Twenty crores of beings drank of the waters of life. Then, meditating to see whither it was that former Buddhas went when they had done a miracle, and perceiving that it was to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, up he rose from the Buddha&rsquo;s seat, the right foot he placed on the top of Mount Yugandhara, and with his left strode to the peak of Sineru, he began the Rains Retreat under the great Coral Tree, seated upon the yellow-stone throne; for the space of three months he discoursed upon the Abhidhamma to the gods.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The people knew not the place whither the Teacher had gone; they looked, and said: &ldquo;Let us go home,&rdquo; and lived in that place during the rainy season. When the rainy season was near to its end, and the feast was at hand, the great elder Moggallāna went and announced it to the Fortunate One. Thereupon the Teacher asked him, &ldquo;Where is Sāriputta now?&rdquo; &ldquo;He, sir, after the miracle which delighted him, remained with five hundred monks in the city of Saṅkassa, and is there still.&rdquo; &ldquo;Moggallāna, on the seventh day from now I shall descend by the gate of Saṅkassa. Let those who desire to behold the Tathāgata assemble in the city of Saṅkassa.&rdquo; The elder assented, went and told the people: the whole company he transported from Sāvatthi to Saṅkassa, a distance of thirty leagues, in the twinkling of an eye.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Rains Retreat over, and the Invitation celebrated, the Teacher told king Sakka that he was about to return to the world of men. Then Sakka sent for Vissakamma, and said to him, &ldquo;Make a stairway for the One with Ten Powers to descend into the world of men.&rdquo; He placed the head of the stairway upon the peak of Sineru, and the foot of it by the gate of Saṅkassa, and between he made three stairways side by side: one of gems, one of silver, and one of gold: the balustrade and cornice were of the seven things of price. The Teacher, having performed a miracle for the world&rsquo;s emancipation, descended by the midmost stair made out of gems. Sakka carried the bowl and robe, Suyāma a yak&rsquo;s-tail fan, Brahmā Lord of all beings bore a sunshade, and the deities of the ten thousand spheres worshipped with divine garlands and perfumes. When the Teacher stood at the foot of the staircase, first elder Sāriputta gave him greeting, afterwards the rest of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Amidst this assembly the Teacher thought: &ldquo;Moggallāna has been shown to possess supernatural power, Upāli as one who is versed in the sacred law, but the quality of high wisdom possessed by Sāriputta has not been shown. Save and except me, no other possesses wisdom so full and complete as his; I will make known the quality of his wisdom.&rdquo; First of all he asked a question which is put to ordinary persons, and the ordinary persons answered it. Then he asked a question within the scope of those of the First Path, and this they of the First Path answered, but the ordinary folk knew nought of it. In the same way he asked questions in turn within the scope of those of the Second and Third Paths, of the Arahats, of the chief disciples; and in each case those who were below each grade in turn were unable to answer, but they who were above could answer. Then he put a question within the power of Sāriputta, and this the elder could answer, but the others not so. The people asked, &ldquo;Who is this elder who answered the Teacher?&rdquo; They were told, it was the Captain of the Dhamma, and Sāriputta was his name. &ldquo;Ah, great is his wisdom!&rdquo; they said. Ever afterwards the quality of the elder&rsquo;s great wisdom was known to men and to gods. Then the Teacher said to him,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">&ldquo;Some have probations yet to pass, and some have reached the goal:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">Their different behaviours say, for you do know the whole.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t34">Having thus asked a question which comes within a Buddha&rsquo;s scope, he added, &ldquo;Here is a point put with brevity, Sāriputta; what is the meaning of the matter in all its bearings?&rdquo; The elder considered the problem. He thought: &ldquo;The Teacher asks of the proper behaviour with which the monks attain progress, both those who are in the lower Paths and those who are Arahats?&rdquo; As to the general question, he had no doubt. But then he considered, &ldquo;The proper manner of behaviour may be described in many ways of speaking according to the essential elements of being, and so forth from that beginning; now in what fashion can I hit the Teacher&rsquo;s meaning?&rdquo; He was doubtful about the meaning. The Teacher thought: &ldquo;Sāriputta has no doubt of the general question, but doubts what particular side of it I have in view. If I give no clue, he will never be able to answer, so a clue I will give him.&rdquo; This clue he gave by saying: &ldquo;See here, Sāriputta: you grant this to be true?&rdquo; (mentioning some point). Sāriputta granted the point.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The hint thus given, he knew that Sāriputta had taken his meaning, and would answer fully, starting from the very elements of being. Then the question stood out clear before the elder, as with a hundred hints, nay, a thousand; and he, at the Teacher&rsquo;s hint given, answered the question which belonged to a Buddha&rsquo;s scope.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, <span class="t11">the Bodhisatta was born a northern brahmin and completed his education at Taxila. Putting sensual desires from him and renouncing the world for the ascetic&rsquo;s life, he won the five </span>Super Knowledges<span class="t11"> and eight Attainments, and dwelt in the Himālayas, where five hundred ascetics gathered round him. One rainy season, his chief disciple went with half the ascetics to the haunts of men to get salt and vinegar. And that was the time when the Bodhisatta should die. And his disciples, wishing to know his spiritual attainment, said to him, &ldquo;What excellence have you won?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta, as he expired in his forest-home, exclaimed, &ldquo;Moonlight and Sunlight.&rdquo; With these words he died and passed to the Radiant Realm.</p>
<p class="p7">Now when the chief disciple interpreted the Teacher&rsquo;s words his fellows did not believe him. Then back came the Bodhisatta and from mid-air and recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Candābhaṁ sūriyābhañ-ca, yodha paññāya gādhati.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Avitakkena jhānena hoti Ābhassarūpago ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">He who, with wisdom, is well grounded in the moon&rsquo;s or sun&rsquo;s lustre, through absorption, without thinking, will go to the Radiant Realm.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Such was the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s teaching, and, first praising his disciple, he went his way back to the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2925"></a><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Sāriputta was the chief disciple of those days, and I Mahābrahmā.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a2929"></a><span class="t15">In the present one nun is greedy and spoils things for the other nuns, and annoys the monks and lay people also. The Buddha tells a story of how, in a previous life, she had tried to pluck the golden feathers of her previous husband, and had lost the advantage she had.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a2930"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the golden goose king (suvaṇṇahaṁsarājā),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;You should be content with what is received.&rdquo;</span><a id="a2933"></a><a id="a2934"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher about a nun named Thullanandā.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2935"></a><span class="t30">A lay brother at Sāvatthi had offered the nuns a supply of garlic, and, sending for his bailiff; had given orders that, if they should come, each nun was to receive two or three handfuls. After that they made a practice </span><span class="t18">{1.475}</span><span class="t30"> of coming </span><a id="a2936"></a><span class="t18">[1.293]</span><a id="a2937"></a><span class="t30"> to his house or field for their garlic. Now one holiday the supply of garlic in the house ran out, and the nun Thullanandā, coming with others to the house, was told, when she said she wanted some garlic, that there was none left in the house, it had all been used up out of hand, and that she must go to the field for it. So away to the field she went and carried off an excessive amount of garlic. The bailiff grew angry and remarked what a greedy lot these nuns were! This piqued the more moderate nuns; and the monks too were piqued at the taunt when the nuns repeated it to them, and they told the Fortunate One. Rebuking the greed of Thullanandā, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, a greedy person is harsh and unkind even to the mother who bore him; a greedy person cannot convert the unconverted, or make the converted grow in grace, or cause alms to come in, or save them when come in; whereas the moderate person can do all these things.&rdquo; In such wise did the Teacher point the moral, ending by saying: &ldquo;Monks, as Thullanandā is greedy now, so she was greedy in times gone by.&rdquo; And thereupon he told the following story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a brahmin, and growing up was married to a bride of his own rank, who bore him three daughters named Nandā, Nandavatī and Sundarinandā. The Bodhisatta dying, they were taken in by neighbours and friends, while he was born again into the world as a golden mallard endowed with consciousness of its former existences. Growing up, the bird viewed its own magnificent size and golden plumage, and remembered that previously it had been a human being. Discovering that his wife and daughters were living on the generosity of others, the mallard bethought him of his plumage like hammered and beaten gold and how by giving them a golden feather at a time he could enable his wife and daughters to live in comfort. So away he flew to where they dwelt and alighted on the top of the central beam of the roof.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2938"></a>Seeing the Bodhisatta, <span class="t18">{1.476}</span> the wife and girls asked where he had come from; and he told them that he was their father who had died and been born a golden mallard, and that he had come to visit them and put an end to their miserable necessity of working for hire. &ldquo;You shall have my feathers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;one by one, and they will sell for enough to keep you all in ease and comfort.&rdquo; So saying, he gave them one of his feathers and departed. And from time to time he returned to give them another feather, and with the proceeds of their sale these brahmin women grew prosperous and quite well-to-do.</p>
<p class="p7">But one day the mother said to her daughters, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no trusting animals, my children. Who&rsquo;s to say your father might not go away one of these days and never come back again? Let us use our time and pluck him clean next time he comes, so as to make sure of all his feathers.&rdquo; Thinking this would pain him, the daughters refused. The mother in her greed called the golden mallard to her one day when he came, and then took him with both hands and plucked him. Now the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s feathers had this property that if <a id="a2939"></a><span class="t18">[1.294]</span> they were plucked out against his wish, they ceased to be golden and became like a crane&rsquo;s feathers. And now the poor bird, though he stretched his wings, could not fly, and the woman flung him into a barrel and gave him food there. As time went on his feathers grew again (though they were plain white ones now), and he flew away to his own abode and never came back again.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At the close of this story the Teacher said: &ldquo;Thus you see, monks, how Thullanandā was as greedy in times past as she is now. And her greed then lost her the gold in the same way as her greed now will lose her the garlic. Observe, moreover, how her greed has deprived all the nuns of their supply of garlic, and learn therefrom to be moderate in your desires and to be content with what is given you, however small that may be.&rdquo; So saying, he uttered this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Yaṁ laddhaṁ tena tuṭṭhabbaṁ, atilobho hi pāpako,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Haṁsarājaṁ gahetvāna, suvaṇṇā parihāyathā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">You should be content with what is received, the wicked have great greed, after grabbing ahold of the king of geese, the gold must decline.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a2940"></a><span class="t30">So saying, the Teacher soundly rebuked the erring nun and laid down the precept that any nun who should eat garlic would have to do penance. Then, </span><span class="t18">{1.477}</span><span class="t30"> making the connection, he said: &ldquo;Thullanandā was the brahmin&rsquo;s wife of the story, her three sisters were the brahmin&rsquo;s three daughters, and I myself the golden mallard.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a2944"></a><span class="t15">In the present a married daughter visits her mother and is importuned so long she loses her husband. The Buddha tells how a mouse in the past had to share her meat with four cats, until she found a way to dispense with them.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the stone cutter (pāsāṇakoṭṭakamaṇikāra),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Kāṇa&rsquo;s mother = the mouse (mūsika),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the four monks = the four cats (cattāro biḷārā).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Where one cat receives.&rdquo;</span><a id="a2946"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the precept respecting Kāṇā&rsquo;s mother. She was a lay-sister at Sāvatthi known only as Kāṇā&rsquo;s mother, who had entered the Paths of emancipation and was of the disciples. Her daughter Kāṇā</span><a id="a2947"></a><a href="notes.html#a14956"><span class="t9">{351}</span></a><span class="t30"> was married to a husband of the same caste in another village, and some errand or other made her go to see her mother. A few days went by, and her husband sent a messenger to say he wished her to come back. The girl asked her mother whether she should go, and the mother said she could not go back empty-handed after so long an absence, and set about making a cake. Just then up came a monk going his round for alms, and the mother sat him down to the cake she had just baked. Away he went </span><a id="a2948"></a><span class="t18">[1.295]</span><span class="t30"> and told another monk, who came up just in time to get the second cake that was baked for the daughter to take home with her. He told a third, and the third told a fourth, and so each fresh cake was taken by a fresh comer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The result of this was that the daughter did not start on her way home, and the husband sent a second and a third messenger after her. And the message he sent by the third was that if his wife did not come back, he should get another wife. And each message had exactly the same result. So the husband took another wife, and at the news his former wife fell weeping. Knowing all this, the Teacher put on his robes early in the morning and went with his alms-bowl to the house of Kāṇā&rsquo;s mother and sat down on the seat set for him. Then he asked why the daughter was crying, and, being told, spoke words of consolation to the mother, and arose and went back to the monastery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now the monks came to know how Kāṇā had been stopped three times from going back to her husband owing to the action of the four monks; and one day they met in the Dhamma Hall and began to talk about the matter. The Teacher came into the Hall </span><span class="t18">{1.478}</span><span class="t30"> and asked what they were discussing, and they told him. &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;think not this is the first time those four monks have brought sorrow on Kāṇā&rsquo;s mother by eating of her store; they did the like in days gone by too.&rdquo; So saying he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a stone-cutter, and growing up became expert in working stones. Now in the Kāsi country there dwelt a very rich merchant who had amassed forty crores in gold. And when his wife died, so strong was her love of money that she was reborn a mouse and dwelt over the treasure. And one by one the whole family died, including the merchant himself. Likewise the village became deserted and forlorn.</p>
<p class="p7">At the time of our story the Bodhisatta was quarrying and shaping stones on the site of this deserted village; and the mouse used often to see him as she ran about to find food. At last she fell in love with him; and, bethinking her how the secret of all her vast wealth would die with her, she conceived the idea of enjoying it with him. So one day she came to the Bodhisatta with a coin in her mouth. Seeing this, he spoke to her kindly, and said: &ldquo;Mother, what has brought you here with this coin?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is for you to lay out for yourself, and to buy meat with for me as well, my son.&rdquo; Nowise reluctant, he took the money and spent a halfpenny of it on meat which he brought to the mouse, who departed and ate to her heart&rsquo;s content. And this went on, the mouse giving the Bodhisatta a coin every day, and he in return supplying her with meat. But it fell out one day that the mouse was caught by a cat.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me,&rdquo; said the mouse. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the cat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as hungry as can be, and really must kill you to allay the pangs.&rdquo; &ldquo;First, tell me whether you&rsquo;re always hungry, or only hungry today.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, every day finds me hungry again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then, if this be so, I will find you always in meat; <span class="t18">{1.479}</span> only let me go.&rdquo;<a id="a2949"></a><span class="t18"> [1.296]</span> &ldquo;Mind you do then,&rdquo; said the cat, and let the mouse go.</p>
<p class="p7">As a consequence of this the mouse had to divide the supplies of meat she got from the Bodhisatta into two portions and gave one half to the cat, keeping the other for herself.</p>
<p class="p7">Now, as luck would have it, the same mouse was caught another day by a second cat and had to purchase her release on the same terms. So now the daily food was divided into three portions. And when a third cat caught the mouse and a like arrangement had to be made, the supply was divided into four portions. And later a fourth cat caught her, and the food had to be divided among five, so that the mouse, reduced to such short rations, grew so thin as to be nothing but skin and bone. Remarking how emaciated his friend was getting, the Bodhisatta asked the reason. Then the mouse told him all that had befallen her.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me all this before?&rdquo; said, the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;Cheer up, I&rsquo;ll help you out of your troubles.&rdquo; So he took a block of the purest crystal and scooped out a cavity in it and made the mouse get inside. &ldquo;Now stop there,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t fail to fiercely threaten and revile all who come near.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So the mouse crept into the crystal cell and waited. Up came one of the cats and demanded his meat. &ldquo;Away, vile grimalkin,&rdquo; said the mouse, &ldquo;why should I supply you? Go home and eat your kittens!&rdquo; Infuriated at these words, and never suspecting the mouse to be inside the crystal, the cat sprang at the mouse to eat her up; and so furious was its spring that it broke the walls of its chest and its eyes started from its head. So that cat died and its carcase tumbled down out of sight. And the like fate in turn befell all four cats. And ever after the grateful mouse brought the Bodhisatta two or three coins instead of one as before, and by degrees she thus gave him the whole of the hoard. In unbroken friendship the two lived together, till their lives ended and they passed away to fare according to their deeds.</p>
<p class="p7">The story told, the Buddha, uttered this verse: <span class="t18">{1.480}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Yattheko labhate babbu, dutiyo tattha jāyati,</span></p>

The incidents were like those above related.</span><a id="a2957"></a><a href="notes.html#a14958"><span class="t9">{352}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2958"></a><a id="a2959"></a><span class="t34">This man, even though dedicated to the dispensation that leads to safety, notwithstanding to gain life&rsquo;s necessaries fulfilled the threefold cheating practice [seeking requisites, seeking honour and hinting].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The monks brought to light all the evil parts in the man as they conversed together in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Such a one, monks, after he had dedicated himself to this dispensation which leads to safety, yet lives in deceit!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and asked what they talked of there. They told him. Said he, &ldquo;This is not now the first time; he was deceitful before,&rdquo; and so saying he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2960"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a lizard; and in a hut nearby a village on the borders there lived a rigid ascetic who had attained the five Super Knowledges, and was treated with great respect by the villagers. In an ant-hill at the end of the walk where the recluse paced up and down, dwelt the Bodhisatta, and twice or thrice each day he would go to the recluse and hear words of edification and holiness. Then with due obeisance to the good man, the Bodhisatta would depart to his own abode.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2961"></a>After a certain time the ascetic bade farewell to the villagers and went away. In his stead there came another ascetic, a rascally fellow, to dwell in the hermitage. Assuming the holiness of the newcomer, the Bodhisatta acted towards him as to the first ascetic. One day an unexpected storm in the dry season brought out the ants on their hills, and the lizards, coming abroad to eat them, were caught in great numbers <span class="t18">{1.481}</span> by the village folk; and some were served up with vinegar and sugar for the ascetic to eat. Pleased with so savoury a dish, he asked what it was, and learned that it was a dish of lizards. Hereon he reflected that he had a remarkably fine lizard as his neighbour, and resolved to dine off him. Accordingly he made ready the pot for cooking and sauce to serve the lizard in, and sat at the door of his hut with a mallet hidden under his yellow robe, awaiting the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s coming, with a studied air of perfect peace.</p>
<p class="p7">At evening the Bodhisatta came, and as he drew near, marked that the ascetic did not seem quite the same, but had a look about him that boded no good. Snuffing up the wind which was blowing towards him from the ascetic&rsquo;s cell, the Bodhisatta smelt the smell of lizard&rsquo;s flesh, and at once realised how the taste of lizard had made the ascetic want to kill him with a mallet and eat him up. So he retired homeward without calling on the ascetic. Seeing that the Bodhisatta did not come, the ascetic judged that the lizard must have divined his plot, but marvelled how he could have discovered it. Determined that the lizard should not escape, he drew out the mallet and threw <a id="a2962"></a><span class="t18">[1.298]</span> it, just hitting the tip of the lizard&rsquo;s tail. Quick as thought the Bodhisatta dashed into his fastness, and putting his head out by a different hole to that by which he had gone in, cried, &ldquo;You deceitful person, your garb of piety led me to trust you, but now I know your villainous nature. What has a thief like you to do with ascetic&rsquo;s clothing?&rdquo; Thus upbraiding the false ascetic, the Bodhisatta recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Kiṁ te jaṭāhi dummedha? Kiṁ te ajinasāṭiyā?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Abbhantaraṁ te gahanaṁ, bāhiraṁ parimajjasī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Why, fool, do you have matted hair? Why do you have antelope&rsquo;s skin? You are a thicket on the inside, but polished on the outside. </span><span class="t18">{1.482}</span></p>
<p class="p23">In this wise did the Bodhisatta expose the wicked ascetic, after which he retired into his ant-hill. And the wicked ascetic departed from that place.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The deceitful person was the wicked ascetic of those days, Sāriputta the good ascetic who lived in the hermitage before him, and I myself the lizard.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks are talking about Devadatta&rsquo;s twofold failure, as a monk and as a layman. The Buddha tells of a fisherman who lost his eyes while his wife got a beating by trying to hide their good luck.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the Tree Devatā (Rukkhadevatā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a2967"></a><span class="t15">Devadatta = the fishermen (bāḷisika).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a2968"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Dissemblance, Misfortune, Devas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Eyes are blinded, and clothes are lost.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta. We hear that the monks, meeting together in the Dhamma Hall, spoke one with another, saying that even as a torch from a pyre, charred at both ends and bedunged in the middle, does not serve as wood either in forest tree or village-hearth, so Devadatta by giving up the world to follow this dispensation which leads to safety had only achieved a twofold shortcoming and failure, seeing that he had missed the comforts of a lay life yet had fallen short of his vocation as a monk.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Entering the Hall, the Teacher asked and was told what the monks were talking of together. &ldquo;Yes, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and so too in days gone by Devadatta came to just such another two-fold failure.&rdquo; So saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a Tree Devatā, and there was a certain village where <a id="a2969"></a><span class="t18">[1.299]</span> fishermen dwelt in those days. And one of these fishermen taking his tackle went off with his little boy, and cast his hook into the most likely waters known to his fellow-fishermen. Now <span class="t18">{1.483}</span> a snag caught his hook and the fisherman could not pull it up. &ldquo;What a fine fish!&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better send my boy off home to my wife and tell her to get up a quarrel and keep the others at home, so that there&rsquo;ll be none to want to go shares in my prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Accordingly he told the lad to run off home and tell his mother what a big fish he had hooked and how she was to engage the neighbours&rsquo; attention. Then, fearing his line might break, he flung off his coat and dashed into the water to secure his prize. But as he groped about for the fish, he struck against the snag and put out both his eyes. Moreover a robber stole his clothes from the bank. In an agony of pain, with his hands pressed to his blinded eyes, he clambered out trembling in every limb and tried to find his clothes.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2970"></a>Meantime his wife, to occupy the neighbours by a quarrel on purpose, had tricked herself out with a palm-leaf behind one ear, and had blacked one eye with soot from the saucepan. In this guise, nursing a dog, she came out to call on her neighbours. &ldquo;Bless me, you&rsquo;ve gone mad,&rdquo; said one woman to her. &ldquo;Not mad at all,&rdquo; retorted the fisherman&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;you abuse me without cause with your slanderous tongue. Come your ways with me to the village headman and I&rsquo;ll have you fined eight pieces<a id="a2971"></a><a href="notes.html#a14960"><span class="t9">{353}</span></a> for slander.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So with angry words they went off to the village headman. But when the matter was gone into, it was the fisherman&rsquo;s wife who was fined; and she was tied up and beaten to make her pay the fine. Now when the Tree Devatā saw how misfortune had befallen both the wife in the village and the husband in the forest, he stood in the fork of his tree and exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah fisherman, both in the water and on land your labour is in vain, and twofold is your failure.&rdquo; So saying he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Akkhī bhinnā, paṭo naṭṭho, sakhigehe ca bhaṇḍanaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ubhato paduṭṭhā kammantā, udakamhi thalamhi cā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Eyes are blinded, and clothes are lost, accusations in a friend&rsquo;s house, both of their doings are wicked, in the water and on dry land. </span><span class="t18">{1.484}</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Devadatta was the fisherman of those days, and I the Tree Devatā.&rdquo;</span></p>

The incidents will be related in the twelfth book in connection with the Bhaddasālajātaka [Ja 465].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2980"></a><span class="t34">Now at this time there lived close to the gate a Licchavi named Mahāli, who had been educated by the same teacher as the king of Kosala&rsquo;s general, Bandhula. This man was blind, and used to advise the Licchavis on all matters temporal and spiritual. Hearing the clatter of the chariot as it went over the threshold, he said: &ldquo;The noise of the chariot of Bandhula the Mallian! This day there will be fear for the Licchavis!&rdquo; By the tank there was set a strong guard, within and without; above it was spread an iron net; not even a bird could find room to get through. But the general, dismounting from his carriage, put the guards to flight with the blows of his sword, and burst through the iron network, and in the tank bathed his wife and gave her to drink of the water; then after bathing himself, he set Mallikā in the chariot, and left the town, and went back by the way he came.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The guards went and told all to the Licchavis. Then were the kings of the Licchavis angry; and five hundred of them, mounted in five hundred chariots, departed to capture Bandhula the Mallian. They informed Mahāli of it, and he said: &ldquo;Go not! For he will slay you all.&rdquo; But they said: &ldquo;Nay, but we will go.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then if you come to a place where a wheel has sunk up to the nave, you must return. If you return not then, return back from that place when you hear the noise of a thunderbolt. If then you turn not, turn back from that place where you shall see a hole in front of your chariots. Go no further!&rdquo; But they did not turn back according to his word, but pursued on and on.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Mallikā espied them and said: &ldquo;There are chariots in sight, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then tell me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when they all look like one chariot.&rdquo; When they all in a line looked like one, she said: &ldquo;My lord, I see as it were the head of one chariot.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take the reins, then,&rdquo; said he, and gave the reins into her hand: he stood upright in the chariot, and strung his bow. The chariot-wheel sank into the earth nave-deep. The Licchavis came to the place, and saw it, but turned not back. The other went on a little further, and twanged the bow string; then came a noise as the noise of a thunderbolt, yet even then they turned not, but pursued on and on. Bandhula stood up in the chariot and sped a shaft, and it cleft the heads of all the five hundred chariots, and passed right through the five hundred kings in the place where the girdle is fastened, and then buried itself in the earth. As they did not perceive that they were wounded they pursued still, shouting, &ldquo;Stop, holloa, stop!&rdquo; Bandhula stopped his chariot, and said: &ldquo;You are dead men, and I cannot fight with the dead.&rdquo; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;dead, such as we now are?&rdquo; &ldquo;Loose the girdle of the first man,&rdquo; said Bandhula.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">They loosed his girdle, and at the instant the girdle was loosed, he fell dead. Then he said to them, &ldquo;You are all of you in the same condition: go to your homes, and set in order what should be ordered, and give your directions to your wives and families, and then doff your armour.&rdquo; They did so, and then all of them gave up the ghost.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">And Bandhula conveyed Mallikā to Sāvatthi. She bore twin sons sixteen times in succession, and they were all mighty men and heroes, and became perfected in all manner of accomplishments. Each one of them had a thousand</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t34">men to attend him, and when they went with their father to wait on the king, they alone filled the courtyard of the palace to overflowing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">One day some men who had been defeated in court on a false charge, seeing Bandhula approach, raised a great outcry, and informed him that the judges of the court had supported a false charge. So Bandhula went into the court, and judged the case, and gave each man his own. The crowd uttered loud shouts of applause. The king asked what it meant, and on hearing was much pleased; all those officers he sent away, and gave Bandhula charge of the judgement court, and thenceforward he judged aright. Then the former judges became poor, because they no longer received bribes, and they slandered Bandhula in the king&rsquo;s ear, accusing him of aiming at the kingdom himself. The king listened to their words, and could not control his suspicions. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;if he be slain here, I shall be blamed.&rdquo; He instigated certain men to harry the frontier districts; then sending for Bandhula, he said: &ldquo;The borders are in a blaze; go with your sons and capture the brigands.&rdquo; With him he also sent other men sufficient, mighty men of war, with instructions to kill him and his two-and-thirty sons, and cut off their heads, and bring them back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">While he was yet on the way, the hired brigands got wind of the general&rsquo;s coming, and took to flight. He settled the people of that district in their homes, and quieted the province, and set out for home. Then when he was not far from the city, those warriors cut off his head and the heads of his sons.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a crow. One day the king&rsquo;s family priest went out from the city to the river, bathed there, and having perfumed and garlanded himself, donned his bravest array and came back to the city. On the archway of the city gate there sat two crows; and one of them said to his mate, &ldquo;I mean to foul on this brahmin&rsquo;s head.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t do any such thing,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;for this brahmin is a great man, and it is an evil thing to incur the hatred of the great. If you anger him, he may destroy the whole of our kind.&rdquo; &ldquo;I really must,&rdquo; said the first. &ldquo;Very well, you&rsquo;re sure to be found out,&rdquo; said the other, and flew quickly away. Just when the brahmin was under the battlements, down dropped the filth upon him as if the crow were dropping a festoon. The enraged brahmin forthwith conceived a hatred against all crows.</p>
<p class="p7">Now at this time it chanced that a female slave in charge of a granary spread the rice out in the sun at the granary door and was sitting there to watch it, when she fell asleep. Just then up came a shaggy goat and fell to eating the rice till the girl woke up and drove it away. Twice or three times the goat came back, as soon as she fell asleep, and ate the rice. <span class="t18">{1.485}</span> So when she had driven the creature away for the third time she bethought her that continued visits of the goat would consume half her store of rice and that steps must be taken to scare the animal away for good and so save her from so great a loss. So she took a lighted torch, and, sitting down, pretended to fall asleep as usual. And when the goat was eating, she suddenly sprang up and hit its shaggy back with her torch. At once the goat&rsquo;s shaggy hide was all ablaze, and to ease its pain, it dashed into a hay-shed near the elephant&rsquo;s stable and rolled in the hay. So the shed caught fire and the flames spread to the stables. As these stables caught fire, the elephants began to suffer, and many of them were badly burnt beyond the skill of the elephant-doctors to cure. When this <a id="a2981"></a><span class="t18">[1.301]</span> was reported to the king, he asked his family priest whether he knew what would cure the elephants. &ldquo;Certainly I do, sire,&rdquo; said the family priest, and being pressed to explain, said his cure was crows&rsquo; fat. Then the king ordered crows to be killed and their fat taken. And forthwith there was a great slaughter of crows, but never was any fat found on them, and so they went on killing till dead crows lay in heaps everywhere. And a great fear was upon all crows.</p>
<p class="p7">Now in those days the Bodhisatta had his dwelling in a great cemetery, at the head of eighty thousand crows. One of these brought tidings to him of the fear that was upon the crows. And the Bodhisatta, feeling that there was none but him who could essay the task, resolved to free his kinsfolk from their great dread. Reviewing the Ten Perfections, and selecting therefrom Loving-Kindness as his guide, he flew without stopping right up to the king&rsquo;s palace, and entering in at the open window alighted underneath the king&rsquo;s throne. Straightaway a servant tried to catch the bird, but the king entering the chamber forbade him.</p>
<p class="p7">Recovering himself in a moment, the Great Being, remembering Loving-Kindness, came forth from beneath the king&rsquo;s throne and spoke thus to the king; &ldquo;Sire, a king should remember the maxim that kings should not walk according to lust and other evil passions in ruling their kingdoms. Before taking action, it is meet first to examine and know the whole matter, and then only to do that which being done is salutary. If kings do that which being done is not salutary, they fill thousands with a great fear, even the fear of death. <span class="t18">{1.486}</span> And in prescribing crows&rsquo; fat, your family priest was prompted by revenge to lie; for crows have no fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">By these words the king&rsquo;s heart was won, and he bade the Bodhisatta be set on a throne of gold and there anointed beneath the wings with the choicest oils and served in vessels of gold with the king&rsquo;s own meats and drink. Then when the Great Being was filled and at ease, the king said: &ldquo;Sage, you say that crows have no fat. How comes it that they have none?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;In this wise,&rdquo; answered the Bodhisatta with a voice that filled the whole palace, and he proclaimed the Dhamma in this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Niccaṁ ubbiggahadayā, sabbalokavihesakā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tasmā nesaṁ vasā natthi, kākānamhāka ñātinan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Always frantic in heart, troubled by the whole world, therefore they have no fat, our relatives the crows.</span></p>
<p class="p23">This explanation given, the Great Being taught the king, saying: &ldquo;Sire, kings should never act without examining and knowing the whole matter.&rdquo; Well pleased, the king laid his kingdom at the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s feet, but the Bodhisatta restored it to the king, whom he established in the Five Precepts, beseeching him to shield all living creatures from harm. And the king was moved by these words to grant immunity to all living <a id="a2982"></a><span class="t18">[1.302]</span> creatures, and in particular he was unceasingly bountiful to crows. Every day he had six bushels of rice cooked for them and delicately flavoured, and this was given to the crows. But to the Great Being there was given food such as the king alone ate.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Ānanda was king of Benares in those days, and I myself the king of the crows.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Associating with the wicked.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {1.487}</span><a id="a2991"></a><a id="a2992"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about a traitorous monk. The introductory incident is the same as that told in the Mahilāmukhajātaka [Ja 26].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta, who, having secured the adherence of prince Ajātasattu, had attained both gain and honour. Prince Ajātasattu had a monastery built for Devadatta at Gayāsīsa, and every day brought to him five hundred pots of perfumed three-year-old rice flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. All this gain and honour brought Devadatta a great following, with whom Devadatta lived on, without ever stirring out of his monastery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At that time there were living in Rājagaha two friends, of whom one had taken the vows under the Teacher, while the other had taken them under Devadatta. And these continued to see one another, either casually or by visiting the monasteries. Now one day the disciple of Devadatta said to the other, &ldquo;Sir, why do you daily go round for alms with the sweat streaming off you? Devadatta sits quietly at Gayāsīsa and feeds on the best of fare, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. There&rsquo;s no way like his. Why create misery for yourself? Why should it not be a good thing for you to come the first thing in the morning to the monastery at Gayāsīsa and there drink our rice-gruel with a relish after it, try our eighteen kinds of solid victuals, and enjoy our excellent soft food, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Being pressed time after time to accept the invitation, the other began to want to go, and thenceforth used to go to Gayāsīsa and there eat and eat, not forgetting however to return to the Bamboo Grove at the proper hour. Nevertheless he could not keep it secret always; and in a little while it came out that he used to go to Gayāsīsa and there regale himself with the food provided for Devadatta. Accordingly, his friends asked him, saying: &ldquo;Is it true, as they say, that you regale yourself on the food provided for Devadatta?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;So-and-so said it.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true, sirs, that I go to Gayāsīsa and eat there. But it is not Devadatta who gives me food; others do that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, Devadatta is the foe of the Buddhas; in his wickedness, he has secured the adherence of Ajātasattu and by unrighteousness got gain and honour for himself. Yet you who have taken the vows according to this dispensation which leads to safety, eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness. Come; let us bring you before the Teacher.&rdquo; And, taking with them the monk, they went to the Dhamma Hall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When the Teacher became aware of their presence, he said: &ldquo;Monks, are you bringing this monk here against his will?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir; this monk, after taking the vows under you, eats the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it true, as they say, that you eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness?&rdquo; &ldquo;It was not Devadatta, sir, that gave it me, but others.&rdquo; &ldquo;Raise no quibbles here, monk,&rdquo; said the Teacher. &ldquo;Devadatta is a man of bad conduct and bad principle. Oh, how could you, who have taken the vows in the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation, eat Devadatta&rsquo;s food, while living in the Teacher&rsquo;s presence? But you have always been prone to being led away, and have followed in turn every one you meet.&rdquo; And, so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born an iguana. When he grew up he dwelt in a big burrow in the river bank with a following of many hundreds of other iguanas. Now the Bodhisatta had a son, a young iguana, who was great friends with a chameleon, whom he used to clip and embrace. This intimacy being reported to the iguana king, he sent for his young son and said that such friendship was misplaced, for chameleons were low creatures, and that if the intimacy was persisted in, calamity would befall the whole of the tribe of iguanas. And he enjoined his son to have no more to do with the chameleon. But the son continued in his intimacy. Again and again did the Bodhisatta speak with his son, but finding his words of no avail, and foreseeing danger to the iguanas from the chameleon, he had an outlet cut on one side of their burrow, so that there might be a means of escape in time of need.</p>
<p class="p7">Now as time went on, the young iguana grew to a great size, while the chameleon never grew any bigger. And as these mountainous embraces of the young giant grew painful indeed, the chameleon foresaw <a id="a2993"></a><span class="t18">[1.303]</span> that they would be the death of him if they went on a few days longer, and he resolved to combine with a hunter to destroy the whole tribe of iguanas.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2994"></a>One day in the summer the ants came out after a thunder-storm,<a id="a2995"></a><a href="notes.html#a14962"><span class="t9">{354}</span></a> and <span class="t18">{1.488}</span> the iguanas darted here and there catching them and eating them. Now there came into the forest an iguana trapper with spade and dogs to dig out iguanas; and the chameleon thought what a haul he would put in the trapper&rsquo;s way. So he went up to the man, and, lying down before him, asked why he was about in the forest. &ldquo;To catch iguanas,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Well, I know where there&rsquo;s a burrow of hundreds of them,&rdquo; said the chameleon, &ldquo;bring fire and brushwood and follow me.&rdquo; And he brought the trapper to where the iguanas dwelt. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the chameleon, &ldquo;put your fuel in there and smoke the iguanas out. Meantime let your dogs be all round and take a big stick in your hand. Then as the iguanas dash out, strike them down and make a pile of the slain.&rdquo; So saying, the treacherous chameleon withdrew to a spot nearby, where he lay down, with his head up, saying to himself, &ldquo;This day I shall see the rout of my enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The trapper set to work to smoke the iguanas out; and fear for their lives drove them helter-skelter from their burrow. As they came out, the trapper knocked them on the head, and if he missed them, they fell a prey to his dogs. And so there was great slaughter among the iguanas. Realising that this was the chameleon&rsquo;s doing, the Bodhisatta cried, &ldquo;One should never make friends with the wicked, for such bring sorrow in their train. A single wicked chameleon has proved the bane of all these iguanas.&rdquo; So saying, he escaped by the outlet he had provided, uttering this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Na pāpajanasaṁsevī accantaṁ sukham-edhati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Godhā kulaṁ kakaṇṭā va kaliṁ pāpeti attānan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Associating with the wicked doesn&rsquo;t bring endless happiness, like the chameleons who brought the iguana clan disaster. </span><span class="t18">{1.489}</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Devadatta was the chameleon of those days; this traitorous monk was the disobedient young iguana, the son of the Bodhisatta; and I myself the king of the iguanas.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Devadatta goes round trying to kill the Buddha, who tells a story of the past in which a hunter had tried to fool a jackal into thinking he was dead so he could catch him, but had failed therein, and was destined for hell.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the king of the jackals (sigālarājā),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;This is difficult to understand.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[1.304]</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta&rsquo;s going about to kill him. For, hearing the monks talking together as to this in the Dhamma Hall, the Teacher said that, as Devadatta acted now, so he acted in times gone by, yet failed &ndash; to his own grievous hurt &ndash; of his wicked purpose. And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a jackal, and dwelt in a charnel-grove with a great following of jackals of whom he was king. And at that time there was a festival held at Rājagaha, and a very wet festival it was, with everybody drinking hard. Now a parcel of rogues got hold of victual and drink in abundance, and putting on their best clothes sang and made merry over their fare. By midnight the meat was all gone, though the liquor still held out. Then on one asking for more meat and being told there was none left, said the fellow, &ldquo;Victuals never lack while I am about. I&rsquo;ll off to the charnel-grove, kill a jackal prowling about to eat the corpses, and bring back some meat.&rdquo; So saying he snatched up a club and made his way out of the city by the sewer to the place, where he lay down, club in hand, feigning to be dead. Just then, followed by the other jackals, the Bodhisatta came up and marked the pretended corpse. Suspecting the fraud, he determined to sift the matter. So he went round to the lee side and knew by the scent that the man was not really dead. Resolving to make the man look foolish before leaving him, the Bodhisatta stole near and took hold of the club with his teeth and tugged at it. The rascal did not leave go, not perceiving the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s approach, he <span class="t18">{1.490}</span> took a tighter grip. Hereon the Bodhisatta stepped back a pace or two and said: &ldquo;My good man, if you had been dead, you would not have tightened your grip on your club when I was tugging at it, and so have betrayed yourself.&rdquo; So saying, he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Etañ-hi te durājānaṁ, yaṁ sesi matasāyikaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yassa te kaḍḍhamānassa, hatthā daṇḍo na muccatī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">This is difficult to understand, you lie, lying as though dead, however, when tugging at you, your hands do not release the club.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Finding that he was discovered, the rogue sprang to his feet and flung his club at the Bodhisatta, but missed his aim, &ldquo;Be off, you brute,&rdquo; said <a id="a3003"></a><span class="t18">[1.305]</span> he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you this time.&rdquo; Turning round, the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;True you have missed me, but be assured you will not miss the torments of the Great Hell and the sixteen Lesser Hells.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Empty-handed, the rogue left the cemetery and, after bathing in a ditch, went back into the city by the way he had come.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Devadatta was the rogue of those times, and I the king of the jackals.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Devadatta makes himself out a Buddha, but loses all his disciples in a stroke. The Buddha tells a story of how a jackal wanted to emulate a lion and soon came to destruction.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the lion (sīha),</span></p>

For when Absorption left him and he lost the honour and profit which once were his, he in his perplexity asked the Teacher to concede the Five Points. This being refused, he made a schism in the Saṅgha and departed to Gayāsīsa with five hundred young monks, pupils of the Buddha&rsquo;s two chief disciples, but as yet unversed in the Dhamma and the Regulations. With this following he performed the acts of a separate Saṅgha gathered together within the same precincts. Knowing well the time when the knowledge of these young monks should ripen, the Teacher sent the two elders to them. Seeing these, </span><span class="t18">{1.491}</span><span class="t30"> Devadatta joyfully set to work expounding far into the night with (as he flattered himself) the masterly power of a Buddha. Then posing as a Buddha he said: &ldquo;The assembly, venerable Sāriputta, is still alert and sleepless. Will you be so good as to think of some Dhamma discourse to address to the monks? My back is aching with my labours, and I must rest it awhile.&rdquo; So saying he went away to lie down. Then those two chief disciples taught the monks, enlightening them as to the Fruitions and the Paths, till in the end they won them all over to go back to the Bamboo Grove.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3014"></a><span class="t30">Finding the monastery emptied of the monks, Kokālika went to Devadatta and told him how the two disciples had broken up his following and left the monastery empty, &ldquo;and yet here you still lie asleep,&rdquo; said he. So saying he stripped off Devadatta&rsquo;s outer cloth and kicked him on the chest with as little compunction as if he were knocking a roof-peg into a mud-wall. The blood gushed out of Devadatta&rsquo;s mouth, and ever after he suffered from the effects of the blow.</span><a id="a3015"></a><a href="notes.html#a14964"><span class="t9">{355}</span></a><a id="a3016"></a><span class="t18"> [1.306]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher said to Sāriputta, &ldquo;What was Devadatta doing when you got there?&rdquo; And Sāriputta answered that, though posing as a Buddha, evil had befallen him. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Even as now, Sāriputta, so in former times too has Devadatta imitated me to his own hurt.&rdquo; Then, at the elder&rsquo;s request, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a maned lion and dwelt at Gold Den in the Himālayas. Bounding forth one day from his lair, he looked north and west, south and east, and roared aloud as he went in quest of prey. Slaying a large buffalo, he devoured the prime of the carcass, after which he went down to a pool, and having drunk his fill of crystal water turned to go towards his den. Now a hungry jackal, suddenly meeting the lion, and being unable to make his escape, threw himself at the lion&rsquo;s feet. Being asked what he wanted, the jackal replied, &ldquo;Lord, let me be your servant.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the lion, &ldquo;serve me and you shall feed on prime meat.&rdquo; So saying, he went with the jackal following to Gold Den. Thenceforth the lion&rsquo;s leavings fell to the jackal, and he grew fat.</p>
<p class="p7">Lying one day in his den, the lion told the jackal to scan the valleys from the mountain top, to see whether there were any elephants or horses or buffaloes about, or any other animals <span class="t18">{1.492}</span> of which he, the jackal, was fond. If any such were in sight, the jackal was to report and say with due obeisance, &ldquo;Shine forth in your might, Lord.&rdquo; Then the lion promised to kill and eat, giving a part to the jackal. So the jackal used to climb the heights, and whenever he espied below beasts to his taste, he would report it to the lion, and falling at his feet, say, &ldquo;Shine forth in your might, Lord.&rdquo; Hereon the lion would nimbly bound forth and slay the beast, even if it were a rutting elephant, and share the prime of the carcass with the jackal. Glutted with his meal, the jackal would then retire to his den and sleep.</p>
<p class="p7">Now as time went on, the jackal grew bigger and bigger till be grew haughty. &ldquo;Have not I too four legs?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Why am I a pensioner day by day on others&rsquo; bounty? Henceforth I will kill elephants and other beasts, for my own eating. The lion, king of beasts, only kills them because of the formula, &lsquo;Shine forth in your might, Lord.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll make the lion call out to me, &lsquo;Shine forth in your might, jackal,&rsquo; and then I&rsquo;ll kill an elephant for myself.&rdquo; Accordingly he went to the lion, and pointing out that he had long lived on what the lion had killed, told his desire to eat an elephant of his own killing, ending with a request to the lion to let him, the jackal, couch in the lion&rsquo;s corner in Gold Den while the lion was to climb the mountain to look out for an elephant. The quarry found, he asked that the lion should come to him in the den and say, &lsquo;Shine forth in <a id="a3017"></a><span class="t18">[1.307]</span> your might, jackal.&rsquo; He begged the lion not to grudge him this much. Said the lion, &ldquo;Jackal, only lions can kill elephants, nor has the world ever seen a jackal able to cope with them. Give up this fancy, and continue to feed on what I kill.&rdquo; But say what the lion could, the jackal would not give way, and still pressed his request. So at last the lion gave way, and bidding the jackal couch in the den, climbed the peak and thence espied an elephant in rut. Returning to the mouth of the cave, he said: &ldquo;Shine forth in your might, jackal.&rdquo; Then from Gold Den the jackal <span class="t18">{1.493}</span> nimbly bounded forth, looked around him on all four sides, and, thrice raising its howl, sprang at the elephant, meaning to fasten on its head. But missing his aim, he alighted at the elephant&rsquo;s feet. The infuriated brute raised its right foot and crushed the jackal&rsquo;s head, trampling the bones into powder. Then pounding the carcass into a mass, and dunging upon it, the elephant dashed trumpeting into the forest. Seeing all this, the Bodhisatta observed, &ldquo;Now shine forth in your might, jackal,&rdquo; and uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Lasī ca te nipphalitā, matthako ca padālito,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sabbā te phāsukā bhaggā, ajja kho tvaṁ virocasī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Your brains are split open, and your head is smashed in, all your ribs are broken, today you did shine forth.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus spake the Bodhisatta, and living to a good old age he passed away in the fulness of time to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Devadatta was the jackal of those days, and I the lion.&rdquo;</span></p>

By focusing on the Meditation Object the Super Knowledges and Attainments were gained and a title won to the Brahmā Realm.&rdquo; So saying he told this story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{1.494}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a brahmin in the north country, and on the day of his birth his parents lit a birth-fire.</p>
<p class="p7">In his sixteenth year they addressed him thus, &ldquo;Son, on the day of your birth we lit a birth-fire for you. Now therefore choose. If you wish to lead a family life, learn the Three Vedas; but if you wish to attain to the Brahmā Realm, take your fire with you into the forest and there tend it, so as to win Mahābrahmā&rsquo;s favour and hereafter to enter into the Brahmā Realm.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Telling his parents that a family life had no charms for him, he went into the forest and dwelt in a hermitage tending his fire. An ox was given him as a fee one day in a border-village, and when he had driven it home to his hermitage, the thought came to him to sacrifice a cow to the Lord of Fire. But finding that he had no salt, and feeling that the Lord of Fire could not eat his meat-offering without it, he resolved to go back and bring a supply from the village for the purpose. So he tied up the ox and set off again to the village.</p>
<p class="p7">While he was gone, a band of hunters came up and, seeing the ox, killed it and cooked themselves a dinner. And what they did not eat they carried off, leaving only the tail and hide and the shanks. Finding only these sorry remains on his return, the brahmin exclaimed, &ldquo;As this Lord of Fire cannot so much as look after his own, how shall he look after me? It is a waste of time to serve him, bringing neither good nor profit.&rdquo; Having thus lost all desire to worship Fire, he said: &ldquo;My Lord of Fire, if you cannot manage to protect yourself, how shall you protect me? The meat being gone, you must make shift to fare on this offal.&rdquo; So saying, he threw on the fire the ox tail and the rest of the robbers&rsquo; leavings and uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Bahum-petaṁ asabbhi Jātaveda,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a3039"></a><span class="t33">&ldquo;You do not know, Rādha.&rdquo; </span><a id="a3040"></a><span class="t30">This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about hankering after the wife of one&rsquo;s mundane life. The incidents of the introductory story will be told in the Indriyajātaka [Ja 423].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3041"></a><span class="t34">The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning temptation by the wife of one&rsquo;s former days. The story is that a young man of good family at Sāvatthi heard the Teacher&rsquo;s preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymen&rsquo;s houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. He took what he had got to the wife he had left: she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3042"></a><span class="t34">The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. &ldquo;Salute him and bid him pass on.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, &ldquo;This is the father of my sons.&rdquo; She came out and saluted him: taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food: when he had eaten she saluted again and said: &ldquo;Sir, you are a saint now: we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householder&rsquo;s life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country: be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.&rdquo; For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: &ldquo;I cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life; send a layman&rsquo;s garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.&rdquo; She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Against his will they took him to the Teacher and told him that he was discontent and wished to go back to worldly life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher spoke thus to the monk, &ldquo;It is impossible to keep a guard over a woman; no guard can keep a woman in the right path. You yourself found in former days that all your safeguards were unavailing; and how can you now expect to have more success?&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a parrot. A certain brahmin in the Kāsi country was as a father to him and to his younger brother, treating them like his own children. Poṭṭhapāda was the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s name, and Rādha his brother&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the brahmin had a bold bad wife. And as he was leaving home on business, he said to the two brothers, &ldquo;If your mother, my wife, is minded to be naughty, stop her.&rdquo; &ldquo;We will, papa,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;if we can; <span class="t18">{1.496}</span> but if we can&rsquo;t, we will hold our peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3043"></a>Having thus entrusted his wife to the parrots&rsquo; charge, the brahmin set out on his business. Every day thenceforth his wife committed adultery; there was no end to the stream of her lovers in and out of the house. Moved by the sight, Rādha said to the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Brother, the parting injunction of our father was to stop any misconduct on his wife&rsquo;s part, and now she does nothing but misconduct herself. Let us stop her.&rdquo; <a id="a3044"></a><span class="t18">[1.310]</span> &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;your words are the words of folly. You might carry a woman about in your arms and yet she would not be safe. So do not essay the impossible.&rdquo; And so saying he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Na tvaṁ Rādha vijānāsi, aḍḍharatte anāgate,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Abyayataṁ vilapasi, virattā Kosiyāyane ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">You do not know, Rādha, later, halfway through the night who will come, you prattle foolishly, but Kosiyāyanī is indifferent.</span></p>
<p class="p23">And for the reasons thus given, the Bodhisatta did not allow his brother to speak to the brahmin&rsquo;s wife, who continued to gad about to her heart&rsquo;s content during her husband&rsquo;s absence. On his return, the brahmin asked Poṭṭhapāda about his wife&rsquo;s conduct, and the Bodhisatta faithfully related all that had taken place.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why, father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;should you have anything more to do with so wicked a woman?&rdquo; And he added these words, &ldquo;My father, now that I have reported my mother&rsquo;s wickedness, we can dwell here no longer.&rdquo; So saying, he bowed at the brahmin&rsquo;s feet and flew away with Rādha to the forest.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher taught the Four Truths, at the close whereof the monk who hankered after the wife of his mundane life was established in the fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;This husband and wife,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;were the brahmin and his wife of those days, Ānanda was Rādha, and I myself Poṭṭhapāda.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a3052"></a><span class="t15">In the present some people ordain late in life and persist in going to their families for alms, and lamenting the passing of their wives, but making no progress in the monastic life. The Buddha tells how, in the past, a pair of crows had got drunk on the remains of a sacrifice, and had lost his wife in the ocean, and how he and his friends had tried to empty the ocean with their beaks.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a3053"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the Sea Devatā (Samuddadevatā),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Our jaws are tired.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{1.497}</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a number of aged monks. While they were still of the world, they were rich and wealthy householders of Sāvatthi, all friends of one another; and tradition tells us that while they were engaged in good works they heard the Teacher preach. At once they cried, &ldquo;We are old; what to us are house and home? Let us join the Saṅgha, and following the Buddha&rsquo;s lovely dispensation make an end of sorrow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So they shared all their belongings amongst their children and families, and, leaving their tearful kindred, they came to ask the Teacher to receive them into the Saṅgha. But when admitted, they did not live the life of monks; </span><a id="a3055"></a><span class="t18">[1.311]</span><a id="a3056"></a><span class="t30"> and because of their age they failed to master the Dhamma.</span><a id="a3057"></a><a href="notes.html#a14968"><span class="t9">{357}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">As in their life as householders, so now too when they were monks they lived together, building themselves a cluster of neighbouring huts on the skirts of the monastery. Even when they went in quest of alms, they generally made for their wives&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s houses and ate there. In particular, all these old men were maintained by the bounty of the wife of one of their number, to whose house each brought what he had received and there ate it, with sauces and curries which she furnished.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">An illness having carried her off, the aged monks went their way back to the monastery, and falling on one another&rsquo;s necks walked about bewailing the death of their benefactress, the giver of sauces. The noise of their lamentation brought the monks to the spot to know what ailed them. And the aged men told how their kind benefactress was dead, and that they wept because they had lost her and should never see her like again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Shocked at such impropriety, the monks talked together in the Dhamma Hall about the cause of the old men&rsquo;s sorrow, and they told the Teacher too, on his entering the Hall and asking what they were discussing. &ldquo;Ah, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in times past, also, this same woman&rsquo;s death made them go about weeping and wailing; in those days she was a crow and was drowned in the sea, and these were toiling hard to empty all the water out of the sea in order to get her out, when the wise of those days saved them.&rdquo; And so saying he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3058"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a Sea Devatā. Now a crow with his mate came down in quest of food to the sea-shore <span class="t18">{1.498}</span> where, just before, certain persons had been offering to the Nāgas a sacrifice of milk, and rice, and fish, and meat and strong drink and the like. Up came the crow and with his mate ate freely of the elements of the sacrifice, and drank a great deal of the spirits. So they both got very drunk. Then they wanted to disport themselves in the sea, and were trying to swim on the surf, when a wave swept the hen-crow out to sea and a fish came and gobbled her up.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Oh, my poor wife is dead,&rdquo; cried the crow, bursting into tears and lamentations. Then a crowd of crows were drawn by his wailing to the spot to learn what ailed him. And when he told them how his wife had been carried out to sea, they all began with one voice to lament. Suddenly the thought struck them that they were stronger than the sea and that all they had to do was to empty it out and rescue their comrade! So they set to work with their bills to empty the sea out by mouthfuls, betaking themselves to dry land to rest so soon as their throats were sore with the salt water. And so they toiled away till their mouths and jaws were dry and inflamed and their eyes bloodshot, and they were ready to drop for weariness. Then in despair they turned to one another and said that it was in vain they laboured to empty the sea, <a id="a3059"></a><span class="t18">[1.312]</span> for no sooner had they got rid of the water in one place than more flowed in, and there was all their work to do over again; they would never succeed in baling the water out of the sea. And, so saying, they uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Api nu hanukā santā, mukhañ-ca parisussati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Oramāma, na pārema, pūrate va mahodadhī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Our jaws are tired, our mouths are dry, we must stop, not try to empty, the sea which is full to the brim.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Then all the crows fell to praising the beauty of her beak and eyes, her complexion, figure and sweet voice, saying that it was her excellencies that had provoked the sea to steal her from them. But <span class="t18">{1.499}</span> as they talked this nonsense, the Sea Devatā made a fearsome sight appear from the sea and so put them all to flight. In this wise they were saved.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The aged monk&rsquo;s wife was the female crow of those days, and her husband the male crow; the other aged monks were the rest of the crows, and I the Sea Devatā.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Being impaled in the air isn&rsquo;t suffering.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a monk who was overcome by passion. Being questioned by the Teacher, he admitted his frailty, explaining that he longed for the wife of his mundane life, &ldquo;For, oh sir!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she is so sweet a woman that I cannot live without her.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Monk,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;she is harmful to you. She it was that in former days was the means whereby you were impaled on a stake; and it was for bewailing her at your death that you were reborn in hell. Why then do you now long after her?&rdquo; And so saying, he told the following story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3068"></a><a id="a3069"></a><a id="a3070"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born an Air Devatā. Now in Benares there was held the night-festival of Kattikā; the city was decorated like a city of the gods, and the whole people kept holiday. And a poor man had only a couple of coarse cloths which he had washed and pressed till they were in a hundred, nay, a thousand creases. But his wife said: &ldquo;My husband, I want <a id="a3071"></a><span class="t18">[1.313]</span> a safflower-coloured cloth to wear outside and one to wear underneath, as I go about at the festival hanging round your neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;How are poor people like us to get safflowers?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Put on your nice clean attire and come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t have them dyed with safflower, I don&rsquo;t want to go at all,&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;Get some other woman to go to the festival with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Now why torment me like this? How are we to get safflowers?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Where there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s a way,&rdquo; retorted the woman. &ldquo;Are there no safflowers in the king&rsquo;s conservatories?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{1.500}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s conservatories are like a pool haunted by a Rakkhasa. There&rsquo;s no getting in there, with such a strong guard on the watch. Give over this fancy, and be content with what you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But when it&rsquo;s night-time and dark,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s to stop a man&rsquo;s going where he pleases?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">As she persisted in her entreaties, his love for her at last made him give way and promise she should have her wish. At the hazard of his own life, he sallied out of the city by night and got into the conservatories by breaking down the fence. The noise he made in breaking the fence roused the guard, who turned out to catch the thief. They soon caught him and with blows and curses put him in fetters. In the morning he was brought before the king, who promptly ordered him to be impaled alive. Off he was hauled, with his hands tied behind his back, and led out of the city to execution to the sound of the execution-drum, and was impaled alive. Intense were his agonies; and, to add to them, the crows settled on his head and pecked out his eyes with their dagger-like beaks. Yet, heedless of his pain, and thinking only of his wife, the man murmured to himself, &ldquo;Alas, I shall miss going to the festival with you arrayed in safflower-coloured cloths, with your arms twined round my neck.&rdquo; So saying, he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Na-y-idaṁ dukkhaṁ, aduṁ dukkhaṁ, yaṁ maṁ tudati vāyaso,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yaṁ Sāmā puppharattena Kattikaṁ nānubhossatī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Being impaled in the air isn&rsquo;t suffering, that is suffering: Sāmā with her safflowers will not enjoy the Kattika Fair.</span></p>
<p class="p23">And as he was babbling thus about his wife, he died and was reborn in hell.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;This husband and wife were the husband and wife of those days also, and I was the Air Devatā who made their story known.&rdquo;</span></p>
