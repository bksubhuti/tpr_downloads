<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the lady Visākhā receives eight boons from the Buddha, who then explains that in a previous life he had also given her a book. He then tells a story of how she had been a good and noble queen in a previous life, but without issue, till her virtue came to the notice of Sakka, King of the Devas, who granted her wish for a son. He also had a grand palace built for her, and sent a divine dancer to make her son laugh.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (the King of the Devas) Sakka,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Ānanda = (the god) Vissakamma,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Visākhā = queen Sumedhā (Sumedhādevī),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Bhaddaji = (prince) Mahāpanāda.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[4.198] </span><a id="a11325"></a><span class="t30">This story the Teacher told while dwelling nearby Sāvatthi in the mansion of Migāra&rsquo;s mother,</span><a id="a11326"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16302"><span class="t9">{985}</span></a><span class="t30"> how she, Visākhā the great lay sister, received Eight Boons. One day she had heard the Dhamma preached in Jetavana, and returned home after inviting the Buddha with his followers for the next day. But late in that night a mighty tempest deluged the four continents of the world. </span><span class="t18">{4.315}</span><a id="a11327"></a><a id="a11328"></a><span class="t30"> The Fortunate One addressed the monks as follows. &ldquo;As the rain falls in Jetavana, so, monks, falls the rain in the four continents of the world. Let yourselves be drenched to the skin: this is my last great world-storm!&rdquo; So with the monks, whose bodies were already drenched, by his Supernormal Powers he disappeared from Jetavana, and appeared in a room of Visākhā&rsquo;s mansion. She cried, &ldquo;A marvel indeed! A thing mysterious! O the miracle done by the power of the Tathāgata! With floods running knee deep, aye, with floods running waist-deep, not so much as the foot or the robe of a single monk will be wet!&rdquo; In joy and delight she waited upon the Buddha and all his company. After the meal was done, she said to the Buddha, &ldquo;Verily I crave boons at the hands of the Fortunate One.&rdquo; &ldquo;Visākhā, the Tathāgatas have boons beyond measure.&rdquo;</span><a id="a11329"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16304"><span class="t9">{986}</span></a><span class="t30"> &ldquo;But such as are permitted, such as are blameless?&rdquo; &ldquo;Speak on, Visākhā.&rdquo; &ldquo;I crave that all my life long I may have the right to give to the monks cloaks for the rainy season, food to all that come as guests, food to travelling monastics, food to the sick, food to those who wait on the sick, medicine to the sick, a continual distribution of rice gruel; and to the nuns all my life long robes for bathing in.&rdquo; The Teacher replied, &ldquo;What blessing have you in view, Visākhā, when you ask these eight boons of the Tathāgata?&rdquo; She told him the benefit she hoped for, and he said: &ldquo;It is well, it is well, Visākhā, it is well indeed, Visākhā, that this is the benefit you hope for in asking the eight boons of the Tathāgata.&rdquo; Then he said: &ldquo;I grant you the eight boons, Visākhā.&rdquo; Having granted her the eight boons and thanked her he departed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day when the Teacher was dwelling in the eastern park, they began to talk of it in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Monk, Visākhā the great lay sister, notwithstanding her womanhood, received eight boons at the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; hands. Ah, great are her virtues!&rdquo; The Teacher came in and asked what they spoke of. They told him. Said he, &ldquo;It is not now the first time this woman has received boons from me, for she received such before,&rdquo; and he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11330"></a>In the past, there reigned a king Suruci in Mithilā. This king, having a son born to him, gave him the name of Surucikumāra, or prince Splendid. When he grew up, he determined to study at Taxila; so there he went, and sat down in a hall at the city gate. <span class="t18">{4.316}</span> Now the <span class="t18">[4.199] </span>son of the king of Benares also, whose name was prince Brahmadatta, went to the same place, and took his seat on the same bench where prince Suruci sat. They entered into converse together, and became friends, and went both together to the teacher. They paid the fee, and studied, and before long their education was complete. Then they took leave of their teacher, and went on their road together. After travelling thus a short distance, they came to a stop at a place where the road parted. Then they embraced, and in order to keep their friendship alive they made a compact together, &ldquo;If I have a son and you a daughter, or if you have a son and I a daughter, we will make a match of it between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11331"></a><a id="a11332"></a>When they were on the throne, a son was born to king Suruci, and to him also the name of prince Suruci was given. Brahmadatta had a daughter, and her name was Sumedhā, the Wise lady. Prince Suruci in due time grew up, went to Taxila for his education, and when that was finished returned. Then his father, wishing to mark out his son for king by the ceremonial sprinkling, thought to himself, &ldquo;My friend the king of Benares has a daughter, so they say: I will make her my son&rsquo;s consort.&rdquo; For this purpose he sent an ambassador with rich gifts.</p>
<p class="p7">But before they had yet come, the king of Benares asked his queen this question, &ldquo;Lady, what is the worst misery for a woman?&rdquo; &ldquo;To quarrel with her fellow-wives.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, my lady, to save our only daughter the princess Sumedhā from this misery, we will give her to none but him that will have her and no other.&rdquo; So when the ambassadors came, and named the name of his daughter, he told them, &ldquo;Good friends, indeed it is true I promised my daughter to my old friend long ago. But we have no wish to cast her into the midst of a crowd of women, and we will give her only to one who will wed her and no other.&rdquo; This message they brought back to the king. But the king was displeased. &ldquo;Ours is a great kingdom,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the city of Mithilā covers seven leagues, the measure of the whole kingdom is three hundred leagues. Such a king should have sixteen thousand women at the least.&rdquo; But prince Suruci, hearing of the great beauty of Sumedhā, <span class="t18">{4.317}</span> fell in love from hearing of it only. So he sent word to his parents, saying: &ldquo;I will take her and no other: what do I want with a multitude of women? Let her be brought.&rdquo; They did not thwart his desire, but sent a rich present and a great ambassador to bring her home. Then she was made his queen consort, and they were both together consecrated by sprinkling.</p>
<p class="p7">He became king Suruci, and ruling in justice lived a life of high happiness with his queen. But although she dwelt in his palace for ten thousand years, never son nor daughter she had of him.</p>
<p class="p7">Then all the townsfolk gathered together in the palace courtyard, with upbraidings. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the king asked. &ldquo;Fault we have no other to find,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;but this, that you have no son to keep up your line.<span class="t18"> [4.200] </span>You have but one queen, yet a royal prince should have sixteen thousand at the least. Choose a company of women, my lord: some worthy wife will bring you a son.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear friends, what is this you say? I passed my word I would take no other but one, and on those terms I got her. I cannot lie, no host of women for me.&rdquo; So he refused their request, and they departed. But Sumedhā heard what was said. &ldquo;The king refuses to choose him concubines for his truth&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;well, I will find him someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Playing the part of mother and wife to the king, she chose at her own will a thousand maidens of the warrior caste, a thousand of the courtiers, a thousand daughters of householders, a thousand of all kinds of dancing girls, four thousand in all, and delivered them to him. And all these dwelt in the palace for ten thousand years, and never a son or daughter they brought between them. In this way she three times brought four thousand maidens but they had neither son nor daughter. Thus she brought him sixteen thousand wives in all.</p>
<p class="p7">Forty thousand years went by, that is to say, fifty thousand in all, counting the ten thousand he had lived with her alone. Then the townsfolk again gathered together with reproaches. &ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; the king asked. <span class="t18">{4.318}</span><a id="a11333"></a> &ldquo;My lord, command your women to pray for a son.&rdquo; The king was not unwilling, and commanded so to pray. Thenceforward praying for a son, they worshipped all manner of deities and offered all kinds of vows; yet no son appeared. Then the king commanded Sumedhā to pray for a son. She consented. On the fast of the fifteenth day of the month, she took upon her the eightfold Uposatha vows,<a id="a11334"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16306"><span class="t9">{987}</span></a> and sat meditating upon the virtues in a magnificent room upon a pleasant couch. The others were in the park, vowing to do sacrifice with goats or kine.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11335"></a><a id="a11336"></a>By the glory of Sumedhā&rsquo;s virtue Sakka&rsquo;s dwelling place began to tremble. Sakka pondered, and understood that Sumedhā prayed for a son; well, she should have one. &ldquo;But I cannot give her this or that son indifferently; I will search for one which shall be suitable.&rdquo; Then he saw a young Devaputta called Naḷākara, the Basket-weaver. He was a being endowed with merit, who in a former life lived in Benares, when this befell him. At seed-time as he was on his way to the fields he perceived a Paccekabuddha. He sent on his servants, bidding them sow the seed, but himself turned back, and led the Paccekabuddha home, and gave him to eat, and then conducted him again to the Ganges bank. He and his son together made a hut, trunks of fig trees for the foundation and reeds interwoven for the walls; a door he put to it, and made a path for walking. There for three months he made the Paccekabuddha dwell; and after the rains were over, the two of them, father and son, put on him the three robes and let him go. In the same manner they entertained seven Paccekabuddhas in that hut, and <span class="t18">[4.201] </span>gave them the three robes, and let them go their ways. So men still tell how these two, father and son, turned basket-weavers, and hunted for willows on the banks of the Ganges, and whenever they spied a Paccekabuddha did as we have said.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11337"></a>When they died, they were born in the heaven of the Thirty-Three, and dwelt in the six heavens of sense one after the other in direct and in reverse succession, enjoying great majesty among the gods. These two after dying in that region were desirous of winning to the upper Deva world. Sakka perceiving that one of them would be the Tathāgata, <span class="t18">{4.319}</span> went to the door of their mansion, and saluting him as he arose and came to meet him, said: &ldquo;Sir, you must go into the world of men.&rdquo; But he said: &ldquo;O king, the world of men is hateful and loathsome: they who dwell there do good and give alms longing for the world of the gods. What shall I do when I get there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, you shall enjoy in perfection all that can be enjoyed in that world; you shall dwell in a palace made with stones of price, five and twenty leagues in height. Do consent.&rdquo; He consented.</p>
<p class="p7">When Sakka had received his promise, in the guise of a sage he descended into the king&rsquo;s park, and showed himself soaring above those women to and fro in the air, while he chanted, &ldquo;To whom shall I give the blessing of a son, who craves the blessing of a son?&rdquo; &ldquo;To me, sir, to me!&rdquo; thousands of hands were uplifted. Then he said: &ldquo;I give sons to the virtuous: what is your virtue, what your life and conversation?&rdquo; They drew down their uplifted hands, saying: &ldquo;If you would reward virtue, go seek Sumedhā.&rdquo; He went his way through the air, and hovered at the window of her bedchamber. Then they went and told her, saying: &ldquo;See, my lady, a King of the Devas has come down through the air, and stands at your bedchamber window, offering you the boon of a son!&rdquo; With great pomp she proceeded there, and opening the window, said: &ldquo;Is this true, sir, that I hear, how you offer the blessing of a son to a virtuous woman?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is, and so I do.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then grant it to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is your virtue, tell me; and if you please me, I grant you the boon.&rdquo; Then declaring her virtue she recited these fifteen verses.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;I am king Ruci&rsquo;s consort-queen, the first he ever wed;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With Suruci ten thousand years my wedded life I led.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Suruci king of Mithilā, Videha&rsquo;s chief place,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I never lightly held his wish, nor deemed him mean or base,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In deed or thought or word, behind his back, nor to his face. </span><span class="t18">{4.320}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11338"></a><span class="t12">3. If this be true, O holy one, so may that son be given:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But if my lips are speaking lies, then burst my head in seven.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. The parents of my husband dear, so long as they held sway,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And while they lived, would ever give me training in the way.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. My passion was to hurt no life, and willingly do right:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I served them with extremest care unwearied day and night.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11339"></a><span class="t12">6. If this be true, O holy one, so may that son be given:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But if my lips are speaking lies, then burst my head in seven. </span><span class="t18">[4.202]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. No less than sixteen thousand dames my fellow-wives have been:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet, brahmin, never jealousy nor anger came between.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. At their good fortune I rejoice; each one of them is dear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My heart is soft to all these wives as though myself it were.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. If this be true, O holy one, so may that son be given:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But if my lips are speaking lies, then burst my head in seven.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Slaves, messengers, and servants all, and all about the place,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I give them food, I treat them well, with cheerful pleasant face.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. If this be true, O holy one, so may that son be given:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But if my lips are speaking lies, then burst my head in seven.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. Ascetics, brahmins, any man who begging here is seen,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I comfort all with food and drink, my hands all washen clean.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. If this be true, O holy one, so may that son be given:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But if my lips are speaking lies, then burst my head in seven.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. The eighth of either fortnight, the fourteenth, fifteenth days,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11340"></a><span class="t12">And the especial fast I keep, I walk in holy ways.</span><a id="a11341"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16308"><span class="t19">{988}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. If this be true, O holy one, so may that son be given:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But if my lips are speaking lies, then burst my head in seven.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.321}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Indeed not a hundred verses, nor a thousand, could suffice to sing the praise of her virtues: yet Sakka allowed her to sing her own praises in these fifteen verses, nor did he cut the tale short though he had much to do elsewhere; then he said: &ldquo;Abundant and marvellous are your virtues,&rdquo; then in her praise he recited a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;All these great virtues, glorious dame, O daughter of a king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Are found in you, which of thyself, O lady, you do sing.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. A warrior, born of noble blood, all glorious and wise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Videha&rsquo;s righteous emperor, your son, shall soon arise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When these words she heard, in great joy she recited two verses, putting a question to him: <span class="t18">{4.322}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. &ldquo;Unkempt, with dust and dirt begrimed, high-poiséd in the sky,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You speakest in a lovely voice that pricks me to the heart.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. Are you a mighty god, O sage and dwell in heaven on high?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O tell me whence you comest here, O tell me who you are!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">He told her in six verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. &ldquo;Sakka the hundred-eyed you see, for so the gods me call</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When they are wont to assemble in the heavenly judgement hall.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. When women virtuous, wise, and good here in the world are found,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11342"></a><span class="t12">True wives, to husband&rsquo;s mother kind even as in duty bound,</span><a id="a11343"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16310"><span class="t19">{989}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. When such a woman wise of heart and good in deed they know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To her, though woman, they divine, the gods themselves will go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. So lady, you, through worthy life, through store of good deeds done,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A princess born, all happiness the heart can wish, have won. </span><span class="t18">[4.203]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. So you do reap your deeds, princess, by glory on the earth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And after in the world of gods a new and heavenly birth.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. O wise, O blessed! So live on, preserve your conduct right:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now I to heaven must return, delighted with your sight. </span><span class="t18">{4.323}</span></p>
<p class="p6">I have business to do in the world of gods,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;therefore I go; but do you be vigilant.&rdquo; With this advice he departed.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11344"></a>In the morning time, the Devaputta Naḷakāra was conceived within her womb. When she discovered it, she told the king, and he did what was necessary for a woman with child.<a id="a11345"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16312"><span class="t9">{990}</span></a> At the end of ten months she brought forth a son, and they gave him Mahāpanāda for his name. All the people of the two countries came crying out, &ldquo;My lord, we bring this for the boy&rsquo;s milk-money,&rdquo; and each dropped a coin in the king&rsquo;s courtyard: a great heap there was of them. The king did not wish to accept this, but they would not take the money back, but said as they departed, &ldquo;When the boy grows up, my lord, it will pay for his keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11346"></a>The lad was brought up amid great magnificence; and when he came of years, aye, no more than sixteen, he was perfect in all accomplishments. The king thinking of his son&rsquo;s age, said to the queen, &ldquo;My lady, when the time comes for the ceremonial sprinkling of our son, let us make him a fine palace for that occasion.&rdquo; She was quite willing. The king sent for those who had skill in divining the auspicious place for a building,<a id="a11347"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16315"><span class="t9">{991}</span></a><a id="a11348"></a> and said to them, &ldquo;My friends, get a master-mason,<a id="a11349"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16317"><span class="t9">{992}</span></a><a id="a11350"></a> and build me a palace not far from my own. This is for my son, whom we are about to consecrate as my successor.&rdquo; They said it was well, and proceeded to examine the surface of the ground. At that moment Sakka&rsquo;s throne became hot. Perceiving this, he at once summoned Vissakamma,<a id="a11351"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16320"><span class="t9">{993}</span></a> and said: &ldquo;Go, my good Vissakamma, make for prince Mahāpanāda a palace half a league in length and breadth and five and twenty leagues in height, all with stones of price.&rdquo; Vissakamma took on the shape of a mason, and approaching the workmen said: &ldquo;Go and eat your breakfast, then return.&rdquo; Having thus got rid of the men, he struck on the earth with his staff; in that instant up rose a palace, seven storeys high, of the aforesaid size.</p>
<p class="p7">Now for Mahāpanāda these three ceremonies were done together: the ceremony for consecrating the palace, the ceremony for spreading above him the royal umbrella, the ceremony of his marriage. At the time of the ceremony all the people of both countries gathered together, and spent seven years feasting, nor did the king dismiss them: their clothes, their ornaments, their food and their drink <span class="t18">{4.324}</span> and all the rest of it, these things were <span class="t18">[4.204] </span>all provided by the royal family. At the seven years&rsquo; end they began to grumble, and king Suruci asked why. &ldquo;O king,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;while we have been revelling at this feast seven years have gone by. When will the feast come to an end?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;My good friends, all this while my son has never once laughed. So soon as he shall laugh, we will disperse again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the crowd went beating the drum and gathered the tumblers and jugglers together. Thousands of tumblers were gathered, and they divided themselves into seven bands and danced; but they could not make the prince laugh. Of course he that had seen the dancing of dancers divine could not care for such dancers as these.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11352"></a>Then came two clever jugglers, Bhaṇḍukaṇṇa and Paṇḍukaṇṇa [Crop-ear and Yellow-ear], and they said: &ldquo;We will make the prince laugh.&rdquo; Bhaṇḍukaṇṇa made a great mango tree, which he called Sanspareil, grow before the palace door: then he threw up a ball of string, and made it catch on a branch of the tree, and then up he climbed into the Mango Sanspareil. Now the Mango Sanspareil they say is Vessavaṇa&rsquo;s mango.<a id="a11353"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16322"><span class="t9">{994}</span></a><a id="a11354"></a><a id="a11355"></a> And the slaves of Vessavaṇa took him, as usual, chopped him up by the various limbs and threw down the bits. The other jugglers joined the pieces together, and poured water upon them. The man donned upper and under garments of flowers, and rose up and began dancing again. Even the sight of this did not make the prince laugh. Then Paṇḍukaṇṇa had some firewood piled in the courtyard and went into the fire with his troop. When the fire was burnt out, the people sprinkled the pile with water. Paṇḍukaṇṇa with his troop rose up dancing with upper and under<a id="a11356"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16324"><span class="t9">{995}</span></a> garments of flowers.</p>
<p class="p7">When the people found they could not make him laugh, they grew angry. Sakka, perceiving this, sent down a divine dancer, bidding him make prince Mahāpanāda laugh. Then he came and remained poised in the air above the royal courtyard, <span class="t18">{4.325}</span> and performed what is called the Half-body dance: one hand, one foot, one eye, one tooth, go dancing, throbbing, flickering to and fro, all the rest stood still. Mahāpanāda, when he saw this, gave a little smile. But the crowd roared and roared with laughter, could not cease laughing, laughed themselves out of their wits, lost control of their limbs, rolled over and over in the royal courtyard, and that was the end of the festival. The rest of it must be explained as in the Mahāpanādajātaka [Ja 264]:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: &ldquo;Thus, monks, Visākhā has received a boon of me before,&rdquo; and then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time, Bhaddaji was Mahāpanāda, Visākhā the lady Sumedhā, Ānanda was Vissakamma, and I myself was Sakka.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present on the fast day the lay folk take up the eight Uposatha precepts. The Buddha tells a story of various animals who understanding their defilements had led them to suffering had decided to keep the vows; and of their teacher who did the same to tame his pride.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;You are content.&rdquo;</span><a id="a11368"></a><a id="a11369"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about five hundred lay brethren who were under the Uposatha precepts. At that time they say that the Teacher, seated upon the Buddha&rsquo;s glorious seat, in the Dhamma Hall, in the midst of folk of all the four kinds,</span><a id="a11370"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16330"><span class="t9">{998}</span></a><a id="a11371"></a><span class="t30"> looking around upon the gathering with a gentle heart, perceived that this day the teaching would turn on the tale of the lay brethren.</span><a id="a11372"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16332"><span class="t9">{999}</span></a><span class="t30"> Then he addressed these, and said: &ldquo;Have the lay brethren taken upon them the Uposatha precepts?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir, they have,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;It was well done, this Uposatha celebration was the practice of wise men of old: the wise men of old, I say, kept the Uposatha celebration in order to subdue the defilements of passion and lust.&rdquo; Then at their request he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past there was a great forest which separated the kingdom of Magadha from the two kingdoms that lay alongside it. The Bodhisatta was born in Magadha, as one of a great brahmin family. When he grew up, he renounced his desires, and departed, and went into that forest, where he made a hermitage and dwelt there. Now not very far from this hermitage, in a clump made of bamboos, <span class="t18">{4.326}</span> lived a wood-pigeon with his mate; in a certain ant-hill lived a snake; in one thicket a jackal had his lair, in another a bear. These four creatures used to visit the sage from time to time, and listened to his discourses.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11373"></a>One day the pigeon and his mate left their nest and went foraging for food. The hen went behind, and as she went, a hawk pounced on her <span class="t18">[4.206] </span>and carried her off. Hearing her outcry the chicken turned and looked, and beheld him bearing her away! The hawk killed her in the midst of her cries, and devoured her. Now the chicken-bird burned with the fire of love for his mate thus torn from him. Then he thought: &ldquo;This passion torments me exceedingly; I will not go seek my food until I have found how to subdue it.&rdquo; So cutting short his quest, away he went to the ascetic, and taking upon him the vow for the subduing of desire, he lay down on one side.</p>
<p class="p7">The snake also thought he would seek for food; so out of his hole came he, and sought something to eat on a cow-track near one of the frontier villages. Just then there was a bull belonging to the village headman, a glorious creature white all over, which after feeding went down on his knees at the foot of a certain ant-hill, and tossed the earth with his horns in sport. The snake was terrified at the noise of the bull&rsquo;s hooves, and darted forward to hide in the ant-hill. The bull happened to tread on him, whereupon the snake was angry and bit the bull; and the bull died then and there. When the villagers found out that the bull was dead, they all ran together weeping, and honoured the dead with garlands, and buried him in a grave, and returned to their homes. The snake came forth when they had departed, and thought: &ldquo;Through anger I have deprived this creature of life, and I have caused sorrow to the hearts of many. Never again will I go out to get food until I have learned to subdue it.&rdquo; Then he turned and went to the hermitage, and taking upon him the vow for the subduing of anger, lay down on one side.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11374"></a>The jackal likewise went to seek food, and found a dead elephant.<a id="a11375"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16334"><span class="t9">{1000}</span></a> He was delighted, &ldquo;Plenty of food here!&rdquo; cried he, and went and took a bite of the trunk &ndash; it was as though he bit on a tree-trunk. He got no pleasure of that, and bit by the tusk &ndash; he might have been biting a stone. He tried the belly &ndash; it might have been a basket. So he fell on to the tail, <span class="t18">{4.327}</span> it was like an iron bowl. Then he attacked the rump, and lo! it was soft as a cake of ghee. He liked it so well that he ate his way inside. There he remained, eating when he was hungry, and when he was thirsty drinking the blood; and when he lay down, spreading the beast&rsquo;s inwards and lungs as a bed to lie on. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;I have found me both food and drink, and my bed; what is the use of going elsewhere?&rdquo; So there he stayed, well content, in the elephant&rsquo;s belly, and never came out at all.</p>
<p class="p7">But by and by the corpse grew dry in the wind and the heat, and the way out by the rear was closed. The jackal, tormented within, lost flesh and blood, his body turned yellow, but how to get out he could not see. Then one day came an unexpected storm; the body was drenched and grew soft, and began to gape open. When he saw the opening, the jackal cried, &ldquo;Too long have I been here in torment, and now I will out <span class="t18">[4.207] </span>by this hole.&rdquo; Then he went at the place head first. Now the passage was narrow, and he went fast, so his body was bruised and he left all his hair behind him. When he got out he was bare as a palm-trunk, not a hair to be seen on him. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;it is my greed has brought all this trouble upon me. Never again will I go out to feed, until I have learned how to subdue my greed.&rdquo; Then he went to the hermitage, and took on him the vow for subduing of greed, and lay down on one side.</p>
<p class="p7">The bear too came out of the forest, and being a slave to greediness, went to a frontier village of the kingdom of Mala. &ldquo;Here is a bear!&rdquo; cried the villagers all; and out they came armed with bows, sticks, staves, and what not, and surrounded the thicket wherein he lay. Finding himself encompassed with a crowd he rushed out and made away, and as he went they belaboured him with their bows and cudgels. He came home with a broken head and running with blood. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;it is my exceeding greed which has brought all this trouble upon me. Never again will I go out for food until I have learned how to subdue it.&rdquo; So he went to the hermitage, and took on him the vow for subduing of greediness, and lay down on one side. <span class="t18">{4.328}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11376"></a>But the ascetic was unable to induce the Absorption, because he was full of pride for his noble birth. A Paccekabuddha, perceiving that he was possessed with pride, yet recognised that he was no common creature. &ldquo;The man (thought he) is destined to be a Buddha, and in this very cycle he will attain to perfect wisdom. I will help him to subdue his pride, and I will cause him to develop the Attainments.&rdquo; So as he sat in his hut of leaves, the Paccekabuddha came down from the Higher Himālayas, and seated himself on the ascetic&rsquo;s slab of stone. The ascetic came out and saw him upon his own seat, and in his pride was no longer master of himself. He went up and snapped fingers at him, crying out, &ldquo;Curse you, vile good-for-naught, bald-pate deceitful person, why are you sitting on my seat?&rdquo; &ldquo;Holy man,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;why are you possessed with pride? I have penetrated the wisdom of a Paccekabuddha, and I tell you that during this very cycle you shall become omniscient; you are destined to become a Buddha! When you have fulfilled the Perfections,<a id="a11377"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16336"><span class="t9">{1001}</span></a> after the lapse of another such period of time, a Buddha you shall be; and when you have become a Buddha, Siddhattha will be your name.&rdquo; Then he told him of name and clan and family, chief disciples, and so forth, adding, &ldquo;Now why are you so proud and passionate? The thing is unworthy of you.&rdquo; Such was the advice of the Paccekabuddha.</p>
<p class="p7">To these words the other said nothing: no salutation even, no question as to when or where or how he should become a Buddha. Then the visitor <span class="t18">[4.208] </span><a id="a11378"></a>said: &ldquo;Learn the measure of your birth and my powers<a id="a11379"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16338"><span class="t9">{1002}</span></a> by this: if you can, rise up in the air as I do.&rdquo; So saying, he arose in the air, and shook off the dust of his feet upon the coil of hair which the other wore on his head, and then returned back to the Higher Himālayas. At his departure the ascetic was overcome with grief. &ldquo;There is a holy man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with a heavy body like that, passes through the air like a cotton-fleck blown by the wind! Such a one, a Paccekabuddha, and I never kissed his feet, because of my pride of birth, never asked him when I should become Buddha. What can this birth do for me? In this world the thing of power is a good life; <span class="t18">{4.329}</span> but this pride of mine will bring me to hell. Never again will I go out to seek for wild fruits until I have learned how to subdue my pride.&rdquo; Then he entered his leaf-hut, and took upon him the vow for subduing pride. Seated upon his pallet of twigs, the wise young noble subdued his pride, focused on the Meditation Object, developed the Super Knowledges and Attainments, then came forth and sat down on the stone seat which was at the end of the covered walk.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the pigeon and the others came up, saluted him and sat on one side. The Great Being said to the pigeon, &ldquo;On other days you never come here at this time, but you go seeking food: are you keeping a sabbath fast today?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir, I am.&rdquo; Then he said: &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; reciting the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;You are content with little, I am sure.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do want no food, O flying pigeon, now?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hunger and thirst why willingly endure?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why take upon you, sir, the Uposatha vow?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To which the pigeon made answer in two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Once full of greediness my mate and I</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sported like lovers both about this spot.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Her a hawk pounced on, and away did fly:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So, torn from me, she whom I loved was not!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. In various ways my cruel loss I know;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I feel a pang in everything I see;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So to Uposatha precepts for help I go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That passion never may come back to me.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.330}</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the pigeon had thus praised his own action with regard to the vows, the Great Being put the same question to the snake and all the rest one by one. They declared each one the thing as it was.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Tree-dweller, coiling, belly-crawling snake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Armed with strong fangs and poison quick and sure,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Uposatha precepts why do you wish to take?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why thirst and hunger willingly endure?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;The headman&rsquo;s bull, all full of strength and might,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With hump all quivering, beautiful and fair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He trod on me &ndash; in anger I did bite:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pierced with the pain he perished then and there. </span><span class="t18">[4.209]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Out pour the village people every one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Weeping and wailing for the sight they see.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Therefore to sabbath vow for help I run,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That passion never more come back to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Carrion to you is food both rich and rare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Corpses on charnel ground that rotting lie.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why does a jackal thirst and hunger bear?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why take Uposatha precepts upon him, why?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;I found an elephant, and liked the meat</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So well, within his belly I did stay.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But the hot wind and the sun&rsquo;s parching heat</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dried up the passage where I pushed my way.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. All thin and yellow I became, my lord!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There was no path to go by, I must stay.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then came a storm that vehemently poured,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Damping and softening that postern way.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Then to get out again not slow was I,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11380"></a><span class="t12">Like the Moon issuing from Rāhu&rsquo;s jaws:</span><a id="a11381"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16340"><span class="t19">{1003}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{4.331}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So to Uposatha precepts for help I fly</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That greed may keep far from me: there&rsquo;s the cause.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;It was your manner once to make a meal</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of ants upon the ant-heap, teacher bear:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why willing now hunger and thirst to feel?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why willing now Uposatha precepts to swear?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;From greed exceeding scorned I my own home,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To Malatā I made all haste to flee.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Out from the village all the folk did come,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With bows and bludgeons they belaboured me.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. With blood besmeared and with a broken head</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Back to my dwelling I made haste to flee.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So to Uposatha precepts I now have fled</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That greed may never more come nigh to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did they all four praise their own deed in taking of these vows upon them; then rising up and saluting the Great Being, they asked him this question, &ldquo;Sir, on other days you go out at this time to seek for wild fruits. Why is it today you go not, but observe the Uposatha precepts?&rdquo; They recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;That thing, sir, which you have a mind to learn</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To our best knowledge we have told it now:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But we would ask a question in our turn:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why you, O brahmin, take the Uposatha vow?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.332}</span></p>
<p class="p6">He explained it to them:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo; &rsquo;Twas a Paccekabuddha, who but came</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And stayed a moment in my hut, and showed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My comings and my goings, name and fame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My family, and all my future road.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. Then eaten up by pride, I did not throw</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Myself before his feet; I asked no more.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So to Uposatha precepts for help I go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That pride may not come nigh me as of yore.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.210]</span></p>
<p class="p6">In this manner the Great Being explained his own keeping of these vows. Then he admonished them, and sent them away, and went into his hut. The others returned each to his own place. The Great Being without interrupting his Absorption became destined for the Brahmā Realm, and the others abiding by his admonition, went to swell the hosts of heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended this discourse, said: &ldquo;Thus, lay brethren, the Uposatha precepts were the custom of wise men of old, and must be kept now.&rdquo; Then he identified the Jātaka. &ldquo;At that time Anurudha was the pigeon, Kassapa was the bear, Moggallāna the jackal, Sāriputta the snake, and I myself was the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a11389"></a><span class="t15">In the present one monk is discontent with the monastic life. The Buddha tells a story of a golden peacock who was protected by his virtue for 7,000 years until a peahen caught him off his guard, sparked his lust, and he was caught by her handler. After converting his hunter, he and all other animals in the kingdom were set free.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the king of the peacocks (morarājā).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;If I being captured.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about a discontented monk. To this monk the Teacher said, </span><span class="t18">{4.333}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Is it true, as I am told, that you are discontent?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir, it is true.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monk,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will not this lust for pleasure confound a man like you? The hurricane that overwhelms Mount Sineru is not put to the blush before a withered leaf. In days of yore this passion has confounded holy beings, who for seven thousand years held aloof from following the sensual desires that arise within.&rdquo; With these words, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11391"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was conceived by a peahen in a border country. When the due time had passed, the mother laid her egg in the place where she was feeding, and went away. Now the egg of a mother which is healthy comes to no harm, if there be no danger from snakes or such-like vermin. This egg therefore being of a golden colour like to a kaṇikāra<a id="a11392"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16344"><span class="t9">{1005}</span></a> bud, when it was ripe, cracked of its own force, and issued forth a peachick of the colour of gold, with two eyes like gunja fruit, and a coral beak, and three red streaks ran round his throat and down the middle of his back. When he grew up his body was big as a tradesman&rsquo;s barrow, very fine to behold, and all the dark peafowl gathered together and chose him to be their king.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, as he was drinking water out of a pool, he espied his own beauty, and thought: &ldquo;I am fairest of all peacocks. If I remain with <span class="t18">[4.211] </span>them among the paths of men, I shall fall into some danger: I will go away to the Himālayas, and there dwell alone in a pleasant place.&rdquo; So in the night time, when all the peafowl were in their secret retreats, unknown to any he departed to the Himālayas, and traversing three ranges of mountains settled in the fourth. This was in a forest where he found a vast natural lake all covered with lotus, and not far away a huge banyan tree nearby a hill; in the branches of this tree he alighted.</p>
<p class="p7">In the heart of this hill was a delightful cave; and being desirous to dwell there, he alighted on a flatland just at the mouth of it. Now to this place it was impossible to climb, whether up from below or down from above; <span class="t18">{4.334}</span> free it was from all fear of birds, wildcats, serpents, or men. &ldquo;Here is a delightful place for me!&rdquo; he thought. That day he remained there, and on the next coming forth from the cave he sat on the hill-top facing the east. When he saw the sun&rsquo;s globe arise, he protected himself for the coming day by reciting the verse:<a id="a11393"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16346"><span class="t9">{1006}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11394"></a><span class="t12">&ldquo;There he rises, king all-seeing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Making all things bright with his golden light.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">You I worship, glorious being,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Making all things bright with your golden light,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Keep me safe, I pray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Through the coming day.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">All saints, the righteous, wise in holy lore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">These do I honour, and their aid implore:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">All honour to the wise, to wisdom honour be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">To freedom, and to all that freedom has made free.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After this he went out seeking for food. In the evening he returned again, and sat on the top of the hill facing the west; then, when he saw the sun&rsquo;s globe sinking out of sight, he protected himself against the coming night by reciting the verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ldquo;There he sets, the king all-seeing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">He that makes all bright with his golden light.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">You I worship, glorious being,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Making all things bright with your golden light.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Through the night, as through the day,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Keep me safe, I pray.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">All saints, the righteous, wise in holy lore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">These do I honour and their aid implore:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">All honour to the wise, to wisdom honour be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">To freedom, and to all that freedom has made free.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">In this manner his life passed by.</p>
<p class="p7">But one day a hunter who lived in the forest caught sight of him as he sat on the hill-top, and went home again. When his time came to die, he told his son of it, &ldquo;My son, in the fourth range of the mountains, in the forest, lives a golden peacock. If the king wants one you know where to find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">One day the chief queen of the king of Benares (her name was Khemā) saw a vision in the dawning, and the vision was after this fashion: a golden peacock was preaching the Dhamma, she was listening with approval, the peacock having finished his discourse arose to depart, she cried out upon it, &ldquo;The king of the peacocks is escaping, catch him!&rdquo; And as she was uttering these words, she awoke. When she awoke, and perceived that it was a dream, she thought: &ldquo;If I tell the king it was a dream, he will take no notice of it; but if I say it is the longing of a woman with child, then he will take notice.&rdquo; So she made as though she had a craving as they who are with child, and lay down. The king visited her and asked what was her ailment. &ldquo;I have a craving,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What is it you desire?&rdquo; &ldquo;I wish, my lord, to hear the discourse of a golden-hued peacock.&rdquo; &ldquo;But where can we get such a peacock, lady?&rdquo; &ldquo;If one cannot be found, my lord, I shall die.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not trouble about it, my lady; if there exist such a one anywhere, it shall <span class="t18">[4.212] </span>be got for you.&rdquo; Thus he consoled her, and then went away and sitting down asked his courtiers the question, &ldquo;Look you, my queen desires to hear the discourse of a golden peacock. <span class="t18">{4.335}</span> Are there such things as golden peacocks?&rdquo; &ldquo;The brahmins will know that, my lord.&rdquo; The king enquired of the brahmins. Thus the brahmins made answer, &ldquo;O great king! It is said in our verses of lucky marks: &lsquo;Of water-beasts fish, turtles, and crabs, of land-beasts deer, wild-geese, peacocks, and partridges, these creatures and men too can be of a golden colour.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king gathered together all the hunters that were in his domains, and asked them, had they ever before seen a golden peacock. They all answered, no, except the one whose father had told him what he had seen. This one said: &ldquo;I have never seen one myself, but my father told me of a place where a golden peacock is to be found.&rdquo; Then the king said: &ldquo;My good man, this means life and death to me and my queen: catch him and bring him here.&rdquo; He gave the man plenty of money and sent him off.</p>
<p class="p7">The man gave the money to his wife and son, and went to the place, and saw the Great Being. He set a snare for him, each day telling himself the creature would certainly be caught; yet he died without catching him. And the queen too died without having her heart&rsquo;s desire. The king was very angry and wroth, for he said: &ldquo;My beloved queen has died on account of this peacock,&rdquo; and he caused the story to be written upon a golden plate, how that in the fourth range of the Himālayas lives a golden peacock, and they who eat his flesh will be ever young and immortal. This plate he placed in his treasury, and afterwards died. After him another king rose up, who read what was written upon the plate, and being desirous to be immortal and ever young, sent a hunter to catch him; but he died first like the other.</p>
<p class="p7">In this manner six kings succeeded and passed away, six hunters died unsuccessful in the Himālayas. But the seventh hunter, sent by the seventh king, being unable to catch the bird through seven years, although each day he expected to do it, began to wonder, why there was no catching this peacock&rsquo;s feet in a snare. So he watched the bird, and saw him at his prayers for protection morning and evening, and thus he argued the case, &ldquo;There is no other peacock in the place, and it is clear this must be a bird of holy life. <span class="t18">{4.336}</span> It is the power of his holiness, and of the protecting charm, which makes his feet never to catch in my snare.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Having come to this conclusion, he went to the borderland and caught a peahen, which he trained at finger-snap to utter her note, at clap of hand to dance. Taking her with him, he returned; then setting his snare before the Bodhisatta had recited his charm, he snapped his fingers, and made her utter a cry. The peacock heard it: on the instant, the wrong which for seven thousand years had lain quiescent, reared itself up like a cobra spreading his hood at a blow. Being sick with lust, he could not recite his protecting charm, but making all haste towards her, he came <span class="t18">[4.213] </span>down from the air with his feet right in the snare: that snare which for seven thousand years had no power to catch him, now caught his foot fast.</p>
<p class="p7">When the hunter spied him dangling at the end of the stick, he thought to himself, &ldquo;Six hunters failed to catch this king of the peacocks, and for seven years I could not. But today, so soon as he became lust-sick for this peahen, he was unable to repeat his charm, came to the snare and was caught, and there he dangles head downwards. So virtuous is the being which I have hurt! To hand over such a creature to another for the sake of a bribe is an unseemly thing. What are the king&rsquo;s honours to me? I will let him go.&rdquo; But again he thought: &ldquo;It is a monstrous mighty and strong bird, and if I go up to him he may think I have come to kill him, he will be in fear of his life, and in struggling he may break a leg or a wing. I will not go near him, but I will stand in hiding and cut the snare with an arrow. Then he can go his ways at his own will.&rdquo; So he stood hidden, and stringing his bow fitted an arrow to the string and drew it back.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the peacock was thinking: &ldquo;This hunter has made me sick with lust, and when he sees me caught he will not be careless of me. Where can he be?&rdquo; He looked this way, and he looked that way, and spied the man standing with bow ready to shoot. <span class="t18">{4.337}</span> &ldquo;No doubt he wants to kill me and go,&rdquo; he thought, and in fear of death repeated the first verse asking for his life:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;If I being captured wealth to you shall bring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then wound me not, but take me still alive.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I pray you, friend, conduct me to the king:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I think a most rich reward he will give.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hereupon the hunter thought: &ldquo;The great peacock imagines I am going to shoot him with this arrow: I must relieve his mind,&rdquo; to which end he recited the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;I have not set this arrow to the bow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To do you hurt, O peacock king, today:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I wish to cut the snare and let you go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then follow your own will, and fly away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this the peacock replied in two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Seven years, O hunter, first you did pursue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Enduring thirst and hunger night and day:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now I am in the snare, what would you do?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why wish to loose me, let me fly away?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Surely all living things are safe for thee:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Taking of life you have forsworn this day:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For I am in the snare, yet you would free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet you would loose me, let me fly away.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.338}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then this follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;When a man swears to hurt no living thing:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When all that live, for him, from fear are free:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What blessing in the next birth will this bring?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O royal peacock, answer this for me! </span><span class="t18">[4.214]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. When all that live, for him, from fear are free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When the man swears to hurt no living thing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Even in the present world, well praised is he,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Him after death to heaven his worth will bring.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. There are no gods, so many men do say:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The highest bliss this life alone can bring;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This yields the fruit of good or evil way;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And giving is declared a foolish thing.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So I snare birds, for holy men have said it:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do not their words, I ask, deserve my credit?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being determined to tell the man the reality of another world; and as he swung at the end of the rod head-downwards, he repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;All clear to vision sun and moon both go</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">High in the sky along their shining way.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What do men call them in the world below?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Are they of this world or another, say!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.339}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The hunter repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;All clear to vision sun and moon both go</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">High in the sky along their shining way.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They are no part of this our world below,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But of another: that is what men say.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being said to him:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Then they are wrong, they lie who such things say;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Without all cause, who say this world can bring</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Alone the fruit of good or evil way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or who declare giving a foolish thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">As the Great Being spoke, the hunter pondered, and then repeated a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;Verily this is true which you do say:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How can one say that gifts no fruit can bring?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That here one reaps the fruit of evil way</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or good; that giving is a foolish thing?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. How shall I act, what do, what holy way</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Am I to follow, peacock king, O tell!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What manner of ascetic virtue &ndash; say,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That I be saved from sinking into hell!&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.340}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being thought, when he heard this, &ldquo;If I solve this problem for him, the world will seem all empty and vain. I will tell him for this time the nature of upright and holy ascetic brahmins.&rdquo; With this intent he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;They on the earth, who hold the ascetic vows,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In yellow clad, not dwelling in a house,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who go forth early for to get their food,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11395"></a><span class="t12">Not in the afternoon:</span><a id="a11396"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16348"><span class="t19">{1007}</span></a><span class="t12"> these men are good. </span><span class="t18">[4.215]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. Visit in season such good men as these,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And question any one it shall you please:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They will explain the matter, for they know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">About the other world and this below.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11397"></a>Thus speaking, he terrified the man with the fear of hell. The other attained to the perfect state of a Paccekabodhisatta; for he lived with his knowledge on the point of ripening, like a ripe lotus bud looking for the touch of the sun&rsquo;s rays. As the hunter hearkened to his discourse, standing where he was, he understood all in a moment the constituent parts of existing things, grasped their three properties,<a id="a11398"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16350"><span class="t9">{1008}</span></a><a id="a11399"></a> and penetrated to the knowledge of a Paccekabuddha. This comprehension of his, and the setting free of the Great Being from the snare, came both in one instant. The Paccekabuddha, having annihilated his sensual desires and desires, standing on the uttermost verge of existence,<a id="a11400"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16352"><span class="t9">{1009}</span></a> uttered his exalted utterance in this verse: <span class="t18">{4.341}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;Like as the serpent casts his withered skin,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A tree her dry leaves when the green begin:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So I renounce my hunter&rsquo;s craft this day,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My hunter&rsquo;s craft for ever cast away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Having uttered this exalted utterance, he thought: &ldquo;I have just now been set free from the bonds of wrongdoing; but at home I have many a bird held fast in bondage, and how am I to set them free?&rdquo; So he asked the Great Being, &ldquo;King peacock, there are many birds I left in bondage at home, how can I set them free?&rdquo; Now the Bodhisattas, who are omniscient, have a better knowledge and comprehension of ways and means than a Paccekabuddha; therefore he answered, &ldquo;As you have broken the power of lust, and penetrated the knowledge of a Paccekabuddha, on that ground make an Assertion of Truth, and in all Jambudīpa there shall be no creature left in bonds.&rdquo; Then the other, entering by the door which the Bodhisatta thus opened for him, repeated this verse, making an Assertion of Truth:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;All those my feathered fowl that I did bind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hundreds and hundreds, in my house confined,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unto them all I give their life today,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And freedom: let them homewards fly away.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.342}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11401"></a>Then by his Assertion of Truth, though late, they were all set free from confinement, and twittering joyously went home to their own places. At the same moment throughout all Jambudīpa all creatures bound were set free, and not one was left in bondage, not so much as a cat. The Paccekabuddha uplifted his hand, and rubbed his forehead: immediately the family mark disappeared, and the mark of an ascetic appeared in its place. He then, like an elder of sixty years, fully dressed, carrying the eight necessary things<a id="a11402"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16354"><span class="t9">{1010}</span></a> made a reverential obeisance to the royal peacock, <span class="t18">[4.216] </span>and walking around him right-wise, rose up in the air, and went away to the cavern on the peak of Mount Nanda. The peacock also, rising up from the snare, took his food and departed to the place in which he lived.</p>
<p class="p7">The last verse was repeated by the Teacher, telling how for seven years the hunter went about snare in hand, and was then set free from pain by the peacock king:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;The hunter traversed all the forest land</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To catch the lord of peacocks, snare in hand.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The glorious lord of peacocks he set free</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From pain, as soon as he was caught, like me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">Having ended this discourse, the Teacher declared the Truths. Now at the conclusion of the Truths, the discontented monk became an Arahat, then he identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;At that time I was the peacock king.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present two monks are heard discussing the best strategy to capture the king&rsquo;s enemy, and following it the king succeeds in doing just that. The Buddha tells a story of a clever boar who manages to overcome a tiger, and catch the false ascetic who trained him.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;I wandered, searching far.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about two ancient elders.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11414"></a><span class="t30">Mahākosala, they say, in giving his daughter to king Bimbisāra,</span><a id="a11415"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16356"><span class="t9">{1011}</span></a><span class="t30"> allotted her a village of Kāsi for dowry. </span><span class="t18">{4.343}</span><a id="a11416"></a><span class="t30"> After Ajātasattu had murdered his father,</span><a id="a11417"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16358"><span class="t9">{1012}</span></a><span class="t30"> king Pasenadi destroyed that village. In the battles betwixt them for it, victory at the first lay with Ajātasattu. And the king of Kosala, having the worst, asked his councillors, &ldquo;What can we devise to take Ajātasattu?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Great king, the monks have great skill of magical charms. Send messengers to them, and get the opinion of the monks at the monastery.&rdquo; This pleased the king. Accordingly, he caused men to be sent, bidding them go there, and hiding themselves, overhear what the monks should say.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11418"></a><a id="a11419"></a><span class="t30">Now at Jetavana are many king&rsquo;s officers who have renounced the world. Two among these, a pair of old elders, dwelt in a leaf hut on the outskirts of the monastery: the name of one of them was elder Dhanuggahatissa, of the other the elder Mantidatta. These had slept all the night through, and awoke at peep of day. The elder Dhanuggahatissa said, as he kindled the fire, &ldquo;Elder Datta, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you asleep?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I am not asleep: what&rsquo;s to do now?&rdquo; &ldquo;A born fool that king of Kosala is; all he knows is how to eat a mess of food.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;He lets himself be beaten by Ajātasattu, who is no better than a worm in his own belly.&rdquo; &ldquo;What should he do, then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, elder Datta, you know the order of battle is of three kinds: Wagon Battle, Wheel Battle, and Lotus Battle.</span><a id="a11420"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16360"><span class="t9">{1013}</span></a><span class="t30"> It is the Wagon Battle he ought to use in order to catch Ajātasattu. Let him post valiant men on his two flanks on the hill-top, and then show his main battle in front: once he gets in between, out with a shout and a leap, and they have him like a fish </span><span class="t18">[4.217] </span><span class="t30">in a lobster-pot. That is the way to catch him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now all this the messengers heard; and then went back and told the king. He immediately set out with a great host, and took Ajātasattu prisoner, and bound him in chains. After punishing him thus for some days, he released him, advising him not to do it again, and by way of consolation gave him his own daughter, the princess Vajirā, in marriage, and finally dismissed him with great pomp.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">There was much gossip about it among the monks indoors, &ldquo;Ajātasattu was caught by the king of Kosala, through following the directions of elder Dhanuggahatissa!&rdquo; They talked of the same in the Dhamma Hall, and the Teacher entering, asked them what the talk was. They told him. Then he said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that Dhanuggahatissa has shown himself expert in strategy.&rdquo; And he told them a story.</span><span class="t18"> {4.344}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, a carpenter, who dwelt in a village nearby the city gate of Benares, went into the forest to cut wood. He found a young boar fallen into a pit, which he brought home and reared, naming him Carpenter&rsquo;s Boar. The boar became his servant; trees he turned over with his snout, and brought to him, he hitched the measuring-line around his tusk and pulled it along, fetched and carried adze, chisel, and mallet in his teeth.</p>
<p class="p7">When he grew up, he was a monstrous burly beast. The carpenter, who loved him as his own son, and feared lest someone might do him a mischief there, let him go free in the forest. The boar thought: &ldquo;I cannot live alone by myself in this forest: what if I search out my kindred, and live in their midst?&rdquo; So he sought all through that multitude of trees for boars, until seeing a herd of them, he was glad, and recited three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;I wandered, searching far and wide the woods and hills around:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I wandered, searching for my kin: and lo, my kin are found!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Here are abundant roots and fruits, with plenteous store of food;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What lovely hills and pleasant rills! To dwell here will be good.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Here will I dwell with all my kin, not anxious, at my ease,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11421"></a><span class="t12">Having no trouble, fearing nought from any enemies.&rdquo;</span><a id="a11422"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16362"><span class="t19">{1014}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">The boars on hearing this verse responded with the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;A foe is here! Some other where take refuge, go your ways:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11423"></a><span class="t12">Ever the choicest of the herd, O Carpenter,</span><a id="a11424"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16364"><span class="t19">{1015}</span></a><span class="t12"> he slays!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Who is that foe? Come tell me true, my kindred, so well met,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who does destroy you? Though he has not quite destroyed you yet.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.345}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;A king of beasts! Striped up and down he is, with teeth to bite:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ever the choicest of the herd he slays &ndash; a beast of might!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.218]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;And have our bodies lost their strength? Have we no tusks to show?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We shall o&rsquo;ercome him if we work together: only so.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Sweet words to hear, O Carpenter, of which my heart is fain:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let no boar flee! Or he shall be after the battle slain!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11425"></a>Carpenter&rsquo;s Boar now having made them all of one mind asked, &ldquo;At what time will the tiger come?&rdquo; &ldquo;Today he came early in the morning and took one, tomorrow he will come early in the morning.&rdquo; The boar was skilled in warfare, and knew the place of advantage to take, so that victory might be won. He searched about for a place, and made them take food while it was yet night; then very early in the morning, he explained to them how the order of battle is of three kinds, the Wagon Battle, and so forth; after which he arranged the Lotus<a id="a11426"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16366"><span class="t9">{1016}</span></a> Battle in this manner. In the midst he placed the sucking pigs, and around them their mothers, next to these the barren sows, next a circle of young porkers, next the young ones with tusks just budding, next the big tuskers, and the old boars outside all. Then he posted smaller squads of ten, twenty, thirty apiece here and there. He made them dig a pit for himself, and for the tiger to fall into a hole of the shape of a winnowing basket; between the two holes was left a spit of ground for himself to stand on. Then he with the stout fighting-boars went around everywhere encouraging the boars.<span class="t18"> {4.346}</span></p>
<p class="p7">As he was thus engaged the sun rose. The tiger, coming forth from the hermitage of a sham ascetic, appeared upon the hill-top. The boars cried, &ldquo;Our enemy is come, sir!&rdquo; &ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whatever he does, you do the same.&rdquo; The tiger gave himself a shake, and as though about to depart, made water; the boars did the same. The tiger looked at the boars and roared a great roar; they did the same. Observing what they were at, he thought: &ldquo;They have changed somehow; today they face me out as enemies, in orderly bands: some warrior has been mustering them; I must not go near them today.&rdquo; In fear of death he turned tail, and fled to the sham ascetic; and he, seeing the tiger empty-handed, recited the ninth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;Have you abjured all killing? Have you sworn</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11427"></a><span class="t12">Safety for every living creature born?</span><a id="a11428"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16368"><span class="t19">{1017}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Surely your teeth their wonted virtue lack.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You find a herd, and come a beggar back!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The tiger thereupon repeated three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;My teeth no longer bite,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My strength exhausted quite:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brother by brother all together stood:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Therefore I wander lonely in the wood. </span><span class="t18">[4.219]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. Once they would hurry-scurry all about</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To find their holes, a panic-stricken rout.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But now they grunt in serried ranks compact:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11429"></a><span class="t12">Invincible, they stand and face me out.</span><a id="a11430"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16370"><span class="t19">{1018}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{4.347}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. They all agree together now, a leader they have got;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When all agree they may hurt me: therefore I want them not.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this the sham ascetic replied with the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;Alone the hawk subdues the birds, alone</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The Asuras are by Sakka overthrown:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And when a herd of beasts the mighty tiger sees,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ever the best he picks, and kills them at his ease.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the tiger recited one:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;No hawk, no tiger lord of beasts, not Sakka can command</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11431"></a><span class="t12">A kindred host that tiger-like</span><a id="a11432"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16372"><span class="t19">{1019}</span></a><span class="t12"> combine to make a stand.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thereat the sham ascetic, to egg him on, recited two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;The little tiny feathered fowl in flocks and coveys fly,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In heaps together up they rise, together skim the sky.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. Down stoops the hawk, and all alone, down on them as they play,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Harries and kills them at his will: that is your tiger&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.348}</span></p>
<p class="p6">This said, he further encouraged him, &ldquo;Royal tiger, you know not your own power. One roar only, and a spring &ndash; there will not be two of them left together, I dare swear!&rdquo; The tiger did so.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher said a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;Then he with cruel greedy eye, deeming these words were true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Took heart, and with his fangs all bare leaped on the tuskèd crew.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Well, the tiger went back and stood there awhile on the hill. The boars told Carpenter&rsquo;s Boar that he was come again. &ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; said he, comforting them, and then took his stand upon the ridge between the two pits. The tiger with all speed sprang towards the boar, but the boar rolled tail over snout in the first hole. The tiger could not check his onset, and fell all of a heap into the pit shaped like to a winnowing fan. Up jumped the boar in a trice, buried his tusks in the tiger&rsquo;s thigh, pierced him to the heart, devoured the flesh, bit at him, bundled him over into the further pit, crying, &ldquo;There, take the rogue!&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.349}</span> They who came first got one chance apiece of eating a mouthful, those who came later went about asking, &ldquo;How does tiger&rsquo;s-meat taste?&rdquo; <span class="t18">[4.220]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Carpenter&rsquo;s Boar came out of the pit, and, looking round upon the others, said: &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo; But they answered, &ldquo;My lord, you have done for the tiger, and that&rsquo;s one; but there is another left worse than ten tigers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is that, pray?&rdquo; &ldquo;A sham ascetic, who eats the meat which the tiger brings him from time to time.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come along then, and we will catch him.&rdquo; So they quickly sprang off together.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the sham ascetic was watching the road, and expecting the tiger to come any minute. And what should he see coming but the boars! &ldquo;They have killed the tiger, I think, and now they are come to kill me!&rdquo; Away he ran, and climbed up a wild fig tree. &ldquo;He has climbed a tree!&rdquo; said the boars to their leader. &ldquo;What tree?&rdquo; &ldquo;A fig tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right, we shall have him directly.&rdquo; He made the young boars grub away the earth from its roots, and the sows bring each as much water as their mouths would hold, till there the tree stood upright bare down to the roots. Then he sent the others out of the way, and, going down on his knees, struck at the roots with his tusk: clean through the root he cut, as with an axe, down came the tree, but the man never got as far as the ground: he was torn to pieces and eaten on the way. Observing this marvel, the Tree Devatā recited a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. &ldquo;United friends, like forest trees &ndash; it is a pleasant sight;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The boars united, at one charge the tiger killed outright.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And the Teacher recited another verse, how that both of them were destroyed:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. &ldquo;The brahmin and the tiger both thus did the boars destroy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And roared a loud and echoing roar in their exceeding joy.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.350}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11433"></a>Again the boar asked, &ldquo;And have you another foe?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; they replied. Then they proposed to sprinkle him for their king. Water was fetched. Espying the shell which the sham ascetic used for his drinking, which was a precious conch with the spiral turned right-wise,<a id="a11434"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16374"><span class="t9">{1020}</span></a> they filled it with water, and consecrated Carpenter&rsquo;s Boar there on the root of the fig tree, there the water of consecration was poured upon him. A young sow they made his consort. Hence arose the custom which still prevails, that in consecrating a king they seat him upon a chair of fig-wood, and sprinkle him from a conch with spirals that run to the right. <span class="t18">[4.221]</span></p>
<p class="p7">This also the Teacher explained by reciting the last verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. &ldquo;The boars beneath the wild fig tree the holy water poured,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Upon the Carpenter, and cried, you are our king and lord!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">When he had ended this discourse, the Teacher said: &ldquo;No, monks, this is not the first time that Dhanuggahatissa has shown himself clever in strategy, but he was the same before.&rdquo; With these words, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Devadatta was the sham ascetic, Dhanuggahatissa Carpenter&rsquo;s Boar, and I myself was the Tree Devatā.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present some merchants after worshipping the Buddha go on a journey and find a magic tree which gives them all they could desire. The Buddha tells a similar story from the past, but there the merchants in their greed wanted to cut the tree down at the root, and the deity living there saw to it they were all destroyed.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the caravan leader (satthavāha),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Sāriputta = the King of the Nāgas (Nāgarājā).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11440"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Greed, Content, Gratitude, Devas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Merchants from many.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about some traders who lived in Sāvatthi. These, we hear, when going away bent on business, came with gifts to the Teacher, sheltering themselves in the Refuges and the Precepts. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;if we return safe and sound, we will worship your feet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">With five hundred cartloads of merchandise they set out, and came soon to a wild forest, where they could see no road. Astray, waterless and without food, they traversed the forest until, seeing a huge banyan tree which was haunted by Nāgas, they unyoked the carts and sat down beneath it. Looking upon its leaves, they saw them all glossy as though wet with water, and the branches seemed to be full of water, which made them think thus, &ldquo;It appears as though water were running through this tree. What if we cut a branch of it facing the east? We shall find something to drink.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.351}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11441"></a><span class="t30">After this, one climbed up the tree and cut off a branch: out gushed a stream of water thick as a palm-trunk, and in this they washed, of this they drank. Next they cut a branch on the southern side: out from it came all manner of choice food, and they ate of it. They then cut a branch on the west side of the tree: out sprang women fair and beauteously adorned, with whom they took their pleasure. Lastly, they cut one of the northern branches: from it fell the seven previous things, and they took them and filled the five hundred carts, and returned to Sāvatthi. There they caused the treasure to be carefully guarded.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11442"></a><a id="a11443"></a><span class="t30">Bearing in their hands garlands and perfumes and the like, they repaired to Jetavana and saluted the Teacher and paid worship to him, and then sat on one side. That day they listened to the preaching of the Dhamma; and the next, they brought a munificent present, and renounced the merit of the whole, saying: &ldquo;The merit of this gift, sir, we renounce in favour of a Tree Devatā who gave us the whole treasure.&rdquo; The meal finished, the Teacher asked them, &ldquo;What Tree Devatā do you give this merit to?&rdquo; The merchants told the Tathāgata the manner how they had received the treasure by a banyan tree. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;This treasure you have received for your moderation, and because you have not given yourselves into the power of desire; but in former days men were immoderate, and were in the power of desire, and thereby they lost treasure and life both.&rdquo; Then at their request he told them a story.</span><span class="t18"> [4.222]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11444"></a>In the past nearby<a id="a11445"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16376"><span class="t9">{1021}</span></a> Benares was this same wild forest and this same banyan tree. The merchants strayed from the way and saw the banyan tree.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, after Fully Awakening, explained the matter in these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Merchants from many a kingdom came, and all together met,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Chose them a chief, and straight set out a treasure for to get.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. To this parched forest, poor in food, their way the travellers made,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And spied a mighty banyan tree with cool and pleasant shade.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. There underneath that shady tree those merchants all did sit,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And reasoned thus, with folly clothed and poverty of wit:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Full moist the tree is, and it seems as water there did flow:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;One of the branches let us cut which to the eastwards grow.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. The branch was cut; then pure and clear the trickling waters flow:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The merchants washed, the merchants drank till they had drunk enow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Again in poverty of wit, with folly clothed, they say:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;One of the branches on the south come let us cut away.&rsquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.352}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. This branch being cut, both rice and meat out in a stream it brings,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thick porridge, ginger, lentil soup and many other things.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. The merchants ate, the merchants drank, they took their fill of it,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then said again, with folly clothed, in poverty of wit:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &lsquo;Come, fellow-merchants, let us cut a western branch away.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Out came a bevy of fair girls all pranked in brave array.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. And O the robes of many hues, jewels and rings in plenty!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Each merchant had a pretty maid, each of the five and twenty.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. These all together stood around beneath the leafy shade:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">These and the merchants in the midst, much merriment they made.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. Again in poverty of wit, with folly clothed, they say,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;One of the branches on the north come let us cut away.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. But when the northern branch was cut, out came a stream of gold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Silver in handfuls, precious rugs, and jewels manifold;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. And robes of fine Benares cloth, and blankets thick and thin.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The merchants then to roll them up in bundles did begin.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. Again they said in witlessness and folly, as before:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">C&lsquo;ome let us cut it by the root, and then we may get more.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. O then uprose their chief, and said, with a respectful bow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;What mischief does the banyan do, good sirs? God bless you now!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. The eastern branch gave water-streams, the southern gave us food,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The western gave us pretty maids, the northern all things good:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What mischief does the banyan do, good sirs? God bless you now!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. The tree that gives you pleasant shade, to sit or lie at need,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You should not tear its branches down, a cruel, wanton deed.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. But they were many, he was one whose voice forbade them do&rsquo;t:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They struck the whetted axes in to fell it by the root.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [4.223] {4.353}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Nāga king, who saw them draw near to the root that they might fell the tree, thought to himself, &ldquo;I gave these fellows water to drink when they were thirsty, then I gave them food divine, then beds to lie on and maidens to attend them, then treasures to fill five hundred wagons, and now they say, &lsquo;Let us cut down the tree from the root! Greedy they are beyond bounds, and except the chief of the caravan they shall all die.&rsquo; &rdquo; Then he mustered an army, &ldquo;So many armed in mail stand forth, so many archers, so many with sword and shield.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this the Teacher repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. &ldquo;Then five and twenty mail-clad snakes stood forth and took the field,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Three hundred bowmen, and six thousand armed with sword and shield.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.354}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The following verse is said by the Nāga king:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. &ldquo;Strike down the men, and bind them fast, spare not the life of one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Burn them to cinders save the chief, and then your task is done.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And so did the serpents. Then they loaded the rugs from the northern branch and all the rest of it upon the five hundred wagons, and conveyed the wagons and the chief of the caravan to Benares, and put up the goods in his house, and taking leave of him returned to their own place of abode.</p>
<p class="p7">When the Teacher had seen this, he repeated two verses of admonition:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;So let the wise his own good see, and let him never go</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A slave to greed, that he disarm the purpose of his foe.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Shake off desire and fetters, and to holy life aspire.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">Having ended this discourse, he said: &ldquo;Thus, monks, in days of yore merchants possessed with greed came to dire destruction, therefore you must not give place to greed.&rdquo; Then having declared the Truths; and at the conclusion of the Truths those merchants became established in the fruit of the First Path, and he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Sāriputta was the king of the Serpents, and I was the caravan chief.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present some lay people take on the Uposatha precepts.

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;A wonder in the world.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{4.355}</span><span class="t30">This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about lay brethren who took on the Uposatha precepts. On that occasion the Teacher said: &ldquo;Lay brethren, wise men of old, by virtue of their keeping the Uposatha precepts, went in the body to heaven, and there dwelt for a long time.&rdquo; Then at their request, he told a story of the past.</span><span class="t18"> [4.224]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, there was a king Sādhīna in Mithilā, who reigned in righteousness. At the four city gates, and in the midst of it, and at his own palace door he caused to be made six alms halls, and with his generosity made a great stir through all Jambudīpa. Daily six hundred thousand pieces were spent in alms: he kept the five precepts, he observed the Uposatha precepts; and they of the city also, following his admonitions, gave alms and did good, and as they died, came to life at once in the city of the gods.</p>
<p class="p7">The princes of heaven, sitting in full conclave in Sakka&rsquo;s justice hall, praised Sādhīna&rsquo;s virtuous life and goodness. The report of him made all the other gods desirous to see him. Sakka, King of the Devas, perceiving their mind, asked, &ldquo;Do you wish to see king Sādhīna?&rdquo; They replied, yes they did. Then he commanded Mātali, &ldquo;Go to my palace Vejayanta, yoke my chariot, and bring Sādhīna here.&rdquo; He obeyed the command and yoked the chariot, and went to the kingdom of Videha.</p>
<p class="p7">It was then the day of full moon. At the time when people had partaken of their evening meal, and were sitting by their doors at their ease, Mātali drove his chariot side by side with the moon&rsquo;s disk. All the people called out, &ldquo;See, two moons are in the sky!&rdquo; But when they saw the chariot pass by the moon, and come towards them, then they cried, &ldquo;It is no moon, but a chariot; a Devaputta, it would seem. For whom is he bringing this divine carriage, with his team of thoroughbreds, creatures of the imagination? Will it not be for our king? Yes, our king is a righteous and good king!&rdquo; In their delight they joined hands with reverence, and standing repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;A wonder in the world was seen, that made the hair uprise:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For great Videha&rsquo;s king is sent a chariot from the skies!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.356}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Mātali brought the carriage close, and then while the people worshipped with flowers and perfumes, he drove it thrice round the city right-wise. Then he proceeded to the king&rsquo;s door, and there stayed the chariot, and stood still before the western window, making a sign that he should ascend. Now that day the king himself had inspected his alms halls, and had given directions how they were to distribute; which done, he took on him the Uposatha precepts, and thus spent the day. Just then he was seated on a gorgeous dais, facing the eastern window, with his courtiers all around, discoursing to them on right and justice. At that moment Mātali invited him to enter the chariot, and having done this went away with him.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher repeated the following verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;The Devaputta Mātali, the charioteer, did bring</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A summons to Vedeha, who in Mithilā was king: </span><span class="t18">[4.225]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &lsquo;O mighty monarch, noble king, mount in this car with me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sakka would see you, and the gods, the glorious Thirty-Three,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And now they sit in a meeting all, bethinking them of you.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Then king Sādhīna turned his face, and mounted in the car;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which with its thousand steeds then bore him to the gods afar.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. The gods beheld the king arrive, and then, their guest to greet</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cried, &lsquo;Welcome mighty monarch, whom we are so glad to meet!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O king! Beside the king of gods we pray you take a seat.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. And Sakka welcomed Vedeha, the king of Mithilā town,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11456"></a><span class="t12">Ay, Vāsava</span><a id="a11457"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16378"><span class="t19">{1022}</span></a><span class="t12"> offered him all joys, and prayed him to sit down.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Amid the rulers of the world O welcome to our land:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Dwell with the gods, O king! Who have all wishes at command,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Enjoy immortal pleasures, where the Three-and-Thirty stand.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.357}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11458"></a>Sakka, King of the Devas, gave him half of the city of the gods, ten thousand leagues in extent, and half of twenty-five millions of Accharā, and half of the palace Vejayanta. And there he dwelt for seven hundred years by man&rsquo;s reckoning, enjoying felicity. But then his merit was exhausted in that character in heaven dissatisfaction arose in him, and so he spoke to Sakka in these words, repeating a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;I joyed, when time to heaven I came,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In dances, song and music clear:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now I no longer feel the same.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is my life done, does death draw near,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or is it folly, king, that I must fear?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka said to him:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;Your life&rsquo;s not done, and death is far,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor are you foolish, mighty one:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But your good deeds exhausted are</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And now your merit is all done.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Still here abide, O mighty king, by my divine command;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11459"></a><span class="t12">Enjoy immortal pleasures, where the Three-and-Thirty stand.&rdquo;</span><a id="a11460"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16380"><span class="t19">{1023}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{4.358}</span></p>
<p class="p6">But the Great Being refused, and said to him:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;As when a chariot, or when goods are given on demand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So is it to enjoy a bliss given by another&rsquo;s hand.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. I care not blessings to receive given by another&rsquo;s hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My goods are mine and mine alone when on my deeds I stand.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. I&rsquo;ll go and do much good to men, give alms throughout the land,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Will follow virtue, exercise control and self-command:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He that so acts is happy, and fears no remorse at hand.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, Sakka then gave orders to Mātali, &ldquo;Go now, convey king Sādhīna to Mithilā, and set him down in his own park.&rdquo; He did so. The king walked to and fro in his park; the park-keeper espied <span class="t18">[4.226] </span>him, and, after asking him who he was, went to king Nārada with the news. When he learned of the king&rsquo;s arrival, he sent on the keeper with these words, &ldquo;You go on before, and prepare two seats, one for him and one for me.&rdquo; He did so. Then the king asked him, &ldquo;For whom do you prepare these two seats?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;One for you, and one for our king.&rdquo; Then the king said: &ldquo;What other being shall sit down in my presence?&rdquo; He sat upon one seat, and put his feet on the other. King Nārada came up, and having saluted his feet, sat down on one side: now it is said he was the seventh in direct descent from the king, and at that time the age of man was one hundred years. So long was the time which the Great Being had spent, by the might of his goodness. He took Nārada by the hands, and, going up and down in the pleasure gardens, recited three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;Here are the lands, the conduit round through which the waters go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The green grass clothing it about, the rivulets that flow, </span><span class="t18">{4.359}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. The lovely lakes, that listen when the ruddy geese give call,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11461"></a><span class="t12">Where lotus white and lotus blue and trees like coral</span><a id="a11462"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16382"><span class="t19">{1024}</span></a><span class="t12"> grow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ndash; But those who loved this place with me, O say, where are they all?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. These are the acres, this the place,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The pleasure gardens and the fields are here:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But seeing no familiar face,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To me it seems a desert drear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hereupon Nārada said to him, &ldquo;My lord, since you departed to the world of the gods seven hundred years have gone by; I am the seventh in line from you, your attendants have all gone down into the jaws of death. But this is your own rightful realm, and I beg you receive it.&rdquo; The king answered, &ldquo;My dear Nārada, I came here not to be king, but to do good I came here, and good I will do.&rdquo; He then said as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;Celestial mansions I have seen, shining in every place,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11463"></a><span class="t12">The Thirty-Three I have seen, and their monarch, face to face.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. Joys more than human I have felt, a heavenly home was mine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With all that heart could wish, among the Thirty-Three divine.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. This I have seen, and to do deeds of virtue I came down:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And I will live a holy life, I want no royal crown.</span><a id="a11464"></a><span class="t18"> {4.360}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. The path that never leads to woe, the path the Buddhas show,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Upon that path I enter now by which the holy go.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So spake the Great Being, by his omniscience compressing all into these verses. Then Nārada again said to him, &ldquo;Take the rule of the kingdom upon you,&rdquo; and he replied, &ldquo;My dear son, I want no kingdom; but for seven days I wish to distribute again the alms given during these seven hundred years.&rdquo; Nārada was willing, and doing as he was <span class="t18">[4.227] </span>requested, prepared a vast largess for distribution. For seven days the king gave alms; and on the seventh day he died, and was born in the heaven of the Thirty-Three.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: &ldquo;Such is the performance of the Uposatha precepts which it is duty to keep,&rdquo; and declared the Truths; now at the conclusion of the Truths, some of the lay brethren entered on the fruition of the First Path, and some of the Second, and he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was king Nārada, Anuruddha was Sakka, and I myself was the king Sādhīna.&rdquo;</span></p>
