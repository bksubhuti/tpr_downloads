<p class="p7"><a id="a11732"></a><span class="t15">In the present the Buddha praises keeping the Uposatha precepts. He then tells a story of a Nāga king who allowed himself to be captured rather than break his vows. He was then displayed before the king, to whom he explained how it was he was caught.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a11733"></a><a id="a11734"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the Nāga king Campeyya (Campeyyanāgarājā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Rāhulamātā = (Nāga queen) Sumanā,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Sāriputta = Uggasena (the king of Benares),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Who is it like.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[4.281] </span><span class="t30">This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about the Uposatha precepts. The Teacher said: &ldquo;It is well done, lay brethren, that you have taken upon you the Uposatha precepts. Wise men of old likewise even renounced the glory of being a Nāga king, and lived under these vows.&rdquo; Then at their request he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Aṅga was king in the kingdom of Aṅga, and Magadha king in Magadha, betwixt the realms of Aṅga and Magadha was the river Campā, where was a place where serpents dwelt, and here a serpent king Campeyya held sway.</p>
<p class="p7">Sometimes king Magadha took the Aṅga country, sometimes king Aṅga took Magadha. One day king Magadha, having fought a battle with Aṅga and got the worse, mounted his charger and took to flight, pursued by Aṅga&rsquo;s warriors. When he came to the Campā river, it was in flood. But he said: &ldquo;Better death drowned in this river than death at the hands of my enemies!&rdquo; Then man and horse plunged in the stream.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the serpent king Campeyya had built under the water a jewelled pavilion; and there at this moment in the midst of his court he was carousing deep. But the king and his horse plunged into the river just in front of the Nāga king. The serpent, beholding this magnificent monarch, conceived a liking for him. Rising from his seat, he made the king sit down upon his own throne, bidding him fear nought, and asked why he came plunging into the water. The king told him all as it was. Then said the serpent, &ldquo;Fear nothing, O great king! I will make you master of both kingdoms.&rdquo; Thus he consoled him, and for seven days he showed him high honour.</p>
<p class="p7">On the seventh day he with king Magadha left the serpent palace. Then by the Nāga king&rsquo;s power, king Magadha got possession of king Aṅga, and slew him, and ruled over the two realms together. From that time there was a firm bond between him and the Nāga king. <span class="t18">{4.455}</span> Year by year he caused a jewelled pavilion to be built on the bank of the river Campā, and offered tribute to the Nāga king at great cost: the Nāga king would come forth with a large retinue from his palace to receive the tribute, and all the people beheld the glory of the Nāga king. <span class="t18">[4.282]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11736"></a>At that time the Bodhisatta was one of a poor family, and he used to go down with the king&rsquo;s people to the riverside. There seeing the Nāga king&rsquo;s glory, he became covetous of it; and in this desire<a id="a11737"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16501"><span class="t9">{1082}</span></a><a id="a11738"></a> he died, and seven days after the death of the serpent king Campeyya, the Bodhisatta, having given alms and lived a virtuous life, came into being in his palace on his royal couch: his body was like a great festoon of jasmine. When he saw it, he was filled with remorse. &ldquo;As a consequence of my good deeds,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have power laid up in the six chief worlds of sense,<a id="a11739"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16503"><span class="t9">{1083}</span></a> as corn is laid up in a granary. But see, here am I born in this reptile shape; what care I for life!&rdquo; And so he had thoughts of putting an end to himself. But a young female serpent, named Sumanā, seeing him, gave the lead to the rest, &ldquo;This must be Sakka, mighty in power, born here to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then they all came and made offering to him, with all manner of musical instruments in their hands. That serpent&rsquo;s palace of his became as it were the palace of Sakka, the thought of death left him: he put off his serpent shape, and sat on the couch in magnificence of dress and adornment. From that time great was his glory, and he ruled over the serpents. Another time again he repented, thinking: &ldquo;What care I for this reptile shape? I will live under the Uposatha precepts, and from this place I will shake myself free, amongst men I will go, and learn the Truths, and I will make an end of pain.&rdquo; But afterwards he still remained in that same palace, fulfilling the Uposatha precepts, and when the young female serpents came about him all gaily adorned, he generally violated his rule of virtue. After that he went forth from the palace into the park, but they followed him there, and his vow was broken as before.</p>
<p class="p7">Then he thought: &ldquo;I must leave this palace, and go into the world of men, and there must I live under the Uposatha precepts.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.456}</span><a id="a11740"></a><a id="a11741"></a> So then on the Uposathas he went forth from the palace, and lay on the top of an antheap by the high road, not far from a frontier village. Said he, &ldquo;Those who desire my skin or any part of me, let them take it; or if any would have me a dancing snake, let them make me so.&rdquo; Thus did he yield his body as a gift, and contracting his hood he lay there observing the Uposatha precepts.</p>
<p class="p7">Those who went to and fro on the highway espying him, did him worship with scents and perfumes. And the dwellers in that frontier village, holding him to be a serpent king of great power, set up a pavilion over him, spread sand before it, did worship with perfumes and scented things. Now people began to crave sons by his aid, having faith in the Great Being and doing him worship. The Great Being kept there the Uposatha precepts on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the half-moon, lying upon the antheap; and on the first day of the lunar half he would return to his palace; and, as he thus fulfilled his vows, time went by. <span class="t18">[4.283]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11742"></a><a id="a11743"></a><a id="a11744"></a>One day his consort Sumanā spoke to him thus, &ldquo;My lord, you are wont to go among men to keep your Uposatha precepts. The world of men is dangerous, full of fear. Suppose some danger should come upon you, tell me now by what sign I shall learn of it.&rdquo; Then the Great Being led her to the side of a lucky pond, and said: &ldquo;If any one strike me or do me hurt, the water in this pond will become turbid. If a Supaṇṇa bird carry me off, the water will disappear. If a snake-charmer seize me, the water will turn to the colour of blood.&rdquo; These three signs explained to her, he went forth from his palace to keep the Uposatha of the fourteenth day, went and lay down on the antheap, illuminating the antheap with the sheen of his body. White was his body as a coil of pure silver, like a ball of red wool was his head: now in this Jātaka the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s body was thick as a plough-head, in the Bhūridattajātaka [Ja 543] thick as a thigh, in the Saṅkhapālajātaka [Ja 546] as big and round as a trough-canoe with an outrigger.</p>
<p class="p7">In those days there was a young brahmin of Benares come to Taxila to study at the feet of a world-renowned teacher, from whom <span class="t18">{4.457}</span><a id="a11745"></a> he had learned the charm which commands all things of sense. Going home along that road, what should he see but the Great Being. &ldquo;This snake I will catch,&rdquo; thinks he, &ldquo;and I will travel through town and village and royal city, making him dance and amassing great profits.&rdquo; Then he procured magical herbs, and repeating the magic charm he approached the snake. No sooner he heard the sound of this charm, than the Great Being felt his ears as it were pierced by burning splinters, his head was as though broken by the blow of a sword. &ldquo;What have we here!&rdquo; thought he; putting forth his head from the hood, he beheld the snake-charmer. Then he thought: &ldquo;My poison is powerful, and if I am angry and send forth the breath of my nostrils<a id="a11746"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16505"><span class="t9">{1084}</span></a> his body will be shattered and scattered like a fist-full of chaff; but then my virtue will be broken. I will not look upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Closing his eyes he drew his head within the hood. The brahmin snake-charmer ate a herb, repeated his charm, spat upon him: by virtue of herb and charm, wherever the spittle touched him, blains arose. Then the man seized him by the tail, dragged him, laid him out at full length: with a goat&rsquo;s-foot staff he squeezed him till he was weak, then catching tight hold on his head, crushed him hard. The Great Being opened his mouth wide; the man dropped spittle in it, and by the herb and charm broke his teeth; the mouth was full of blood. But the Great Being so feared lest he break his virtue, that he bore all this torment and never so much as opened an eye to glance at him.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the man said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll weaken this royal snake!&rdquo; From tail to head he squeezed the snake&rsquo;s body as though he would crush his very bones to powder. Then he wrapped him in <span class="t18">[4.284] </span><a id="a11747"></a>what they call the cloth-wrap, gave him what they call the rope-rubbing, caught him by the tail and gave him the cotton blow, as they call it.<a id="a11748"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16507"><span class="t9">{1085}</span></a> The Great Being&rsquo;s body was all smeared with blood, and he was in great pain. Seeing that the serpent was now weak, <span class="t18">{4.458}</span><a id="a11749"></a> the man made a cane basket in which he laid the snake. Then he carried him to the village, and made him perform to the crowd. Black or blue or what not, round figure and square figure, little or large &ndash; whatever the brahmin desired, that the Great Being will do, dancing, spreading his hood as if by hundreds or by thousands.<a id="a11750"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16509"><span class="t9">{1086}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">The people were so pleased that they gave much money: in one day he would take a thousand rupees, and things worth another thousand. At first the man had intended to let him go free when he should gain a thousand pieces of money; but when he got it, he thought: &ldquo;In a small frontier village I have gained all this; from kings and courtiers how much wealth may I look to win!&rdquo; So he bought a cart and a pleasure-carriage, and in the cart loaded his goods, while he sat in the carriage. Thus with an attendant throng he traversed town and village, making the Great Being perform, and went on with the intent to show him off before king Uggasena in Benares; and then he would let him go.</p>
<p class="p7">He used to kill frogs and give them to the royal snake. But the snake each time refused to eat, that none might be killed for his sake. Then the man gave him honey and fried corn. But the Great Being refused to eat these also; for he thought: &ldquo;If I take food, I shall be in this basket till I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">In a month&rsquo;s time the brahmin was come to Benares. There he got much money by making the snake perform in the villages beyond the gates. The king also sent for him, and commanded a performance: the man promised this for the morrow, which was the last day of the half-month. Then the king sent a drum beating about the city, with proclamation, that on the morrow a royal snake would dance in the palace court; let the people then gather to see it in their multitudes.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day the courtyard of the palace was adorned, and the brahmin summoned. He brought in the Great Being in a jewelled basket on a bright rug, which he set down, and himself took a seat. &ldquo;The king came down from the upper storey, and sat on his royal seat in the midst of a great concourse of people. The brahmin took out the Great Being, and made him dance. The people could not keep still: thousands of kerchiefs waved in the air; a shower of jewels in all seven kinds fell about the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p class="p7">It was now a full month since the Nāga was caught; and for all that time he had taken no food. <span class="t18">{4.459}</span> Now Sumanā began to think: <span class="t18">[4.285]</span> &ldquo;My dear husband tarries long. It is now a month since he has not returned; what can the matter be?&rdquo; So she went and looked at the pond: lo, the water was red as blood! Then she knew that he must have been caught by a snake-charmer. Forth from the palace she came, and to the antheap; she saw the place where he had been caught, and the place where he had been tormented, and she wept. Then she went to the frontier village, and enquired; and learning all the facts, she went on to Benares, and in the midst of the people, above the palace court in the air she stood now lamenting. The Great Being as he danced looked up in the air, and saw her, and being ashamed crept into his basket, and there he lay. When he crept into the basket, the king cried out, &ldquo;What is the matter now?&rdquo; Looking this way and that way, he saw her poised in the air, and recited the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Who is it like the lightning shines, or like a blazing star?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11751"></a><a id="a11752"></a><span class="t12">Devatā, </span><span class="t12">Gandhabbī</span><span class="t12">? I think no human thing you are.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Their conversation is given in the verses following:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;No Devī I, nor </span><span class="t12">Gandhabbī</span><span class="t12">, nor human, mighty king</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A female of the Nāga kind, come for a certain thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Full of wrath and rage you show,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From your eyes the teardrops flow:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Say what wrong or what desire</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brings you, lady? I would know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Crawling serpent, fierce as flame!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So they called him: one there came,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seized him for his profit, sire:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Freedom for my lord I claim!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;How could such a starveling wight</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Catch a creature full of might?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Daughter of the Nāgas, say,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How to discern the Nāga right?&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.460}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Such his might, that e&rsquo;en this town</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He could burn to cinders down.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But he loves the holy way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And seeks austerity&rsquo;s renown.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the king asked how the man had caught him. She replied in the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11753"></a><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;On holy days</span><a id="a11754"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16511"><span class="t19">{1087}</span></a><span class="t12"> the royal snake</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At the four-ways used to take</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Holy vows: a juggler caught him.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Free my husband for my sake!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After these words she added yet these other two verses, begging his release:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11755"></a><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Lo sixteen thousand women adorned with jewel and ring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beneath the waters counted him their refuge and their king. </span><span class="t18">[4.286]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Justly, gently set him free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11756"></a><span class="t12">Buy the Nāga liberty,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With gold, a hundred kine, a village:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11757"></a><span class="t12">That will merit win for you.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.461}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the king recited three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Justly now and gently see</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I buy the Nāga liberty</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With gold, a hundred kine, a village,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That will merit win for me.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. A jewelled earring give I you, a hundred drachms of gold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11758"></a><span class="t12">A lovely throne like flower of flax with cushions laid fourfold!</span><a id="a11759"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16513"><span class="t19">{1088}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. A bull, a hundred kine, two wives of equal birth with you:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Release the holy Nāga: the deed will meritorious be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this the hunter made reply:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;I want no gifts, your majesty,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11760"></a><span class="t12">But let the Nāga now go free.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus I now release the Nāga:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The deed will meritorious be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After this speech he took the Great Being out of his basket. The Nāga king came forth and crept into a flower, where he put off his shape and reappeared in the form of a young man magnificently arrayed: there he stood, as though he had cleft the earth and come through. And down from the sky came Sumanā, and stood beside him. The Nāga king stood reverently joining his hands in respect to the king.<span class="t18"> {4.462}</span></p>
<p class="p7">To make all clear, the Teacher recited two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;The Nāga king Campeyyaka addressed the king, now free:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O king of Kāsi, fostering lord, all honour now to ye!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I do you reverence, ere I go again my home to see.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. Superhuman beings may</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hardly win belief, they say.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you speak the truth, O Nāga,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where&rsquo;s your palace? Show the way.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But the Great Being, to make him believe, swore an oath as follows in these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;Should the wind move mountains high,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Moon and sun fall from the sky,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Flow upstream the running rivers,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I, O king! Could never lie.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. Split the sky, the sea run dry,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bounteous mother earth awry</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11761"></a><span class="t12">Crumpling</span><a id="a11762"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16515"><span class="t19">{1089}</span></a><span class="t12"> roll, uproot Mount Meru,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet I, O king, could not lie!&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [4.287]</span></p>
<p class="p6">But notwithstanding this assurance, he still disbelieved the Great Being, and said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. &ldquo;Superhuman beings may</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hardly win belief, they say.</span><span class="t18"> {4.463}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you speak the truth, O Nāga!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where&rsquo;s your palace? Show the way.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Again he repeated the same verse, adding, &ldquo;You must be grateful for the good deeds wrought by me, whether I should believe you to be right or not, however, that is for me to decide.&rdquo; This he made clear in the next verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. &ldquo;Deadly envenomed, full of might,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Quick in quarrel, shining bright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You are freed by me from prison:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then is gratitude my right.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being made oath thus to win his belief:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. &ldquo;He that will no thanks return,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Happiness should never learn:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He should die in basket-prison,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He in horrid hell should burn!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now the king believed him, and thanked him thus:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. &ldquo;As that vow of thine is true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Anger flee and hate eschew:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As we flee the fire in summer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11763"></a><span class="t12">May the Supaṇṇa-birds flee from you!&rdquo;</span><a id="a11764"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16517"><span class="t19">{1090}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being too on his part said another verse meaning to thank the king:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;As a mother would have done</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To an only well-loved son,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You are kind to all the Nāgas:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We will serve you, every one.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.464}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now the king eager to visit the Nāga&rsquo;s world, gave command that his army should be made ready to go in the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. &ldquo;Yoke the royal cars, and stand</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Trained Cambodian mules at hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Elephants in golden trappings:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We will visit Nāga-land!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The next is a verse spoken after Fully Awakening:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. &ldquo;Bounce the tabors, thump the drums,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Conch and cymbal sounds and thrums,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Glorious mid a host of women</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">See king Uggasena comes.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.288]</span></p>
<p class="p6">At the moment he left the city, the Great Being by his power made visible in the Nāga world an enclosing wall of seven precious things, and gate-towers, and all the road of approach to the abode of the Nāgas he made to be gloriously adorned. By this road the king with his following entered the palace, and saw a delightful spot with mansions in it.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. &ldquo;The lord of Kāsi saw the ground sprinkled with golden sand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11765"></a><span class="t12">Fair flowers of coral</span><a id="a11766"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16519"><span class="t19">{1091}</span></a><span class="t12"> strewn around, gold towers on every hand.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. So then the king did enter in Campeyya&rsquo;s halls divine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11767"></a><span class="t12">Which like the brazen thunderbolt</span><a id="a11768"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16521"><span class="t19">{1092}</span></a><span class="t12"> or ruddy sun did shine.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. Into Campeyya&rsquo;s halls divine the king his entrance made:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A thousand perfumes scent the air, a thousand trees give shade.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">28. Within Campeyya&rsquo;s palace once the king his step advanced,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Celestial harps made melody, fair Nāgakaññā danced.</span><span class="t18"> {4.465}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">29. He is shown a golden seat</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cushioned and with sandal sweet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where the bevy of fair maidens</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tread the halls with thronging feet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">No sooner was he there seated, than they set before him food divine of choice flavour, and they gave it also to the sixteen thousand women and to the rest of the company. For seven days he with his retinue partook of the divine food and drink, and enjoyed all manner of pleasure. Sitting in his fair seat he praised the glory of the Great Being. &ldquo;O king of the Nāgas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why did you leave all this magnificence, to lie on an ant-heap, in the world of men, and to keep the Uposatha precepts?&rdquo; The other told him.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">30. &ldquo;There the king in pleasure stayed.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To Campeyya then he said:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Glorious mansions these of thine!</span></p>

<p class="p6">To this answer the king replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. &ldquo;Bravely dressed, eyes red and bleared,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Broad-shouldered, shaven head, and beard,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How our world surpasses thine?&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.467}</span></p>
<p class="p6">This was answered by the Nāga king as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">39. &ldquo;Comes control and cleansing when</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">One is in the world of men,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Only there: once man, I&rsquo;ll never</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">See nor birth nor death again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The, king listened, and thus replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">40. &ldquo;Surely &rsquo;tis good to venerate the wise</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11773"></a><span class="t12">In whom deep wisdom and high thoughts arise.</span><a id="a11774"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16527"><span class="t19">{1095}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When you and all these maids I behold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will do virtuous actions manifold.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To him the Nāga king said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">41. &ldquo;Surely &rsquo;tis good to venerate the wise</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In whom deep wisdom and high thoughts arise.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When me and all these maids you do behold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then do you virtuous actions manifold.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.290]</span></p>
<p class="p6">After this speech, Uggasena wished to go, and he took leave, saying: &ldquo;Nāga king, I have stayed long here, and I must go.&rdquo; The Great Being pointed to his treasure, and offered him whatever he wished to take, saying this,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">42. &ldquo;I renounce it, gold untold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tree-high silver-heaps, behold!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Take and make you walls of silver,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Take and houses make of gold. </span><span class="t18">{4.468}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Coral blushing in between,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Take and spread them in your palace</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Till nor earth nor dirt be seen.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">44. Such a mansion as I tell</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Rich will be Benares city:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Rule it wisely, rule it well.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king agreed to this suggestion. Then the Great Being sent proclamation about the city by beat of drum, &ldquo;Let all the attendants of the king take what they will of my wealth, gold and fine gold!&rdquo; And he sent the treasure to the king loaded in several hundred carts. After this the king left the serpent world with great pomp, and returned to Benares. From that time, they say, the ground was all golden throughout Jambudīpa.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This discourse ended, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Thus wise men of old left the glories of the serpent world, to keep the Uposatha precepts.&rdquo; Then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time, Devadatta was the snake-charmer, Rāhula&rsquo;s mother was Sumanā, Sariputta was Uggasena, and I was myself Campeyya king of the Snakes.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is discontent owing to his love of women. The Buddha tells a story of a prince who disliked women so much he was brought up secluded from them. One female singer was hired by the king to entice him, but when he began to kill potential rivals in jealousy, the king exiled him. In the wilderness the woman seduced an ascetic and ended his Super Knowledges.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;From Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm.&rdquo;</span><a id="a11783"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, about the defilement of the purified. The circumstances have already been given. Here again the Teacher said: &ldquo;Women cause defilement even in purified souls,&rdquo; and then told this story of the past.</span><span class="t18"> [4.291] {4.469}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11784"></a><a id="a11785"></a>In the past in Benares &ndash; here the story of the past is to be expanded as in the Cullapalobhanajātaka [Ja 263].</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11786"></a><span class="t11">In the past Brahmadatta, the king of Benares, was childless. He said to his queen, &ldquo;Let us offer prayer for a son.&rdquo; They offered prayer. After a long time, the Bodhisatta came down from the Brahmā Realm, and was conceived by this queen. So soon as he was born, he was bathed, and given to a serving woman to nurse. As he took the breast, he cried. He was given to another; but while a woman held him, he would not be quiet. So he was given to a man servant; and as soon as the man took him, he was quiet. After that men used to carry him about. When they suckled him, they would milk the breast for him, or they gave him the breast from behind a screen. Even when he grew older, they could not show him a woman. The king caused to be made for him a separate place for sitting or what not, and a separate room for meditation, all by himself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">When the lad was sixteen years old, the king thought thus within himself. &ldquo;Other son have I none, and this one enjoys no pleasures. He will not even wish for the kingdom. What&rsquo;s the good of such a son?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11787"></a><a id="a11788"></a>Now once again the Great Being came down from the Brahmā Realm as the king of Kāsi&rsquo;s son, and his name was prince Anitthigandha, the Woman-hater. In the hands of a woman he would not be; they needed to dress as men to give him the breast; he dwelt in a closet of meditation, and never a woman he saw.<a id="a11789"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16529"><span class="t9">{1096}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher repeated four verses.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;From Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm a Devaputta came upon this earth</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As a king&rsquo;s son whose every wish was law, he had his birth.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. To Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm no deed of lust, no mention, ever came:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So born into this world, the prince now loathed its very name.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Within the palace he had made a closet all his own,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where deep in meditation plunged he passed his days alone.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. The king, grown anxious for his son, laments to know him there:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">One only son I have, and he for pleasures will not care.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The fifth verse describes the king&rsquo;s lamentation:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;O who can tell me what to do! O is there no device?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who&rsquo;ll teach him joys of love to crave, and who can him entice?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The next verse and half a verse, are those spoken after Fully Awakening:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;A girl there was, of graceful shape, of fair and lovely skin:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She knew a world of pretty songs, and well could dance and spin.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This maiden sought his majesty, and thus she did begin.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.470}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The other line is spoken by the young girl:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7a. &ldquo;I will entice him, if you will in marriage grant him me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king made answer to the maid, and thus and thus said he;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7b. &ldquo;Do but succeed in tempting him, your husband he shall be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king now gave orders that all opportunity should be afforded her, and sent her to attend upon the prince. In the morning, taking her lute she went and stood just outside the prince&rsquo;s sleeping chamber, and touching the lute with her finger-tips tried to tempt him by singing in a sweet voice.<span class="t18"> [4.292]</span></p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;The maiden went within the house, and where she stood apart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sang ditties sweet and languishing, to pierce a lover&rsquo;s heart.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. There as the maiden stood and sang, the prince, who heard the sound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Straight fell in fancy, and he asked the servants waiting round:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &lsquo;What is that sound of melody that comes to me so clear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Piercing the heart with thoughts of love, delightful to my ear?&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &lsquo;A maid, your majesty, fair to see, of dalliance infinite:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Would you enjoy the sweets of love, yield, yield to this delight.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &lsquo;Ho, hither, nearer let her come, and let her sing yet more,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here let her sing before my face within my closet door!&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. She who had sung without the wall stood in the chamber there:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She caught him, as an elephant is caught in woodland snare.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. He felt the joy of love, and lo! see jealousy full-grown:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;No other man shall love! Cries he, but I will love alone!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. No other man, but I alone!&rsquo; He cries; and then away &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seizes a sword, and runs amuck all other men to slay!</span><span class="t18"> {4.471}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. The people shouting in alarm all to the palace fly:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Your son is slaying every one all unprovoked!&rsquo; they cry.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. Him did the warrior king arrest, and banish from his face:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Within the boundaries of my realm you shall not find a place.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. He took his wife and travelled on till by the sea he stood</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There built a hut of leaves, and lived on gleanings from the wood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. A holy ascetic flying came over the ocean high,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He entered the hut at the time the meal was standing by.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. The woman tempted him: now see how vile a thing was done!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11790"></a><a id="a11791"></a><span class="t12">He fell from chastity, and his Super Powers were gone!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. The evening came; the prince returns, and from his gleaning brings</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hung to his pole a plenteous store of roots and wild-wood things.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. The ascetic sees the prince approach: down to the shore goes he,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thinking to travel through the air, but sinks into the sea!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. But when the prince beheld the sage down-sinking in the sea,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pity sprang up within him, and these verses then said he;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. &lsquo;Hither not sailing on the sea, by Super Powers you came,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. Seducing traitresses, they tempt the holiest to his fall:</span></p>

In the past the king&rsquo;s four wise men, out of jealousy, seek to entrap Mahosadha, the king&rsquo;s wise son with a question about secrecy.

<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Again these four said: &ldquo;This common fellow is waxen greater: what are we to do?&rdquo; Senaka said to them, &ldquo;All right, I know a plan. Let us go to the fellow and ask him, &lsquo;To whom is it right to tell a secret?&rsquo; If he says, &lsquo;To no one,&rsquo; we will speak against him to the king and say that he is a traitor.&rdquo; So the four went to the wise man&rsquo;s house, and greeted him, and said: &ldquo;Wise sir, we want to ask you a question.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ask away,&rdquo; said he. Senaka said: &ldquo;Wise sir, wherein should a man be firmly established?&rdquo; &ldquo;In the truth.&rdquo; &ldquo;That done, what is the next thing to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;He must make wealth.&rdquo; &ldquo;What next after that?&rdquo; &ldquo;He must learn good counsel.&rdquo; &ldquo;After that what next?&rdquo; &ldquo;He must tell no man his own secret.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; they said, and went away happy, thinking: &ldquo;This day we shall see the fellow&rsquo;s back!&rdquo; Then they entered the king&rsquo;s presence and said to him, &ldquo;Sire, the fellow is a traitor to you!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The king replied, &ldquo;I do not believe you, he will never be traitor to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Believe it, sire, for it is true! But if you do not believe, then ask him to whom a secret ought to be told; if he is no traitor, he will say, &lsquo;To so and so;&rsquo; but if he is a traitor he will say, &lsquo;A secret should be told to no one;&rsquo; when your desire is fulfilled, then you may speak. Then believe us, and be suspicious no longer.&rdquo; Accordingly one day when all were seated together he recited the first verse of the Wise Man&rsquo;s Question from Book XV:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">1. &ldquo;The five wise men are now together, and a question occurs to me, listen: to whom should a secret be revealed, whether good or bad?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">This said, Senaka, thinking to bring the king over to their side, repeated this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">2. &ldquo;Do you declare your mind, O lord of the earth! You are our supporter and bear our burdens. The five clever men will understand your wish and pleasure, and will then speak, O master of men!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Then the king in his human infirmity recited this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">3. &ldquo;If a woman be virtuous, and faithful, subservient to her husband&rsquo;s wish and will, affectionate, a secret should be told whether good or bad to the wife.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Now the king is on my side!&rdquo; thought Senaka, and pleased he repeated a verse, explaining his own course of conduct:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">4. &ldquo;He who protects a sick man in distress and who is his refuge and support, may reveal to his friend a secret whether good or bad.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Then the king asked Pukkusa, &ldquo;How does it seem to you, Pukkusa? To whom should a secret be told?&rdquo; and Pukkusa recited this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">5. &ldquo;Old or young or betwixt, if a brother be virtuous and trusty, to such a brother a secret may be told whether good or bad.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Next the king asked Kāvinda, and he recited this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">6. &ldquo;When a son is obedient to his father&rsquo;s heart, a true son, of lofty wisdom, to that son a secret may be revealed whether good or bad.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">And then the king asked Devinda, who recited this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">7. &ldquo;O lord of men! If a mother cherishes her son with loving fondness, to his mother he may reveal a secret whether good or bad.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">After asking them the king asked, &ldquo;How do you look upon it, wise sir?&rdquo; and he recited this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">8. &ldquo;Good is the secrecy of a secret, the revealing of a secret is not to be praised. The clever man should keep it to himself while it is not accomplished; but after it is done he may speak when he will.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">When the sage had said this the king was displeased: then the king looked at Senaka and Senaka looked at the king. This the Bodhisatta saw, and recognized the fact, that these four had once before slandered him to the king, and that this question must have been put to test him. Now while they were talking the sun had set, and lamps had been lit. &ldquo;Hard are the ways of kings,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;what will happen no one can tell; I must depart with speed.&rdquo; So he rose from his seat, and greeted the king, and went away thinking: &ldquo;Of these four, one said it should be told to a friend, one to a brother, one to a son, one to a mother: they must have done or seen something; or I think, they have heard others tell what they have seen. Well, well, I shall find out today.&rdquo; Such was his thought.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now on other days, these four on coming out of the palace used to sit on a trough at the palace door, and talk of their plans before going home: so the sage thought that if he should hide beneath that trough he might learn their secrets. Lifting the trough accordingly, he caused a rug to be spread beneath it and crept in, giving directions to his men to fetch him when the four wise men had gone away after their talk. The men promised and departed. Meanwhile Senaka was saying to the king, &ldquo;Sire, you do not believe us, now what do you think?&rdquo; The king accepted the word of these tale-tellers without investigation, and asked in terror, &ldquo;What are we to do now, wise Senaka?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, without delay, without a word to anyone, he must be killed.&rdquo; &ldquo;O Senaka, no one cares for my interests but you. Take your friends with you and wait at the door, and in the morning when the fellow comes to wait upon me, cleave his head with a sword.&rdquo; So saying he gave them his own precious sword. &ldquo;Very good, my lord, fear nothing, we will kill him.&rdquo; They went out saying: &ldquo;We have seen the back of our enemy!&rdquo; and sat down on the trough.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Then Senaka said: &ldquo;Friends, who shall strike the fellow?&rdquo; The others said: &ldquo;You, our teacher,&rdquo; laying the task on him. Then Senaka said: &ldquo;You said, friends, that a secret ought to be told to such and such a person: was it something you had done, or seen, or heard?&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind that, teacher: when you said that a secret might be told to a friend, was that something which you had done?&rdquo; &ldquo;What does that matter to you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Pray tell us, teacher,&rdquo; they repeated. He said: &ldquo;If the king come to know this secret, my life would be forfeit.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not fear, teacher, there&rsquo;s no one here to betray your secret, tell us, teacher.&rdquo; Then, tapping upon the trough, Senaka said: &ldquo;What if that clodhopper is under this!&rdquo; &ldquo;O teacher! The fellow in all his glory would not creep into such a place as this! He must be intoxicated with his prosperity. Come, tell us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Senaka told his secret and said: &ldquo;Do you know such and such a harlot in this city?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, teacher.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is she now to be seen?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, teacher.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the Sāl-grove I lay with her, and afterwards killed her to get her ornaments, which I tied up in a bundle and took to my house and hung up on an elephant&rsquo;s tusk in such a room of such a storey: but use them I cannot until it has blown over. This crime I have disclosed to a friend, and he has not told a soul; and that is why I said a secret may be told to a friend.&rdquo; The sage heard this secret of Senaka&rsquo;s and bore it in mind.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Then Pukkusa told his secret. &ldquo;On my thigh is a spot of leprosy. In the morning my young brother washes it, puts a salve on it and a bandage, and never tells a soul. When the king&rsquo;s heart is soft he cries, &lsquo;Come here, Pukkusa,&rsquo; and he often lays his head on my thigh. But if he knew he would kill me. No one knows this except my young brother; and that is why I said, &lsquo;A secret may be told to a brother.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Kāvinda told his secret. &ldquo;As for me, in the dark fortnight on the Uposatha a Yakkha named Naradeva takes possession of me, and I bark like a mad dog. I told my son about this; and he, when he sees me to be possessed, fastens me up indoors, and then he leaves me shutting the door, and to hide my noises he gathers a party of people. That is why I said that a secret might be told to a son.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Then they all three asked Devinda, and he told his secret. &ldquo;I am inspector of the king&rsquo;s jewels; and I stole a wonderful lucky gem, the gift of Sakka to king Kusa, and gave it to my mother. When I go to Court she hands it to me, without a word to anyone; and by reason of that gem I am pervaded with the spirit of good fortune when I enter the palace. The king speaks to me first before any of you, and gives me each day to spend eight rupees, or sixteen, or thirty-two, or sixty-four. If the king knew of my having that gem concealed I&rsquo;m a dead man! That is why I said that a secret might be told to a mother.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The Great Being took careful note of all their secrets; but they, after disclosing their secrets as if they had ripped up their bellies and let the entrails out, rose up from the seat and departed, saying: &ldquo;Be sure to come early and we will kill the churl.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">When they were gone the sage&rsquo;s men came and turned up the trough and took the Great Being home. He washed and dressed and ate; and knowing that his sister queen Udumbarī would that day send him a message from the palace, he placed a trusty man on the look-out, bidding him send in at once anyone coming from the palace. Then he lay down on his bed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">At that time the king also was lying upon his bed and remembering the virtue of the sage. &ldquo;The sage Mahosadha has served me since he was seven years old, and never done me wrong. When the Devatā asked me her questions but for the sage I had been a dead man. To accept the words of revengeful enemies, to give them a sword and bid them slay a peerless sage, this I ought never to have done. After tomorrow I shall see him no more!&rdquo; He grieved, sweat poured from his body, possessed with grief his heart had no peace. Queen Udumbarī, who was with him on his couch, seeing him in this frame, asked, &ldquo;Have I done any offence against you? Or has any other thing caused grief to my lord?&rdquo; and she repeated this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">9. &ldquo;Why are you perplexed, O king? We hear not the voice of the lord of men! What do you ponder thus downcast? There is no offence from me, my lord.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Then the king repeated a verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">10. &ldquo;They said, the wise Mahosadha must be slain; and condemned by me to death is the most wise one. As I think on this I am downcast. There is no fault in you, my queen.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">When she heard this, grief crushed her like a rock for the Great Being; and she thought: &ldquo;I know a plan to console the king: when he goes to sleep I will send a message to my brother.&rdquo; Then she said to him, &ldquo;Sire, it is your doing that the churl&rsquo;s son was raised to great power; you made him commander-in-chief. Now they say he has become your enemy. No enemy is insignificant; killed he must be, so do not grieve.&rdquo; Thus she consoled the king; his grief waned and he fell asleep. Then up rose the queen and went to her chamber, and wrote a letter to this effect. &ldquo;Mahosadha, the four wise men have slandered you; the king is angry, and tomorrow has commanded that you be slain in the gate. Do not come to the palace tomorrow morning; or if you do come, come with power to hold the city in your hand.&rdquo; She put the letter within a sweetmeat, and tied it up with a thread, and put it in a new jar, perfumed it, sealed it up, and gave it to a handmaid, saying: &ldquo;Take this sweetmeat and give it to my brother.&rdquo; She did so. You must not wonder how she got out in the night; for the king had previously given this boon to the queen, and therefore no one hindered her. The Bodhisatta received the present and dismissed the woman, who returned and reported that she had delivered it. Then the queen went and lay down by the king. The Bodhisatta opened the sweetmeat, and read the letter, and understood it, and after deliberating what should be done went to rest.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Early in the morning, the other four wise men sword in hand stood by the gate, but not seeing the sage they became downcast, and went in to the king. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the clodhopper killed?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;We have not seen him, sire.&rdquo; And the Great Being at sunrise got the whole city into his power, set guards here and there, and in a chariot with a great host of men and great magnificence came to the palace gates. The king stood looking out of an open window. Then the Great Being got down from his chariot and saluted him; and the king thought: &ldquo;If he were my enemy, he would not salute me.&rdquo; Then the king sent for him, and sat upon his throne.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The Great Being came in and sat on one side: the four wise men also sat down there. Then the king made as if he knew nothing and said: &ldquo;My son, yesterday you left us and now you come again; why do you treat me thus negligently?&rdquo; and he repeated this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">11. &ldquo;At evening you went, now you come. What have you heard? What does your mind fear? Who commanded you, O most wise? Come, we are listening for the word: tell me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The Great Being replied, &ldquo;Sire, you listened to the four wise men and commanded my death, that is why I did not come,&rdquo; and reproaching him repeated this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">12. &ldquo; &lsquo;The wise Mahosadha must be slain:&rsquo; if you told this last night secretly to your wife, your secret was disclosed and I heard it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">When the king heard this he looked angrily at his wife thinking that she must have sent word of it on the instant. Observing this the Great Being said: &ldquo;Why are you angry with the queen, my lord? I know all the past, present, and future. Suppose the queen did tell your secret: who told me the secrets of master Senaka, and Pukkusa, and the rest of them? But I know all their secrets,&rdquo; and he told Senaka&rsquo;s secret in this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">13. &ldquo;The sinful and wicked deed which Senaka did in the Sāl-grove he told to a friend in secret, that secret has been disclosed and I have heard it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Looking at Senaka, the king asked, &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, it is true,&rdquo; he replied, and the king ordered him to be cast into prison. Then the sage told Pukkusa&rsquo;s secret in this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">14. &ldquo;In the man Pukkusa, O king of men, there is a disease unfit for a king&rsquo;s touching: he told it in secret to his brother. That secret has been disclosed and I have heard it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The king looking upon him asked, &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; said he; and the king sent him also to prison. Then the sage told Kāvinda&rsquo;s secret in this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">15. &ldquo;Diseased is that man, of evil nature, possessed of Naradeva. He told it in secret to his son: this secret has been disclosed and I have heard it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Is it true, Kāvinda?&rdquo; the king asked; and he answered, &ldquo;It is true.&rdquo; Then the king sent him also to prison. The sage now told Devinda&rsquo;s secret in this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">16. &ldquo;The noble and precious gem of eight facets, which Sakka gave to your grandfather, that is now in Devinda&rsquo;s hands, and he told it to his mother in secret. That secret has been disclosed and I have heard it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Is it true, Devinda?&rdquo; the king asked; and he answered, &ldquo;It is true.&rdquo; So he sent him also to prison.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11809"></a><span class="t11">Thus they who had plotted to slay the Bodhisatta were all in bonds together. And the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;This is why I say, a man should tell his secret to no one; those who said that a secret ought to be told, have all come to utter ruin.&rdquo; And he recited these verses, proclaiming a higher Dhamma:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">17. &ldquo;The secrecy of a secret is always good, nor is it well to divulge a secret. When a thing is not accomplished the wise man should keep it to himself: when he has accomplished his aim let him speak as he will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">18. One should not disclose a secret thing, but should guard it like a treasure; for a secret thing is not well revealed by the prudent.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">19. Not to a woman would the wise man tell a secret, not to a foe, nor to one who can be enticed by self-interest, nor for affection&rsquo;s sake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">20. He who discloses a secret thing unknown, through fear of broken confidence must endure to be the other&rsquo;s slave.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">21. As many as are those who know a man&rsquo;s secret, so many are his anxieties: therefore one should not disclose a secret.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">22. Go apart to tell a secret by day; by night in a soft whisper: for listeners hear the words, therefore the words soon come out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">When the king heard the Great Being speak he was angry, and he thought: &ldquo;These men, traitors themselves to their king, make out that the wise man is traitor to me!&rdquo; Then he said: &ldquo;Go drive them out of the town, and impale them or cleave their heads!&rdquo; So they bound their hands behind them, at every street corner gave them a hundred blows. But as they were dragged along, the sage said: &ldquo;My lord, these are your ancient ministers, pardon them their fault!&rdquo; The king consented, and gave them to be his slaves. He set them free at once. Then the king said: &ldquo;Well, they shall not live in my dominion,&rdquo; and ordered that they should be banished. But the sage begged him to pardon their blind folly, and appeased him, and persuaded him to restore their positions. The king was much pleased with the sage: if this were his tender mercy towards his foes, what must it be to others! Thenceforward the four wise men, like snakes with their teeth drawn and their poison gone, could not find a word to say, we are told.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;At last we see.&rdquo;</span><a id="a11820"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about the Great Renunciation.</span><a id="a11821"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16537"><span class="t9">{1100}</span></a><span class="t30"> Then with these words, &ldquo;It is not the first time, monks, that the Tathāgata made the Renunciation, but it was so before,&rdquo; the Teacher told them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past there reigned in Benares a king named Esukārī. His family priest had been from the days of his youth his favourite companion. They were both childless. As the two were sitting together one day in a friendly manner, they thought: &ldquo;We have great glory, but never a <span class="t18">[4.294] </span>son or a daughter: now what is to be done?&rdquo; Then the king said to the family priest, &ldquo;Friend, if a son is born in your house, he shall be lord of my kingdom; but if I have a son, he shall be master of your wealth.&rdquo; The two made a bargain of it on these terms.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, as the family priest approached his revenue-village, and entered by the southern gate, outside the gate he saw a wretched woman who had many sons: <span class="t18">{4.474}</span><a id="a11822"></a> seven sons she had, all hale and hearty; one held pot and plate for cooking, one mat and bedding, one went on before and one followed behind, one held her finger, one sat on her hip and one on her shoulder. &ldquo;Where,&rdquo; asked the family priest, &ldquo;is the father of these lads?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;the lads have no father at all for certain.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; said he,&rdquo; how did you get seven fine sons like that?&rdquo;<a id="a11823"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16540"><span class="t9">{1101}</span></a><a id="a11824"></a> Disregarding the rest of the jungle, she points out a banyan tree that stood by the city gate, and said she, &ldquo;I offered prayer, sir, to the Devatā which inhabits this tree, and he answered me by giving these lads.&rdquo; &ldquo;You may go, then,&rdquo; said the family priest; and descending from his chariot, he went up to the tree and taking hold of a branch shook it, saying: &ldquo;O Devaputta, what has the king failed to give you? Year by year he offers you tribute of a thousand pieces of money, and you give him no son. What has this beggar wife done for you, that you give her seven? You shall grant the king a son within seven days, or I will have you cut down by the roots and chopped up piecemeal.&rdquo; Thus upbraiding the Devatā of the banyan tree, he went away. Day after day for six days he did the same, and on the sixth, grasping the branch he said: &ldquo;Only one night is left, Tree Devatā; if you do not grant a son to my king, down you come!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11825"></a>The Tree Devatā reflected, till she knew exactly what was the matter. &ldquo;That brahmin,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;will destroy my home if he gets no son: well, by what means can I get him a son?&rdquo; Then she went before the Four Great Kings,<a id="a11826"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16542"><span class="t9">{1102}</span></a> and told them. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we cannot give the man a son.&rdquo; To the eight-and-twenty war-lords of the Yakkhas she went next, and all they said was the same. To Sakka, King of the Devas, she came, and told him. He pondered within himself, &ldquo;Shall the king get sons worthy of him, or no?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.475}</span> Then he looked about and saw four meritorious Devaputtas. These, it is said, had been in a former existence weavers of Benares; and all their winnings by that trade they would divide into five heaps; of these four were their own shares, but the fifth they gave away in common. When born anew from that place they came to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, thence <span class="t18">[4.295] </span><a id="a11827"></a>again they were born into the Yāma world,<a id="a11828"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16544"><span class="t9">{1103}</span></a> thence in due succession they passed up and down through the six celestial worlds and enjoyed much glory. Just then the time was when they were due to go from the Heaven of the Thirty-Three to the Yāma Heaven. Sakka went to seek them, and summoned them, and said: &ldquo;Venerable sirs, you must go to the world of men, to be conceived in the womb of king Esukārī&rsquo;s chief consort.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good, my lord,&rdquo; said they to these words, &ldquo;we will go. But we do not want anything to do with a royal house: we will be born in the family priest&rsquo;s family, and while yet young we will renounce the world.&rdquo; Then Sakka approved them for their promise, and returned, and told all to the Devatā that lived in the tree. Much pleased, the Tree Devatā took leave of Sakka, and went to her dwelling place.</p>
<p class="p7">But next day up came the family priest, and with him strong men whom he had gathered, having each a razor-adze or the like. The family priest approached the tree, and seizing a branch, cried out, &ldquo;What ho, Devatā of the tree! This is now the seventh day since I begged a favour of you: the time of your destruction is come!&rdquo; The Tree Devatā by her great power cleft the tree-trunk and came forth, and in a sweet voice addressed him thus, &ldquo;One son, brahmin? Pooh! I will give you four.&rdquo; Said he, &ldquo;I want no sons; give one to my king.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;I will give only to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then give two to the king and two to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, the king shall have none, you shall have all four; but they shall be only given to you, for they will not live in a worldly household: in the days of their youth they will renounce the world.&rdquo; &ldquo;Just give me the sons, and I will see to it they do not renounce the world,&rdquo; said he. Thus the Devatā granted his prayer for children, and returned to her dwelling place. Ever afterwards that Devatā was held in high honour.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11829"></a>Now the eldest Devaputta came down, <span class="t18">{4.476}</span> and was conceived by the brahmin&rsquo;s wife. On his name day they called him Hatthipāla, the elephant Driver; and to hinder him from renouncing the world, they entrusted him to the care of some keepers of elephants, amongst whom he grew up. When he was old enough to walk on his feet, the second was born of the same woman. At his birth they named him Assapāla, or Groom, and he grew up amongst those who kept horses. The third at his birth was called Gopāla, the Cowherd, and he grew up amongst the cattle-breeders. Ajapāla, or Goatherd, was the name given to the fourth, when he also was born; and he grew up among the goatherds. When they grew older they were lads of auspicious omen.</p>
<p class="p7">Now for fear of their renouncing the world, all the ascetics who had done so were banished from the kingdom: in the whole realm of Kāsi not one was left. The lads were rough: in whatsoever way they <span class="t18">[4.296] </span>went, they plundered those gifts of ceremony which were sent here or there.</p>
<p class="p7">When Hatthipāla was sixteen years old, the king and the family priest seeing his bodily perfection, thought thus within them. &ldquo;The lads are grown big. When the umbrella of royalty is uplifted, what shall be done with them? As soon as the ceremony of sprinkling is done upon them, they will grow very masterful: ascetics will come, they will see them and will become ascetics also; once they have done this, the whole country will be in confusion. First let us test them, and afterwards have the ceremonial sprinkling.&rdquo; So they both dressed themselves up like ascetics, and went about seeking alms until they came to the door of the house where Hatthipāla lived. The lad was pleased and delighted to see them; approaching, he greeted them with respect, and recited three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;At last we see a brahmin like a god, with top-knot great,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11830"></a><span class="t12">With teeth uncleansed, and foul with dust, and burdened with a weight.</span><a id="a11831"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16546"><span class="t19">{1104}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. At last we see a sage, who takes delight in righteousness,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With robes of bark to cover him, and with the yellow dress.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Accept a seat, and for your feet fresh water; it is right</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To offer gifts of food to guests &ndash; accept, as we invite.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.477}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus he addressed them one after the other. Then the family priest said to him, &ldquo;Hatthipāla my son, you say this because you do not know us. You think we are sages from the Himālayas, but such we are not, my son. This is king Esukārī, and I am your father the family priest.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the lad, &ldquo;why are you dressed like sages?&rdquo; &ldquo;To try you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why try me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Because, if you see us without renouncing the world, we are ready to perform the ceremony of sprinkling, and make you king.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, my father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I want no royalty; I will renounce the world.&rdquo; Then his father replied, &ldquo;Son Hatthipāla, this is not a time for renouncing the world,&rdquo; and he explained his intent in the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;First learn the Vedas, get you wealth and wife</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And sons, enjoy the pleasant things of life,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Smell, taste, and every sense: sweet is the wood</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To live in then, and then the sage is good.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hatthipāla replied with a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Truth comes not by the Vedas nor by gold;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor getting sons will keep from getting old; </span><span class="t18">{4.478}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From sense there is release, as wise men know;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In the next birth we reap as now we sow.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.297]</span></p>
<p class="p6">In answer to the young man, the king now recited a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Most true the words that from your lips do go:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In the next birth we reap as now we sow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your parents now are old: but may they see</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A hundred years of health in store for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;What do you mean, my lord?&rdquo; asked the prince, and repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;He who in death, O king, a friend can find,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And with old age a covenant hath signed;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For him that will not die be this your prayer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A hundred years of life to be his share.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. As one who on a river ferries o&rsquo;er</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A boat, and journeys to the other shore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So mortals do inevitably tend</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To sickness and old age, and death&rsquo;s the end.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.479}</span></p>
<p class="p6">In this manner he showed these persons how transient are the conditions of mortal life, adding this advice, &ldquo;As you stand there, O great king, and as I speak with you, even now sickness, old age, and death are drawing nearer to me. Then be vigilant!&rdquo; So saluting the king and his father, he took with him his own attendants, and forsook the kingdom of Benares, and departed with the intent to embrace the ascetic life. And a great company of people went with the young man Hatthipāla, &ldquo;For,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;this ascetic life must be a noble thing.&rdquo; The company extended a league long. He with this company proceeded until he came to the Ganges bank. There by the waters of the Ganges he induced Absorption by focusing on the water Meditation Object. &ldquo;There will be a great concourse here,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;My three younger brothers will come, my parents, king, queen, and all, they with their attendants will embrace the ascetic life. Benares will be empty. Until they come I will remain here.&rdquo; So he sat there, exhorting the crowd assembled.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day the king and his family priest thought: &ldquo;And so prince Hatthipāla has really renounced his claim on the kingdom, and is sitting on the Ganges bank, whither he went to follow the ascetic life, and took a great multitude with him. But let us try Assapāla, and sprinkle him to be king.&rdquo; So as before in the dress of ascetics they went to his door. Pleased he was when he saw them, and went up to them, and repeating the lines, &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; and so forth, he did as the other had done. The others did as before, and told him the cause of their coming. He said: &ldquo;Why is the white umbrella offered first to me, seeing I have a brother prince Hatthipāla?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Your brother has gone away, my son, to embrace the ascetic life; he would have nothing to do with royalty.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.480}</span> asked the lad. &ldquo;Sitting on the bank of the Ganges.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear ones,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I care not for that which my brother has spewed out of his mouth. Fools and they who are <span class="t18">[4.298] </span>scant of wisdom cannot renounce this wrongdoing, but I will renounce it.&rdquo; Then he declared the Dhamma to father and king in two verses which he recited:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11832"></a><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;Pleasures of sense are but morass and mire;</span><a id="a11833"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16548"><span class="t19">{1105}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The heart&rsquo;s delight brings death, and troubles sore.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who sink in these morasses come no nigher</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11834"></a><span class="t12">In witless madness to the further shore.</span><a id="a11835"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16550"><span class="t19">{1106}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Here&rsquo;s one who once inflicted grief and pain:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now he is caught, and no release is found.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That he may never do such things again</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ll build impenetrable walls around.</span></p>
<p class="p6">There you stand, and even as I speak with you, sickness, old age, and death are approaching nearer.&rdquo; With this admonition, <span class="t18">{4.481}</span> and followed by a company of people a league long, he went to his brother prince Hatthipāla. Who declared the Dhamma to him, being poised in the air, and said: &ldquo;Brother, there will be a great concourse to this place; let us both stay here together.&rdquo; The other agreed to stay there.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day king and family priest went in the same manner to the house of prince Gopāla: and by him being greeted with the same gladness, they explained the cause of their coming. He like Assapāla refused their offer. &ldquo;For a long time,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have desired to embrace the ascetic life; like a cow gone astray in the forest, I have been wandering about in search of this life. I have seen the path by which my brothers have gone, like the track of a lost cow; and by that same path I will go.&rdquo; Then he repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;Like one who seeks a cow has lost her way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who all perplexed about the wood does stray.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So is my welfare lost; then why hang back,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">King Esukārī, to pursue the track?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;come with us for a day, son Gopālaka, for two or three days come with us; make us happy and then you shall renounce the world.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;O great king! Never put off till the morrow what ought to be done today; if you want luck, take today by the forelock.&rdquo; Then he recited another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;Tomorrow! Cries the fool; Next day! He cries.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No freehold in the future! Says the wise;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The good within his reach he&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er despise.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.482}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus spake Gopāla, declaring the Dhamma in the two verses; and added, &ldquo;There you stand, and even as I talk with you, are approaching disease, old age, and death.&rdquo; Then followed by a company of people a league in length, he made his way to his two brothers. And Hatthipāla poised in the air declared the Dhamma to him also. <span class="t18">[4.299]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Next day in the same manner king and family priest repaired to the house of prince Ajapāla, who greeted them with joy as the others had done. They told the cause of their coming, and proposed to upraise the umbrella of royalty. The prince said: &ldquo;Where are my brothers?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Your brothers will have nothing to do with the kingdom; they have renounced the white umbrella, and with a company that covers three leagues they are sitting upon the Ganges bank.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will not put upon my head that which my brothers have spewed out of their mouths, and so live; but I too will undertake the ascetic life.&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;My son, you are very young; your welfare is our care; grow older, and you shall embrace the ascetic life.&rdquo; But the lad said: &ldquo;What is this you say? Surely death comes in youth as in age! No one has a mark in hand or foot to show whether he will die young or die old. I know not the time of my death, and therefore I will now renounce the world altogether.&rdquo; He then recited two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;Oft have I seen a maiden young and fair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11836"></a><span class="t12">Bright-eyed,</span><a id="a11837"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16552"><span class="t19">{1107}</span></a><span class="t12"> intoxicate with life, her share</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of joy untasted yet, in youth&rsquo;s first spring:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Death came and carried off the tender thing.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. So noble, handsome lads, well-made and young,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11838"></a><span class="t12">Round whose dark chins the beard</span><a id="a11839"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16554"><span class="t19">{1108}</span></a><span class="t12"> in clusters clung &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I leave the world and all its sensual desires, to be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">An ascetic: go you home, and pardon me.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.483}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then he went on, &ldquo;There you stand, and even as I talk with you disease, old age, and death are approaching me.&rdquo; He saluted them both, and at the head of a league-long company he repaired to the Ganges bank. Hatthipāla poised in the air declared the Dhamma to him also, and sat down to wait for the great gathering which he expected.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day the family priest began to meditate as he sat upon his couch. &ldquo;My sons,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;have embraced the ascetic life; and now I am alone, a withered stump of a man. I will follow the ascetic life also.&rdquo; Then he addressed this verse to his wife:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;That which has branching boughs a tree they call:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Disbranched, it is a trunk, no tree at all.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So is a sonless man, my high-born wife:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis time for me to embrace the holy life.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">This said, he summoned the brahmins before him: sixty thousand of them came. Then he asked them what they meant to do. <span class="t18">{4.484}</span> &ldquo;You are our teacher,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall seek out my son and embrace the ascetic life.&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Hell is not hot for you alone; we will do likewise.&rdquo; He handed over his treasure, eighty crores, <span class="t18">[4.300] </span>to his wife, and at the head of a league-long train of brahmins departed to the place where his sons were. And unto this company as before Hatthipāla declared the Dhamma, poised on high in the air.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11840"></a>Next day thought the wife to herself, &ldquo;My four sons have refused the white umbrella to follow the life of the ascetics; my husband has left his fortune of eighty thousand, and his position of royal family priest to boot, and gone to join his sons: what am I to do all by myself? By the way my son has gone I will go also.&rdquo; And quoting an ancient she recited this exalted utterance in verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;The rain-months past, the geese break net and snare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11841"></a><span class="t12">With a free flight like herons through the air;</span><a id="a11842"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16556"><span class="t19">{1109}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So by the path of husband and of son</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ll seek for knowledge as they two have done.</span></p>
<p class="p6">Since this I knew,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;why should I not renounce the world?&rdquo; With this purpose she summoned the brahmin women, and said to them: <span class="t18">{4.485}</span> &ldquo;What do you mean to do with yourselves?&rdquo; They asked, &ldquo;What do you?&rdquo; &ldquo;As for me, I shall renounce the world.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then we will do the same.&rdquo; So leaving all her splendour, she went after her sons, taking with her a league-long company of women. To this company also Hatthipāla declared the Dhamma, sitting poised in the air.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day the king asked, &ldquo;Where is my family priest?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;the family priest and his wife have left all their wealth behind, and have gone after their sons with a company that covers two or three leagues.&rdquo; Said the king, &ldquo;Masterless money comes to me,&rdquo; and sent to fetch it from the family priest&rsquo;s house. The chief queen now wanted to know what the king was doing. He is fetching the treasure,&rdquo; she was told, &ldquo;from the family priest&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; &ldquo;And where is the family priest?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Gone to be an ascetic, wife and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;here is the king fetching into his own house the dung and the spittle dropped by this brahmin and his wife and his four sons! Infatuate fool! I will teach him by a parable.&rdquo; She got some dog-flesh, and made a heap of it in the palace courtyard. Then she set a snare round it, leaving the way open straight upwards. The vultures seeing it from afar swooped down. But the wise among them noticed that a snare had been set around it; and feeling they were too heavy to rise up straight, they disgorged what they had eaten, and without being caught in the snare rose up and flew away. Others blind with folly devoured the vomit of the first, and being heavy could not get clear away but were caught in the snare. They brought <span class="t18">[4.301] </span>one of the vultures to the queen, and she carried it to the king. &ldquo;See, O king!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;there is a sight for us in the courtyard.&rdquo; Then opening a window, &ldquo;Look at those vultures, your majesty!&rdquo; Then she repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;The birds that ate and vomited in the air are flying free:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But those which ate and kept it down are captured now by me. </span><span class="t18">{4.486}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. A brahmin vomits out his sensual desires, and will you eat the same</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A man who eats a vomit, sire, deserves the deepest blame.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11843"></a>At these words the king repented; the three states of existence<a id="a11844"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16558"><span class="t9">{1110}</span></a> seemed as blazing fires; and he said: &ldquo;This very day I must leave my kingdom and embrace the ascetic life.&rdquo; Full of grief, he lauded his queen in a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. &ldquo;Like as a strong man lends a helping hand</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To weaker, sunk in mire or in quicksand:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So, queen Pañcātī, you have saved me here,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With verses sung so sweetly in mine ear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">No sooner had he thus said, than on the instant he sent for his courtiers, eager to undertake the ascetic life, and said to them, &ldquo;And what will you do?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;What will you?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I will seek Hatthipāla and become an ascetic.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we, my lord, will do the same.&rdquo; The king left his sovereignty over Benares, that great city, twelve leagues in extent, and said: &ldquo;Let who will upraise the white umbrella.&rdquo; Then surrounded by his courtiers, at the head of a column three leagues in length, he went to the presence of the young man. To this body also Hatthipāla declared the Dhamma, sitting high in the air.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher repeated a verse which told how the king renounced this world.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. &ldquo;Thus Esukārī, mighty king, the lord of many lands,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From king turned ascetic, like an elephant that bursts his bands.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.487}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Next day the people who were left in the city gathered before the palace door, and sent in word to the queen. They entered, and saluting the queen, stood on one side, repeating a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. &ldquo;It is the pleasure of our noble king</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To be an ascetic, leaving everything.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So in the king&rsquo;s place now we pray you stand;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cherish the realm, protected by our hand.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.302]</span></p>
<p class="p6">She listened to what the crowd said, and then repeated the remaining verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;It is the pleasure of the noble king</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To be an ascetic, leaving everything.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now know that I will walk the world alone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Renouncing sensual desires and pleasures every one.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. It is the pleasure of the noble king</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To be an ascetic, leaving everything.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now know that I will walk the world alone,</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a11847"></a>In these verses she declared the Dhamma to the great crowd; then summoning the courtier&rsquo;s wives said to them, &ldquo;And what will you do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; say they, &ldquo;what will you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will embrace the ascetic life.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then so will we do.&rdquo; So the queen set open the doors of all the storehouses of gold in the palace, and she caused to be engraved on a golden plate, &ldquo;In such a place is a great treasure hidden,&rdquo; any one who chose might have it. This gold plate she fastened to a pillar upon the great dais, and sent the drum beating the proclamation about the city. Then leaving all her magnificence she departed from the city. Then was the whole city in confusion: the cry was, &ldquo;Our king and queen have left the city to join the ascetics; what are we to do now?&rdquo; Thereupon the people all left their houses, and all that was in them, and went out, taking their sons by the hand; all the shops stood open, but no one so much as turned to look at them: the whole city was empty.</p>
<p class="p7">And the queen with an attendant train of three leagues in length went to the same place as the others. To this company also Hatthipāla declared the Dhamma, poised in the air above them; and then with the whole train a dozen leagues long he set out for the Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">All Kāsi was in an uproar, crying how young Hatthipāla had emptied the city of Benares, twelve leagues in extent, and how with a huge company he is off to the Himālayas to embrace the ascetic life, &ldquo;Surely then,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;much more should we do it!&rdquo; In the end this company grew so that it covered thirty leagues; <span class="t18">{4.489}</span> and he with this great company went to the Himālayas. <span class="t18">[4.303]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11848"></a><a id="a11849"></a><a id="a11850"></a>Sakka in his meditation perceived what was afoot. &ldquo;Prince Hatthipāla,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;has made the Renunciation; there will be a great gathering of people, and they must have a place to live in.&rdquo; He gave orders to Vissakamma, &ldquo;Go, make a hermitage six and thirty leagues long and fifteen broad, and gather in it all that is necessary for an ascetic.&rdquo; He obeyed; and made on the Ganges bank in a pleasant spot a hermitage of the required size, prepared in the leaf-huts pallets strewn with twigs or strewn with leaves, made ready all things necessary for an ascetic. Each hut had its doors, each its promenade; there were separate places for night and day living; all was neatly worked over with whitewash; there were benches for rest. Here and there were flowering trees all laden with fragrant blooms of many colours; at the end of each promenade was a well for drawing water, and beside it a fruit tree, and each tree bore all manner of fruits. This was all done by divine power. When Vissakamma had finished the hermitage, and provided the leaf huts with all things needful, he inscribed in letters of vermilion upon a wall, &ldquo;Whoso will embrace the ascetic life is welcome to these necessary things.&rdquo; Then by his supernatural power he banished from that place all hideous sounds, all hateful beasts and birds, all Amanussas, and went back to his own place.</p>
<p class="p7">Hatthipāla came upon this hermitage, Sakka&rsquo;s gift, by a footpath, and saw the writing. Then he thought: &ldquo;Sakka must have perceived that I have made the Great Renunciation.&rdquo; He opened a door, and entered a hut, and taking those things which mark the ascetic he went out again, and along the promenade, walking up and down a few times. Then he admitted the rest of the company to the ascetic life, and went to inspect the hermitage. He set apart in the midst a habitation for women with young boys, one next it for the old women, the next for childless women; the other huts all round he allotted to men.<span class="t18"> {4.490}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11851"></a>Then a certain king, hearing that there was no king in Benares, went to see, and found the city adorned and decorated. Entering the royal palace, he saw the treasure lying in a heap. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to renounce a city like this, and to become an ascetic so soon as the chance came, this is truly a noble thing!&rdquo; Asking the way of some drunken fellow he went to find Hatthipāla. When Hatthipāla perceived he was come to the skirt of the forest, he went out to meet him, and poised in the air declared the Dhamma to his company. Then he led them to the hermitage, and received the whole band into the Saṅgha. In the same manner six other kings joined them. These seven kings renounced their wealth. The hermitage, six and thirty leagues in extent, was filling continually. When some great man had thoughts of lust or any such thing, he would declare the Dhamma to him, and teach them the thought of the Divine Abidings and how to focus on the Meditation Object; these then generally developed <span class="t18">[4.304] </span><a id="a11852"></a>the Absorptions; and two-thirds of them were born again in the Brahmā Realm, while the third being divided into three parts, one part was born in the Brahmā Realm, one in the six heavens of sense, one having performed a seer&rsquo;s mission was born in the world of men. Thus they enjoyed each of the three their own merit.<a id="a11853"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16562"><span class="t9">{1112}</span></a> Thus Hatthipāla&rsquo;s teaching saved all from hell, from animal birth, from the world of ghosts, and from being embodied as an Asura.</p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a11865"></a><span class="t30">When he had ended this discourse, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Thus, monks, the Tathāgata made the Great Renunciation long ago, as now,&rdquo; which said he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time, king Suddhodana was king Esukārī, Mahāmāyā his queen, Kassapa the family priest, Bhaddakāpilānī his wife, Anuruddha was Ajapāla, Moggallāna was Gopāla, Sāriputta was Hatthipāla, the Buddha&rsquo;s followers were the rest, and I myself was Hatthipāla.&rdquo;</span></p>
