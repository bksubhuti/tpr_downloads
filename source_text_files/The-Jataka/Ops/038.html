<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;All around us see them stand.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.53]</span><span class="t30"> This is a story told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the Perfection of Wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3702"></a><span class="t34">One day the monks sat in the Dhamma Hall and described the Tathāgata&rsquo;s Perfection of Wisdom, &ldquo;Monks, the Tathāgata is greatly wise, his wisdom is vast, ready, swift, sharp, crushing heretical doctrines, after having converted, by the power of his own knowledge, the brahmins Kūṭadanta and the rest, the ascetics Sabhiya and the rest, the thieves Aṅgulimāla and the rest, the Yakkhas Āḷavaka and the rest, the Devas Sakka and the rest, and the Brahmās Baka and the rest, made them humble, and ordained a vast multitude as ascetics and established them in the fruition of the paths of sanctification.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3703"></a><a id="a3704"></a><span class="t30">As in the Mahābodhijātaka [Ja 528], and the Ummaggajātaka [Ja 538],</span><a id="a3705"></a><a href="notes.html#a15056"><span class="t9">{398}</span></a><a id="a3706"></a><span class="t30"> on hearing his own knowledge praised, he remarked, &ldquo;Not only is the Tathāgata wise this one time, but he was wise before, and had skill in means,&rdquo; and he told the following story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3707"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as a monkey, and with a troop of eighty thousand monkeys he lived in the Himālayas. Not far off was a village, sometimes inhabited and sometimes empty. And in the midst of this village was an ebony<a id="a3708"></a><a href="notes.html#a15059"><span class="t9">{399}</span></a> tree, with sweet fruit, covered with twigs and branches. When the place was empty, all the monkeys used to go there and eat the fruit.</p>
<p class="p7">Once, in the fruiting time, the village was full of people, a bamboo palisade set about it, and the gates guarded. And this tree <span class="t18">{2.77}</span> stood with all its boughs bending beneath the weight of the fruit. The monkeys began to wonder, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s such and such a village, where we used to get fruit to eat. I wonder has that tree fruit upon it or no; are the people there or no?&rdquo; At last they sent a scout to spy. He found that there was fruit on the tree, and the village was crammed with people. When the monkeys heard that there was fruit on the tree, they determined to get that sweet fruit to eat; and waxing bold, a crowd of them went and told their chief. The chief asked was the village full or empty; full, they said. &ldquo;Then you must not go,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;because men are very deceitful.&rdquo; &ldquo;But, sire, we&rsquo;ll go at midnight, when everybody is fast asleep, and then eat!&rdquo; So this great company obtained leave of their chief, and came down from the mountains, and waited on a great rock nearby until the people retired to rest; in the middle watch, when people were asleep, they climbed the tree and began eating of the fruit.</p>
<p class="p7">A man had to get up in the night for some necessary purpose; he went out into the village, and there he saw the monkeys. At once he gave the alarm; out the people came, armed with bow and quiver, or holding any <span class="t18">[2.54] </span>sort of weapon that came to hand, sticks, or lumps of earth, and surrounded the tree, &ldquo;When dawn comes,&rdquo; thought they, &ldquo;we have them!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The eighty thousand monkeys saw these people, and were scared to death. Thought they, &ldquo;We have no help but from our chief only,&rdquo; so to him they came, and recited the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3709"></a><a id="a3710"></a><a id="a3711"></a><a id="a3712"></a><a id="a3713"></a><a id="a3714"></a><a id="a3715"></a><span class="t12">1. Dhanuhatthakalāpehi, nettiṁsavaradhāribhi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3716"></a><a id="a3717"></a><span class="t12">Samantā parikiṇṇamha, kathaṁ mokkho bhavissatī ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a3718"></a><a id="a3719"></a><a id="a3720"></a><a id="a3721"></a><a id="a3722"></a><a id="a3723"></a><a id="a3724"></a><span class="t4">They stand there with quivers in hand, and bows, and bearing noble blades, we are surrounded on all sides, how will there be freedom for us? </span><span class="t18">{2.78}</span></p>
<p class="p23">At this the monkey chief answered, &ldquo;Fear not; human beings have plenty to do. It is the middle watch now; there they stand, thinking &ndash; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll kill them!&rsquo; but we will find some other business to hinder this business of theirs.&rdquo; And to console the monkeys he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3725"></a><a id="a3726"></a><a id="a3727"></a><a id="a3728"></a><a id="a3729"></a><a id="a3730"></a><span class="t12">2. Appeva bahukiccānaṁ, attho jāyetha koci naṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3731"></a><a id="a3732"></a><span class="t12">Atthi rukkhassa acchinnaṁ, khajjathañ-ñeva tindukan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a3733"></a><a id="a3734"></a><a id="a3735"></a><a id="a3736"></a><span class="t4">Perhaps, to those with many duties, some benefit may arise, there is some not cut off the tree, eat the fruit of the ebony.</span></p>
<p class="p23">The Great Being comforted the monkey troop. If they had not had this crumb of comfort their hearts would have broken and they would have perished. When the Great Being had consoled the monkeys, he cried, &ldquo;Assemble all the monkeys together!&rdquo; But in assembling them, there was one they could not find, his nephew, a monkey named Senaka. So they told him that Senaka was not among the troop. &ldquo;If Senaka is not here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have no fear; he will find a way to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Now at the time when the troop sallied forth, Senaka had been asleep. Later he awoke, and could not see any body about. So he followed their tracks, and by and by he saw all the people hastening up. &ldquo;Some danger for our troop,&rdquo; thought he. Just then he spied, in a hut on the outskirts of the village, an old woman, fast asleep, before a lighted fire. And making as though he were a village child going out to the fields, Senaka seized a firebrand, <span class="t18">{2.79}</span> and standing well to windward, set light to the village. Then did every man leave the monkeys, and hurried up to quench the fire. So the monkeys scampered away, and each brought one fruit for Senaka.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse came to an end, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Mahānāma Sakka was the nephew Senaka of those days; the Buddha&rsquo;s followers were the monkey troop; and I myself was their chief.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one young man saves himself by escaping from his disease-ridden home, while all his family dies. The Buddha tells a story of how a turtle who was too attached to his home met with a disastrous end.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the potter (kumbhakāra),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Ānanda = the turtle (kacchapa).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Here was I born.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.55]</span><a id="a3743"></a><a id="a3744"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, how a man got rid of the plague.</span><a id="a3745"></a><a href="notes.html#a15061"><span class="t9">{400}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3746"></a><span class="t30">It is said that the plague once broke out in a family of Sāvatthi. The parents said to their son, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay in this house, son; make a hole in the wall and escape somewhere, and save your life.</span><a id="a3747"></a><a href="notes.html#a15065"><span class="t9">{401}</span></a><a id="a3748"></a><span class="t30"> Then come back again &ndash; in this place a great hoard is buried; dig it up, and restore the family fortunes, and a happy life to you!&rdquo; The young fellow did as he was bid; he broke through the wall, and made his escape. When his complaint was cured, he returned and dug the treasure up, with which he set up his household.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day, laden with oil and ghee, clothes and raiment, and other offerings, he repaired to Jetavana, and greeted the Teacher, and took his seat. The Teacher entered into converse with him. &ldquo;We hear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you had the plague in your house. How did you escape it?&rdquo; He told the Teacher all about it. Said he, &ldquo;In days of yore, as now, friend layman, when danger arose, there were people who were too fond of home to leave it, and they perished thereby; while those who were not too fond of it, but departed elsewhere, saved themselves alive.&rdquo; And then at his request the Teacher told a story about the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a village as a potter&rsquo;s son. He plied the potter&rsquo;s trade, and had a wife and family to support.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time there lay a great natural lake close by the great river of Benares. When there was much water, river and lake were one; but when the water was low, <span class="t18">{2.80}</span> they were apart. Now fish and turtles know by instinct when the year will be rainy and when there will be a drought. So at the time of our story the fish and turtles which lived in that lake knew there would be a drought; and when the two were one water, they swam out of the lake into the river. But there was one turtle that would not go into the river, because, said he, &ldquo;Here I was born, and here I have grown up, and here is my parents&rsquo; home, leave it I cannot!&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.56]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Then in the hot season the water all dried up. He dug a hole and buried himself in the place where the Bodhisatta used to come for clay. There the Bodhisatta came to get some clay; with a big spade he dug down, till he cracked the turtle&rsquo;s shell, turning him out on the ground as though he were a large piece of clay. In his agony the creature thought: &ldquo;Here I am, dying, all because I was too fond of my home to leave it!&rdquo; and in the words of these verses following he moaned:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3749"></a><a id="a3750"></a><a id="a3751"></a><a id="a3752"></a><span class="t12">1. Janittaṁ me bhavittaṁ me, iti paṅke avassayiṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3753"></a><a id="a3754"></a><span class="t12">Taṁ maṁ paṅko ajjhabhavi, yathā dubbalakaṁ tathā.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Taṁ taṁ vadāmi, Bhaggava, suṇohi vacanaṁ mama:</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a3755"></a><a id="a3756"></a><a id="a3757"></a><a id="a3758"></a><a id="a3759"></a><span class="t4">The place of my birth, where I developed, I lived thus on this mud, And on this mud I will now die, just like one of those who is weak. This, just this, I say, O Bhaggava, do you listen to my word:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Gāme vā yadi vāraññe, sukhaṁ yatrādhigacchati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Taṁ janittaṁ bhavittañ-ca purisassa pajānato</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yamhi jīve tamhi gacche, na niketahato siyā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a3760"></a><a id="a3761"></a><a id="a3762"></a><a id="a3763"></a><a id="a3764"></a><a id="a3765"></a><span class="t4">Whether in the village or wilds, wherever he finds happiness, although knowing his place of birth and development, a person should live where&rsquo;er he can go, not staying when his home is destroyed. </span><span class="t18">{2.81}</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a3766"></a>So he went on and on, talking to the Bodhisatta, till he died. The Bodhisatta picked him up, and collecting all the villagers addressed them thus, &ldquo;Look at this turtle. When the other fish and turtles went into the great river, he was too fond of home to go with them, and buried himself in the place where I get my clay. Then as I was digging for clay, I broke his shell with my big spade, and turned him out on the ground in the belief that he was a large lump of clay. Then he called to mind what he had done, lamented his fate in two verses, and expired. So you see he came to his end because he was too fond of his home. Take care not to be like this turtle. Don&rsquo;t say to yourselves, &lsquo;I have sight, I have hearing, I have smell, I have taste, I have touch, I have a son, I have a daughter, I have numbers of men and maids for my service, I have precious gold;&rsquo; do not cleave to these things with craving and desire. Each being passes through three planes of existence.&rdquo;<a id="a3767"></a><a href="notes.html#a15067"><span class="t9">{402}</span></a> Thus did he exhort the crowd with all a Buddha&rsquo;s skill. The discourse was noised abroad all over Jambudīpa, and for full seven thousand years it was remembered. All the crowd abode by his exhortation; and gave alms and did good until at last they went to swell the hosts of heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had made an end, he declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the young man was established in the Fruit of the First Path. He ended by saying: &ldquo;Ānanda was then the turtle, and the Potter was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h3 class="h30"><a id="ncx7055"></a><a id="a3768"></a><a id="a3769"></a><a id="a3770"></a><a id="a3771"></a><a id="a3772"></a>Ja 179 Satadhammajātaka<br/>The Story about (the Proud Brahmin) Satadhamma (2s)</h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present many monks are found to be earning their living in a wrong way, throwing away their chance of true gains in the dispensation. The Buddha tells a story of a brahmin who took food from the Bodhisatta, who was an outcaste at the time, and could never forgive himself for it.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the son of the outcaste (caṇḍālaputta),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Ānanda = the young brahmin (māṇava).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a3773"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Right livelihood, Suitability, Devas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;What a trifle.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.57]</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{2.82}</span><a id="a3774"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while sojourning in Jetavana, about the twenty-one unlawful ways of earning a livelihood.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3775"></a><span class="t30">At one time there were a great many monks who used to get a living by being physicians, or runners, doing errands on foot, exchanging alms for alms,</span><a id="a3776"></a><a href="notes.html#a15069"><span class="t9">{403}</span></a><a id="a3777"></a><span class="t30"> and the like, the twenty-one unlawful callings. All this will be set forth in the Sāketajātaka [Ja 237].</span><a id="a3778"></a><a href="notes.html#a15071"><span class="t9">{404}</span></a><span class="t30"> When the Teacher found out that they got their living thus, he said: &ldquo;Now there are a great many monks who get their living in unlawful ways. Those who get their living thus will not escape birth as Yakkhas or Petas; they will become beasts of burden; they will be born in hell; for their benefit and blessing it is necessary to hold a discourse which bears its own moral clear and plain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3779"></a><a id="a3780"></a><span class="t30">So he summoned the Saṅgha together, and said: &ldquo;Monks, you must not win your necessaries by the one-and-twenty unlawful methods. Food won unlawfully is like a piece of redhot iron, like a deadly poison. These unlawful methods are blamed and rebuked by disciples of all Buddhas and Paccekabuddhas. For those who eat food gained by unlawful means there is no laughter and no joy. Food got in this way, in my dispensation, is like the leavings of a Caṇḍāla. To partake of it, for a disciple of the Dhamma, is like partaking of the leavings of a Caṇḍāla.&rdquo; And with these words, he told a story about the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as the son of a man of the lowest caste. When he grew up, he took the road for some purpose, taking for his provision some rice grains in a basket.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time there was a young fellow in Benares, named Satadhamma. He was the son of a householder, a northern brahmin. He also took the road for some purpose, but neither rice grains nor basket had he. The two met upon the highway. Said the young brahmin to the other, &ldquo;What caste are you of?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Of the lowest. And what are you?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.83}</span> &ldquo;Oh, I am a northern brahmin.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right, let us journey together,&rdquo; and so together they fared along. Breakfast time came. The Bodhisatta sat down where there was some nice water, and washed his hands, and opened his basket. &ldquo;Will you have some?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; says the other, &ldquo;I want none, you low fellow.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.58] </span>says the Bodhisatta. Careful to waste none, he put as much as he wanted in a leaf apart from the rest, fastened up his basket, and ate. Then he took a drink of water, washed his hands and feet, and picked up the rest of his rice and food. &ldquo;Come along, young sir,&rdquo; said he, and they started off again on their journey.</p>
<p class="p7">All day they tramped along; and at evening they both had a bath in some nice water. When they came out, the Bodhisatta sat down in a nice place, undid his parcel, and began to eat. This time he did not offer the other a share. The young gentleman was tired with walking all day, and hungry to the bottom of his soul; there he stood, looking on, and thinking: &ldquo;If he offers me any, I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo; But the other ate away without a word. &ldquo;This low fellow,&rdquo; thought the young man, &ldquo;eats every scrap without a word. Well, I&rsquo;ll beg a piece; I can throw away the outside, which is defiled, and eat the rest.&rdquo; And so he did; he ate what was left. As soon as he had eaten, he thought: &ldquo;How I have disgraced my birth, my clan, my family! Why, I have eaten the leavings of a low born churl!&rdquo; Keen indeed was his remorse; he threw up the food, and blood came with it. &ldquo;Oh, what a wicked deed I have done,&rdquo; he wept, &ldquo;all for the sake of a trifle!&rdquo; and he went on in the words of the first verse: <span class="t18">{2.84}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3781"></a><a id="a3782"></a><a id="a3783"></a><a id="a3784"></a><span class="t12">1. Tañ-ca appañ-ca ucchiṭṭhaṁ, tañ-ca kicchena no adā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3785"></a><a id="a3786"></a><a id="a3787"></a><span class="t12">Sohaṁ brāhmaṇajātiko, yaṁ bhuttaṁ tam-pi uggatan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">That is but small leftovers, given to us with difficulty, I am born a northern brahmin, whose food is also high class.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus did the young gentleman make his lamentation; adding, &ldquo;Why did I do such a wicked thing just for life&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo; He plunged into the jungle, and never let any eye see him again, but there he died forlorn.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this story was ended, the Teacher repeated, &ldquo;Just as the young brahmin, monks, after eating the leavings of a Caṇḍāla, found that neither laughter nor joy was for him, because he had taken improper food; so whosoever has embraced this dispensation, and gains a livelihood by unlawful means, when he eats the food and supports his life in any way that is blamed and disapproved by the Buddha, will find that there is no laughter and no joy for him.&rdquo; Then, after Fully Awakening, he repeated the second verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3788"></a><a id="a3789"></a><a id="a3790"></a><span class="t12">2. Evaṁ Dhammaṁ niraṁkatvā, yo adhammena jīvati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3791"></a><span class="t12">Satadhammo va lābhena, laddhena pi na nandatī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a3792"></a><a id="a3793"></a><a id="a3794"></a><a id="a3795"></a><span class="t4">Thus, disregarding the Dhamma, he who lives without the Dhamma, like Satadhamma, having gained, does not rejoice in what is gained. </span><span class="t18">{2.85}</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">When this discourse was concluded, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths many monks entered upon the Paths and the Fruit thereof, saying: &ldquo;At the time of the story I was the low-caste man.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h3 class="h30"><a id="ncx7075"></a><a id="a3796"></a><a id="a3797"></a><a id="a3798"></a><a id="a3799"></a><a id="a3800"></a>Ja 180 Duddadajātaka<br/>The Story about the Difficulty of (Giving) Gifts (2s)</h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present two brothers get together and give alms to the Buddha, and to the Saṅgha, who then praises their good deed. The Buddha then tells a story of how rich and poor banded together to give alms to a holy man in the past.</span></p>

Two friends at Sāvatthi, young men of good position, made a collection, providing all the necessaries to give the Buddha and his followers. They invited them all, provided bounty for seven days, and on the seventh presented them with all their requisites. The eldest of these saluted the Teacher, and said, sitting beside him, &ldquo;Sir, amongst the givers some gave much and some gave little; but let it bear much fruit for all alike.&rdquo; Then he offered the gift. The Teacher&rsquo;s reply was, &ldquo;In giving these things to the Buddha and his followers, you, my lay friends, have done a great deed. In days of old wise men gave their bounty thus, and thus offered their gifts.&rdquo; Then at his request he told a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a brahmin family of Kāsi. When he grew up, he was thoroughly educated at Taxila; after which he renounced the world, and took up the ascetic life, and with a band of disciples went to live in the Himālayas. There he lived a long time.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3804"></a>Once having need to procure salt and seasoning, he went on pilgrimage through the countryside, and in course of it he arrived at Benares. There he settled in the king&rsquo;s park; and on the following morning he and his company went begging to some village outside the gates. The people gave him alms. Next day he sought alms in the city. The people were all glad to give him their alms. They clubbed together and made a collection; and provided plenty for the band of ascetics. After the presentation their spokesman offered his gift with the same words as above. The Bodhisatta replied, &ldquo;Friend, where faith<a id="a3805"></a><a href="notes.html#a15073"><span class="t9">{405}</span></a> is, no gift is small.&rdquo; And he returned his thanks in these verses following: <span class="t18">{2.86}</span></p>

<p class="p23">This was his thanksgiving. He remained in the place for the four months of the rains, and then returned to the Himālayas; where he practised all the modes of holy meditation, and without a single interruption continued in them until he joined the hosts of heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse came to an end the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the Buddha&rsquo;s company was the body of ascetics, and I myself was their leader.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the Buddha talks about how he gave up his kingdom for the spiritual life, and then tells a story of how he renounced a throne in the past, and the great deeds he did as a master archer, including saving his former kingdom with just one shot of an arrow.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Prince Asadisa, skilled in archers&rsquo; craft.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.60]</span><a id="a3840"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about the Great Renunciation. The Teacher said: &ldquo;Not now alone, monks, has the Tathāgata made the Great Renunciation: in other days he also renounced the white parasol of royalty, and did the same.&rdquo; And he told a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{2.87}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was conceived as the son of the queen consort. She was safely delivered; and on his nameday they gave him the name of Asadisakumāra [prince Peerless]. About the time he was able to walk, the queen conceived one who was also to be a wise being. She was safely delivered, and on the nameday they called the babe Brahmadattakumāra [prince Heaven-sent].</p>
<p class="p7">When prince Asadisa was sixteen, he went to Taxila for his education. There at the feet of a world-famed teacher he learned the Three Vedas and the Eighteen Arts; in the science of archery he was peerless; then he returned to Benares.</p>
<p class="p7">When the king was on his deathbed he commanded that prince Asadisa should bhe king in his stead, and prince Brahmadatta heir apparent. Then he died; after which the kingship was offered to Asadisa, who refused, saying that he cared not for it. So they consecrated Brahmadatta to be king by sprinkling him. Asadisa cared nothing for glory, and wanted nothing.</p>
<p class="p7">While the younger brother ruled, Asadisa lived in all royal state. The slaves came and slandered him to his brother, &ldquo;Prince Asadisa wants to be king!&rdquo; said they. Brahmadatta believed them, and allowed himself to be deceived; he sent some men to take Asadisa prisoner.</p>
<p class="p7">One of prince Asadisa&rsquo;s attendants told him what was afoot. He waxed angry with his brother, and went away into another country. After arriving there, he sent in word to the king that an archer was come, and awaited him. &ldquo;What wages does he ask?&rdquo; the king enquired. &ldquo;A hundred thousand a year.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;let him enter.&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.61]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Asadisa came into the presence, and stood waiting. &ldquo;Are you the archer?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, I take you into my service.&rdquo; After that Asadisa remained in the service of this king. <span class="t18">{2.88}</span> But the old archers were annoyed at the wage which was given him, &ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; they grumbled.</p>
<p class="p7">One day it so happened that the king went out into his park. There, at foot of a mango tree, where a screen had been put up before a certain stone seat of ceremony, he reclined upon a magnificent couch. He happened to look up, and there right at the treetop he saw a cluster of mango fruit. &ldquo;It is too high to climb for,&rdquo; thought he; so summoning his archers, he asked them whether they could cut off that cluster with an arrow, and bring it down for him. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;that is not much for us to do. But your majesty has seen our skill often enough. The newcomer is so much better paid than we, that perhaps you might make him bring down the fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king sent for Asadisa, and asked him if he could do it. &ldquo;Oh yes, your Majesty, if I may choose my position.&rdquo; &ldquo;What position do you want?&rdquo; &ldquo;The place where your couch stands.&rdquo; The king had the couch removed, and gave place.</p>
<p class="p7">Asadisa had no bow in his hand; he used to carry it underneath his body-cloth; so he must needs have a screen. The king ordered a screen to be brought and spread for him, and our archer went in. He doffed the white cloth which he wore over all, and put on a red cloth next his skin; then he fastened his girdle, and donned a red waistcloth. From a bag he took out a sword in pieces, which he put together and girt on his left side. Next he put on a mailcoat of gold, fastened his bow-case over his back, and took out his great rams-horn bow, made in several pieces, which he fitted together, fixed the bowstring, red as coral; put a turban upon his head; twirling the arrow with his nails, he threw open the screen and came out, looking like a Nāga prince just emerging from the riven ground. He went to the place of shooting, arrow set to bow, and then put this question to the king. &ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;am I to bring this fruit down with an upward shot, <span class="t18">{2.89}</span> or by dropping the arrow upon it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;I have often seen a mark brought down by the upward shot, but never one taken in the fall. You had better make the shaft fall on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; said the archer, &ldquo;this arrow will fly high. Up to the heaven of the Four Great Kings it will fly, and then return of itself. You must please be patient till it returns.&rdquo; The king promised. Then the archer said again, &ldquo;Your Majesty, this arrow in its upshot will pierce the stalk exactly in the middle; and when it comes down, it will not swerve a hair&rsquo;s-breadth either way, but hit the same spot to a nicety, and <span class="t18">[2.62] </span>bring down the cluster with it.&rdquo; Then he sped the arrow forth swiftly. As the arrow went up it pierced the exact centre of the mango stalk. By the time the archer knew his arrow had reached the place of the Four Great Kings, he let fly another arrow with greater speed than the first. This struck the feather of the first arrow, and turned it back; then itself went up as far as the heaven of the Thirty-Three. There the deities caught and kept it.</p>
<p class="p7">The sound of the falling arrow as it cleft the air was as the sound of a thunderbolt. &ldquo;What is that noise?&rdquo; asked every man. &ldquo;That is the arrow falling,&rdquo; our archer replied. The bystanders were all frightened to death, for fear the arrow should fall on them; but Asadisa comforted them. &ldquo;Fear nothing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I will see that it does not fall on the earth.&rdquo; Down came the arrow, not a hairbreadth out either way, but neatly cut through the stalk of the mango cluster. The archer caught the arrow in one hand and the fruit in the other, so that they should not fall upon the ground. &ldquo;We never saw such a thing before!&rdquo; cried the onlookers, at this marvel. <span class="t18">{2.90}</span> How they praised the great man! How they cheered and clapped and snapped their fingers, thousands of kerchiefs waving in the air! In their joy and delight the courtiers gave presents to Asadisa amounting to ten millions of money. And the king too showered gifts and honours upon him like rain.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3841"></a>While the Bodhisatta was receiving such glory and honour at the hands of this king, seven kings, who knew that there was no prince Asadisa in Benares, drew a circle around the city, and summoned its king to fight or yield. The king was frightened out of his life. &ldquo;Where is my brother?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;He is in the service of a neighbouring king,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;If my dear brother does not come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am a dead man. Go, fall at his feet in my name, appease him, bring him here!&rdquo; His messengers came and did their errand. Asadisa took leave of his master, and returned to Benares. He comforted his brother and bade him fear nothing; then scratched<a id="a3842"></a><a href="notes.html#a15078"><span class="t9">{407}</span></a> a message upon an arrow to this effect, &ldquo;I, prince Asadisa, am returned. I mean to kill you all with one arrow which I will shoot at you. Let those who care for life make their escape.&rdquo; This he shot so that it fell upon the very middle of a golden dish, from which the seven kings were eating together. When they read the writing they all fled, half-dead with fright.</p>
<p class="p7">Thus did our prince put to flight seven kings, without shedding even so much blood as a little fly might drink; then, looking upon his younger brother, he renounced his sensual desires, and forsook the world, cultivated the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and at his life&rsquo;s end came to Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm. <span class="t18">[2.63] {2.91}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;And this is the way,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;that prince Asadisa routed seven kings and won the battle; after which he took up the ascetic life.&rdquo; Then becoming perfectly enlightened he uttered these two verses:</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;O elephant, a hero you.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying at Jetavana, about elder Nanda.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, on his first return to Kapila city, had received into the Saṅgha prince Nanda, his younger brother, and returned to Sāvatthi after and stayed there. Now Ven. Nanda, as he was leaving his home, after taking the bowl, in the Tathāgata&rsquo;s company, remembered how Janapadakalyāṇī was looking out of a window, with her hair half combed, and she said: &ldquo;Why, prince Nanda is off with the Teacher! &ndash; Come back soon, dear lord!&rdquo; remembering this, I say, he grew downcast and despondent, yellower and yellower, and the veins stood knotted over his skin.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher learned, of this, he thought: &ldquo;What if I could establish Nanda as an Arahat!&rdquo; To Nanda&rsquo;s cell he went, and sat on the seat which was offered him. &ldquo;Well, Nanda,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;are you content with our dispensation?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Nanda, &ldquo;I am in love with Janapadakalyāṇī, and I am not content.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you been on pilgrimage in the Himālayas, Nanda?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir, not yet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then we will go.&rdquo; &ldquo;But, sir, I have no Supernormal Powers; how can I go?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will take you, Nanda.&rdquo; So saying, the Teacher took him by the hand, and thus passed through the air.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On the way they passed over a burnt field. There, upon the charred stump of a tree, with nose and tail half gone, hair scorched off, and her hide a cinder, nothing but skin, all covered with blood, sat a female monkey. &ldquo;Do you see that monkey, Nanda?&rdquo; the Teacher asked. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take a good look at her,&rdquo; said he. Then he pointed out, stretching over sixty leagues, the uplands of Manosilā, the seven great lakes, Anotatta and the rest, the five great rivers, the whole Himālaya highlands, with the magnificent hills named of Gold, of Silver, and of Gems, and hundreds of other lovely spots. Next he asked, &ldquo;Nanda, have you ever seen the abode of the Thirty-Three?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{2.93}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;No, sir, never,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Come along, Nanda,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I will show you the abode of the Thirty-Three.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3875"></a><a id="a3876"></a><span class="t30">Therewith he brought him to the Yellowstone Throne,</span><a id="a3877"></a><a href="notes.html#a15080"><span class="t9">{408}</span></a><span class="t30"> and made him sit on it. Sakka, King of the Devas in two heavens, came with his host </span><span class="t18">[2.64] </span><a id="a3878"></a><span class="t30">of gods, gave greeting and sat down on one side. His handmaids to the number of twenty-five million, and five hundred </span><span class="t30">Accharā </span><span class="t30">with doves&rsquo; feet, came and made greeting, then sat down on one side. The Teacher made Nanda look at these five hundred </span><span class="t30">Accharā </span><span class="t30">again and again, with desire after them. &ldquo;Nanda&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you see these dove-footed </span><span class="t30">Accharā</span><span class="t30">? &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, which is prettier &ndash; they or Janapadakalyāṇī?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, sir! As that wretched ape was in comparison with Janapadakalyāṇī, so is she compared with these!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, Nanda, what are you going to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;How is it possible, sir, to win these nymphs?&rdquo; &ldquo;By living as an ascetic, sir,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;one may win these nymphs.&rdquo; The lad said: &ldquo;If the Fortunate One pledges his word that an ascetic life will win these nymphs, an ascetic life I will lead.&rdquo; &ldquo;Agreed, Nanda, I pledge my word. Well, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let us make a long business of it. Let us be off, and I will become an ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher brought him to Jetavana back again. The elder began to follow the ascetic life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher recounted to Sāriputta, the Captain of the Dhamma, how his younger brother had made him pledge himself in the midst of the gods in the heaven of the Thirty-Three about the </span><span class="t30">Devaccharā</span><span class="t30">. In the same manner, he told the story to elder Mahāmoggallāna, to elder Mahākassapa, to elder Anuruddha, to elder Ānanda, the Treasurer of the Dhamma, eighty great disciples in all; and then, one after the other, he told it to the other monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Captain of the Dhamma, elder Sāriputta, asked elder Nanda, &ldquo;Is it true, as I hear, friend, that you have the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; pledged word that you shall win the </span><span class="t30">Devaccharā</span><span class="t30"> in the heaven of the Thirty-Three, by passing your life as an ascetic? Then,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is not your holy life all bound up with womankind and lust? If you live chaste just for the sake of women, what is the difference between you and a labourer who works for hire?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{2.94}</span><span class="t30"> This saying quenched all the fire in him and made him ashamed of himself. In the same way all the eighty chief disciples, and all the rest of the monks, made this worthy monk ashamed. &ldquo;I have been wrong,&rdquo; thought he; in all shame and remorse, he got up his courage, and set to work to develop his spiritual insight. Soon he became an Arahat. He came to the Teacher, and said: &ldquo;Sir, I release the Fortunate One from his promise.&rdquo; The Teacher said: &ldquo;If you have become an Arahat, Nanda, I am thereby released from my promise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the monks heard of this, they began to talk about it over in their Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;How docile that elder Nanda is, to be sure! Why, friend, one word of advice awakened his sense of shame; at once he began to live as an ascetic and now he is an Arahat!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking about together. They told him. &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Nanda was just as docile in former days as he is now,&rdquo; and then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as an elephant-trainer&rsquo;s son. When he grew up, he was carefully taught all that pertains to the training of elephants. He was in the service of a king who was an enemy to the king of Benares. He trained this king&rsquo;s elephant of state to perfection.</p>
<p class="p7">The king determined to capture Benares. Mounting upon his state elephant, he led a mighty host against Benares, and laid siege to it. Then he sent a letter to the king of the city, &ldquo;Fight, or yield!&rdquo; The king chose to fight. Walls and gates, towers and battlements he manned with a great host, and defied the foe.</p>
<p class="p7">The hostile king armed his state elephant, and clad himself in armour, took a sharp goad in his hand, and drove his beast towards the city, &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.65] </span>said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll storm this city, and kill my enemy, and get his realms into my hands,&rdquo; But at sight of the defenders, who cast boiling mud, and stones from their catapults, and all kinds of missiles, the elephant was scared out of his wits and would not come near the place. Thereupon up came the trainer, crying, &ldquo;Son, a hero like you is quite at home in the battle-field! <span class="t18">{2.95}</span> In such a place it is disgraceful to turn tail!&rdquo; And to encourage his elephant, he uttered these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3879"></a><a id="a3880"></a><a id="a3881"></a><a id="a3882"></a><a id="a3883"></a><a id="a3884"></a><span class="t12">1. Saṅgāmāvacaro sūro balavā iti vissuto,</span></p>

<p class="p23">The elephant listened; one word of advice was enough to turn him. Winding his trunk about the shafts of the pillars, he tore them up like so many toadstools: he beat against the gateway, broke down the bars, and forcing his way through entered the city and won it for his king.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had finished this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;In those days Nanda was the elephant, Ānanda was the king, and the trainer was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

Of these, some were in the First Path, some in the Second, some in the Third, all had embraced this dispensation. They that invited the Teacher invited these also. But they had five hundred attendants waiting upon them, to bring them toothbrushes, mouth-water, and garlands of flowers; these lads used to eat their leftovers. After their meal, and a nap, they used to run down to the Aciravatī, and on the river bank they would wrestle like very Mallians,</span><a id="a3927"></a><a href="notes.html#a15085"><span class="t9">{410}</span></a><span class="t30"> shouting all the time. But the five hundred lay brethren were quiet, made very little noise, courted solitude. </span><span class="t18">[2.66]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher happened to hear the attendants shouting. &ldquo;What is that noise, Ānanda?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The attendants, who eat the leftovers,&rdquo; was the reply. The Teacher said: &ldquo;Ānanda, this is not the only time these attendants have fed on leftovers, and made a great noise after it; they used to do the same in the olden days; and then too these lay brethren were just as quiet as they are now.&rdquo; So saying, at his request, the Teacher told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3928"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as the son of one of his courtiers, and became the king&rsquo;s adviser in all things both temporal and spiritual. Word came to the king of a revolt on the frontier. He ordered five hundred chargers to be got ready, and an army complete in its four parts.<a id="a3929"></a><a href="notes.html#a15087"><span class="t9">{411}</span></a> With this he set out, and quelled the rising, after which he returned to Benares.</p>
<p class="p7">When he came home, he gave order, &ldquo;As the horses are tired, let them have some juicy food, some grape juice to drink.&rdquo; The steeds took this delicious drink, then retired to their stables and stood quietly each in his stall.</p>
<p class="p7">But there was a mass of leavings, with nearly all the goodness squeezed out of it. The keepers asked the king what to do with that. &ldquo;Knead it up with water,&rdquo; was his command, &ldquo;strain through a towel, and give it to the donkeys who carry the horses&rsquo; provender.&rdquo; This wretched stuff the donkeys drank up. It maddened them, and they galloped about the palace yard braying loudly.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3930"></a>From an open window the king saw the Bodhisatta, and called out to him. <span class="t18">{2.97}</span> &ldquo;Look there! How mad these donkeys are from that sorry drink! How they bray, how they caper! But those fine thoroughbreds that drank the strong liquor, they make no noise; they are perfectly quiet, and jump not at all. What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; and he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3931"></a><a id="a3932"></a><a id="a3933"></a><a id="a3934"></a><a id="a3935"></a><a id="a3936"></a><span class="t12">1. Vālodakaṁ apparasaṁ nihīnaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a3939"></a><a id="a3940"></a><a id="a3941"></a><a id="a3942"></a><span class="t4">This fibrous water, tasteless, inferior, drinking it, the donkeys became tipsy. Whereas after drinking this fine liquor the thoroughbreds did not become tipsy.</span></p>
<p class="p23">And the Bodhisatta explained the matter in the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3943"></a><span class="t12">2. Appaṁ pivitvāna nihīnajacco</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3944"></a><span class="t12">So majjatī tena janinda puṭṭho.</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a3948"></a><a id="a3949"></a><a id="a3950"></a><a id="a3951"></a><span class="t4">Having drunk just a little the low man taking it becomes drunk, leader of men. The patient one, born in good family, drinking the finest drink doesn&rsquo;t get drunk.</span></p>
<p class="p23">When the king had listened to the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s answer, he had the donkeys driven out of his courtyard. Then, abiding by the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s <span class="t18">[2.67] </span>advice, he gave alms and did good until he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka as follows, &ldquo;At that time these attendants were the five hundred asses, these lay brethren were the five hundred thoroughbreds, Ānanda was the king, and the wise courtier was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

The circumstances have already been recounted under the Mahilāmukhajātaka [Ja 26].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3962"></a><a id="a3963"></a><span class="t34">This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta, who, having secured the adherence of prince Ajātasattu, had attained both gain and honour. Prince Ajātasattu had a monastery built for Devadatta at Gayāsīsa, and every day brought to him five hundred pots of perfumed three-year-old rice flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. All this gain and honour brought Devadatta a great following, with whom Devadatta lived on, without ever stirring out of his monastery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At that time there were living in Rājagaha two friends, of whom one had taken the vows under the Teacher, while the other had taken them under Devadatta. And these continued to see one another, either casually or by visiting the monasteries. Now one day the disciple of Devadatta said to the other, &ldquo;Sir, why do you daily go round for alms with the sweat streaming off you? Devadatta sits quietly at Gayāsīsa and feeds on the best of fare, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. There&rsquo;s no way like his. Why create misery for yourself? Why should it not be a good thing for you to come the first thing in the morning to the monastery at Gayāsīsa and there drink our rice-gruel with a relish after it, try our eighteen kinds of solid victuals, and enjoy our excellent soft food, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Being pressed time after time to accept the invitation, the other began to want to go, and thenceforth used to go to Gayāsīsa and there eat and eat, not forgetting however to return to the Bamboo Grove at the proper hour. Nevertheless he could not keep it secret always; and in a little while it came out that he used to go to Gayāsīsa and there regale himself with the food provided for Devadatta. Accordingly, his friends asked him, saying: &ldquo;Is it true, as they say, that you regale yourself on the food provided for Devadatta?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;So-and-so said it.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true, sirs, that I go to Gayāsīsa and eat there. But it is not Devadatta who gives me food; others do that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, Devadatta is the foe of the Buddhas; in his wickedness, he has secured the adherence of Ajātasattu and by unrighteousness got gain and honour for himself. Yet you who have taken the vows according to this dispensation which leads to safety, eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness. Come; let us bring you before the Teacher.&rdquo; And, taking with them the monk, they went to the Dhamma Hall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3964"></a><span class="t34">When the Teacher became aware of their presence, he said: &ldquo;Monks, are you bringing this monk here against his will?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir; this monk, after taking the vows under you, eats the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it true, as they say, that you eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness?&rdquo; &ldquo;It was not Devadatta, sir, that gave it me, but others.&rdquo; &ldquo;Raise no quibbles here, monk,&rdquo; said the Teacher. &ldquo;Devadatta is a man of bad conduct and bad principle. Oh, how could you, who have taken the vows in the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation, eat Devadatta&rsquo;s food, while living in the Teacher&rsquo;s presence? But you have always been prone to being led away, and have followed in turn every one you meet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Again, as before, the Teacher said: &ldquo;In former days this monk kept bad company just as he does now.&rdquo; Then he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, there was a king named Sāma [Blackie], reigning in Benares. In those days the Bodhisatta was one of a courtier&rsquo;s family, and grew up to be the king&rsquo;s temporal and spiritual adviser. Now the king had a state horse named Paṇḍava, and one Giridanta was his trainer, a lame man. The horse used to watch him as he tramped on and on in front, holding the halter; and knowing him to be his trainer, imitated him and limped too.</p>
<p class="p7">Somebody told the king how the horse was limping. The king sent surgeons. They examined the horse, but found him perfectly sound; and so accordingly made report. Then the king sent the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;Go, friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and find out all about it.&rdquo; He soon found out that the horse was lame because he went about with a lame trainer. So he told the king what it was. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case of bad company,&rdquo; said he, and went on to repeat the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3965"></a><span class="t12">1. Dūsito Giridattena, hayo Sāmassa Paṇḍavo,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3966"></a><a id="a3967"></a><span class="t12">Porāṇaṁ pakatiṁ hitvā, tassevānuvidhiyyatī ti.</span></p>

<p class="p23">&ldquo;Well, now, my friend,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; &ldquo;Get a good groom,&rdquo; replied the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;and the horse will be as good as ever.&rdquo; Then he repeated the second verse: <span class="t18">{2.99}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a3973"></a><a id="a3974"></a><a id="a3975"></a><a id="a3976"></a><a id="a3977"></a><a id="a3978"></a><span class="t12">2. Sace ca tanujo poso, sikharākārakappito,</span></p>

<p class="p23">The king did so. The horse became as good as before. The king showed great honour to the Bodhisatta, being pleased that he knew even the ways of animals.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, when this discourse was ended, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Devadatta was Giridanta in those days; the monk who keeps bad company was the horse; and the wise counsellor was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one young brahmin learns the Vedas, but through the worries and occupations of his household life he forgets what he had learned. The Buddha tells a similar story from the past, showing how only a tranquil mind has good recollection.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a3994"></a><span class="t30">A young brahmin, as they say, belonging to Sāvatthi, had mastered the Three Vedas, and used to teach the mantras to a number of young brahmins and nobles. In time he settled down as a married man. His thoughts being now busy with wealth and ornaments, serving men and serving women, lands and substance, kine and buffaloes, sons and daughters, he became subject to passion, error and folly. This obscured his wits, so that he forgot how to repeat his mantras in due order, and every now and then the charms did not come clear in his mind.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This man one day procured a quantity of flowers and sweet scents, and these he took to the Teacher in Jetavana. After his greeting, he sat down on one side. </span><span class="t18">{2.100}</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher talked pleasantly to him. &ldquo;Well, young sir, you are a teacher of the mantras. Do you know them all by heart?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, sir, I used to know them all right, but since I married my mind has been darkened, and I don&rsquo;t know them any longer.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, young sir,&rdquo; the Teacher said, &ldquo;just the same happened before; at first your mind was clear, and you knew all your verses perfectly, but when your mind was obscured by passions and sensual desires, you could no longer clearly see them.&rdquo; Then at his request the Teacher told the following story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in the family of a brahmin householder. When he grew up, he studied under a far-famed teacher of Taxila, where he learned all <span class="t18">[2.69] </span>the mantras. After returning to Benares he taught these mantras to a large number of brahmin and noble youths.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a3995"></a>Amongst these youths was one young brahmin who had learned the Three Vedas by heart; he became a master of ritual,<a id="a3996"></a><a href="notes.html#a15089"><span class="t9">{412}</span></a> and could repeat the whole of the sacred texts without stumbling in a single line. By and by he married and settled down. Then household cares clouded his mind, and no longer could he repeat the mantras.</p>
<p class="p7">One day his teacher paid him a visit. &ldquo;Well, young sir,&rdquo; he enquired, &ldquo;do you know all your verses off by heart?&rdquo; &ldquo;Since I have been the head of a household,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;my mind has been clouded, and I cannot repeat them.&rdquo; &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said his teacher, &ldquo;when the mind is clouded, no matter how perfectly the mantras have been learned, they will not stand out clear. But when the mind is serene there is no forgetting them.&rdquo; And thereupon he repeated the two verses following:</p>

Yet you who have taken the vows according to this dispensation which leads to safety, eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness. Come; let us bring you before the Teacher.&rdquo; And, taking with them the monk, they went to the Dhamma Hall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When the Teacher became aware of their presence, he said: &ldquo;Monks, are you bringing this monk here against his will?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir; this monk, after taking the vows under you, eats the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it true, as they say, that you eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness?&rdquo; &ldquo;It was not Devadatta, sir, that gave it me, but others.&rdquo; &ldquo;Raise no quibbles here, monk,&rdquo; said the Teacher. &ldquo;Devadatta is a man of bad conduct and bad principle. Oh, how could you, who have taken the vows in the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation, eat Devadatta&rsquo;s food, while living in the Teacher&rsquo;s presence? But you have always been prone to being led away, and have followed in turn every one you meet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Again the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, bad </span><span class="t18">[2.70] </span><span class="t30">company is evil and injurious; why should one talk of the evil effects of bad company on human beings? In days long gone by, even a vegetable, a mango tree, whose sweet fruit was a dish fit for the gods, turned sour and bitter through the influence of a noisome and bitter nimb tree.&rdquo; Then he told a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, four brahmins, brothers, of the land of Kāsi, left the world and became ascetics; they built themselves four huts in a row in the highlands of the Himālayas, and there they lived.</p>
<p class="p7">The eldest brother died, and was born as Sakka. Knowing who he had been, he used to visit the others every seven or eight days, and lend them a helping hand.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, he visited the eldest of the ascetics, and after the usual greeting, took his seat to one side. <span class="t18">{2.102}</span> &ldquo;Well, sir, how can I serve you?&rdquo; he enquired. The ascetic, who was suffering from jaundice, replied, &ldquo;Fire is what I want.&rdquo; Sakka gave him a razor-axe. (A razor-axe is so called because it serves as razor or as axe according as you fit it into the handle.) &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the ascetic, &ldquo;who is there to get me firewood with this?&rdquo; &ldquo;If you want a fire, sir,&rdquo; replied Sakka, &ldquo;all you have to do is to strike your hand upon the axe, and say &ndash; &lsquo;Fetch wood and make a fire!&rsquo; The axe will fetch the wood and make you the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">After giving him this razor-axe he next visited the second brother, and asked him the same question, &ldquo;How can I serve you, sir?&rdquo; Now there was an elephant track by his hut, and the creatures annoyed him. So he told Sakka that he was annoyed by elephants, and wanted them to be driven away. Sakka gave him a drum. &ldquo;If you beat upon this side, sir,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;your enemies will run away; but if you strike the other, they will become your firm friends, and will encompass you with an army in fourfold array.&rdquo; Then he handed him the drum.</p>
<p class="p7">Lastly he made a visit to the youngest, and asked as before how he could serve him. He too had jaundice, and what he said was, &ldquo;Please give me some curds.&rdquo; Sakka gave him a milk-bowl, with these words, &ldquo;Turn this over if you want anything, and a great river will pour out of it, and will flood the whole place, and it will be able even to win a kingdom for you.&rdquo; With these words he departed.</p>
<p class="p7">After this the axe used to make fire for the eldest brother, the second used to beat upon one side of his drum and drive the elephants away, and the youngest had his curds to eat.</p>
<p class="p7">About this time a wild boar, that lived in a ruined village, lit upon a gem possessed of magic power. Picking up the gem in his mouth, he rose in the air by its magic. From afar he could see an isle in mid-ocean, and there he resolved to live. So descending he chose a pleasant spot beneath a mango tree, <span class="t18">{2.103}</span> and there he made his abode. <span class="t18">[2.71]</span></p>
<p class="p7">One day he fell asleep under the tree, with the jewel lying in front of him. Now a certain man from the Kāsi country, who had been turned out of doors by his parents as a never-do-well, had made his way to a seaport, where he embarked on shipboard as a sailors&rsquo; drudge. In mid-sea the ship was wrecked, and he floated upon a plank to this island. As he wandered in search of fruit, he espied our boar fast asleep. Quietly he crept up, seized the gem, and found himself by magic rising through the air! He alighted on the mango tree, and pondered. &ldquo;The magic of this gem,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;has taught that boar to be a sky-walker; that&rsquo;s how he got here, I suppose. Well! I must kill him and make a meal of him first; and then I&rsquo;ll be off.&rdquo; So he snapped off a twig, dropping it upon the boar&rsquo;s head. The boar woke up, and seeing no gem, ran trembling up and down. The man up in the tree laughed. The boar looked up, and seeing him ran his head against the tree, and killed himself.</p>
<p class="p7">The man came down, lit a fire, cooked the boar and made a meal. Then he rose up in the sky, and set out on his journey.</p>
<p class="p7">As he passed over the Himālayas, he saw the ascetics&rsquo; settlement. So he descended, and spent two or three days in the eldest brother&rsquo;s hut, entertaining and entertained, and he found out the virtue of the axe. He made up his mind to get it for himself. So he showed our ascetic the virtue of his gem, and offered to exchange it for the axe. The ascetic longed to be able to pass through mid-air,<a id="a4036"></a><a href="notes.html#a15095"><span class="t9">{415}</span></a> and struck the bargain. The man took the axe, and departed; but before he had gone very far, he struck upon it, and said: &ldquo;Axe! Smash that ascetic&rsquo;s skull and bring the gem to me!&rdquo; Off flew the axe, clove the ascetic&rsquo;s skull, and brought the gem back.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the man hid the axe away, and paid a visit to the second brother. <span class="t18">{2.104}</span> With him the visitor stayed a few days, and soon discovered the power of his drum. Then he exchanged his gem for the drum, as before, and as before made the axe cleave the owner&rsquo;s skull. After this he went on to the youngest of the three ascetics, found out the power of the milk-bowl, gave his jewel in exchange for it, and as before sent his axe to cleave the man&rsquo;s skull. Thus he was now owner of jewel, axe, drum, and milk-bowl, all four.</p>
<p class="p7">He now rose up and passed through the air. Stopping nearby Benares, he wrote a letter which he sent by a messenger&rsquo;s hands, that the king must either fight him or yield. On receipt of this message the king sallied forth to seize the scoundrel. But he beat on one side of his drum, and was promptly surrounded by an army in fourfold array. When he saw that the king had deployed his forces, he then overturned the milk-bowl, and a great river poured forth; multitudes were drowned <span class="t18">[2.72] </span>in the river of curds. Next he struck upon his axe. &ldquo;Fetch me the king&rsquo;s head!&rdquo; cried he; away went the axe, and came back and dropped the head at his feet. Not a man could raise a hand against him.</p>
<p class="p7">So encompassed by a mighty host, he entered the city, and caused himself to be anointed king under the title of king Dadhivāhana, or Carried-on-the-Curds, and he ruled righteously.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, as the king was amusing himself by casting a net into the river, he caught a mango fruit, fit for the gods, which had floated down from lake Kaṇṇamuṇḍa. When the net was hauled out, the mango was found, and shown to the king. It was a huge fruit, as big as a basin, round, and golden in colour. The king asked what the fruit was: Mango, said the foresters. He ate it, and had the seed planted in his park, and watered with milk-water.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4037"></a>The tree sprouted up, and in three years it bore fruit. Great was the worship paid to this tree; milk-water was poured about it; perfumed garlands with five spray<a id="a4038"></a><a href="notes.html#a15097"><span class="t9">{416}</span></a> were hung upon it; wreaths were festooned about it; a lamp was kept burning, and fed with scented oil; and all round it was a screen of cloth. The fruit was sweet, and had the colour of fine gold. King Dadhivāhana, before sending presents of these mangoes to other kings, <span class="t18">{2.105}</span> used to prick with a thorn that place in the stone where the sprout would come from, for fear of their growing the like by planting it. When they ate the fruit, they used to plant the stone; but they could not get it to take root. They enquired the reason, and learned how the matter was.</p>
<p class="p7">One king asked his gardener whether he could spoil the flavour of this fruit, and turn it bitter on the tree. Yes, the man said he could; so his king gave him a thousand pieces and sent him on his errand.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4039"></a>So soon as he had arrived in Benares, the man sent a message to the king that a gardener was come. The king admitted him to the presence. After the man had saluted him, the king asked, &ldquo;You are a gardener?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; said the man, and began to sound his own praises. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you may go and assist my park-keeper.&rdquo; So after that these used both to look after the royal grounds.</p>
<p class="p7">The newcomer managed to make the park look more beautiful by forcing flowers and fruit out of their season. This pleased the king, <span class="t18">[2.73] </span>so that he dismissed the former keeper and gave the park into sole charge of the new one. No sooner had this man got the park into his own hands than he planted nimbs and creepers about the choice mango tree. By and by the nimbs sprouted up. Above and below, root with root, and branch with branch, these were all entangled with the mango tree. Thus this tree, with its sweet fruit, grew bitter as the bitter-leaved nimb by the company of this noxious and sour plant. As soon as the gardener knew that the fruit had gone bitter, he took to his heels.</p>
<p class="p7">King Dadhivāhana went walking in his pleasure gardens, and took a bite of the mango fruit. The juice in his mouth tasted like a nasty nimb; swallow it he could not, so he coughed it up and spat it out. Now at that time the Bodhisatta was his temporal and spiritual counsellor. The king turned to him. &ldquo;Wise sir, this tree is as carefully cared for as ever, and yet its fruit has gone bitter. What&rsquo;s the meaning of it?&rdquo; and asking this question, he repeated the first verse: <span class="t18">{2.106}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4040"></a><a id="a4041"></a><span class="t12">1. Vaṇṇagandharasūpeto, amboyaṁ ahuvā pure,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4042"></a><a id="a4043"></a><a id="a4044"></a><span class="t12">Tam-eva pūjaṁ labhamāno, kenambo kaṭukapphalo ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">This mango was previously endowed with colour, fragrance, taste, was received with honour, why is this mango now a bitter fruit?</span></p>
<p class="p23">The Bodhisatta explained the reason in the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4045"></a><a id="a4046"></a><a id="a4047"></a><a id="a4048"></a><a id="a4049"></a><span class="t12">2. Pucimandaparivāro ambo te Dadhivāhana,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4050"></a><a id="a4051"></a><span class="t12">Mūlaṁ mūlena saṁsaṭṭhaṁ, sākhā sākhā nisevare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4052"></a><span class="t12">Asātasannivāsena tenambo kaṭukapphalo ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4053"></a><a id="a4054"></a><span class="t4">Dadhivāhana, your mango is surrounded by </span><span class="t43">nimba</span><a id="a4055"></a><a id="a4056"></a><a id="a4057"></a><span class="t4"> trees, the roots are mixed up with roots, the branches are entwined with branches, through association with the bad the mango has bitter fruit.</span></p>
<p class="p23">On hearing this the Bodhisatta caused all the nimbs and creepers to be removed, and their roots pulled up; the noxious soil was all taken away, and sweet earth put in its place; and the tree was carefully fed with sweet water, milk-water, scented water. Then by absorbing all this sweetness its fruit grew sweet again. The king put his former gardener in charge of the park, and after his life was done passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;In those days I was the wise counsellor.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one vain old monk comes and sits with the two chief disciples and offers to teach them. They walk away in disgust. The Buddha tells a story of how a jackal interrupted the virtuous talk of two geese and a Devatā in a tree, and how they flew away back to the Himālayas.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Sit and sing.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying at Jetavana, about an old monk. Once, we are told, the two chief disciples were sitting together, questioning and answering; when up came an old monk, and </span><span class="t18">[2.74] </span><span class="t30">made a third. </span><span class="t18">{2.107}</span><span class="t30"> Taking a seat, he said: &ldquo;I have a question too, sirs, which I should like to ask you, and if you have any difficulty, you may put it to me.&rdquo; The elders were disgusted; they rose up and left him. The Saṅgha who listened to the discourse of the elders, after the meeting broke up, came to the Teacher; he asked what brought them there untimely and they told him what had happened. He replied, &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that Sāriputta and Moggallāna have been disgusted with this man, and left him without a word; it was just the same in olden days.&rdquo; And he proceeded to tell a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta became a Tree Devatā that lived in a forest. Two young geese flew down from Mount Cittakūṭa and perched upon this tree. They flew about in search of food, returned there again, and after resting flew back to their mountain home. As time went on and on, the Devatā struck up a friendship with them. Coming and going, they were great friends, and used to talk about the dispensation to one another before they parted.</p>
<p class="p7">It happened one day as the birds sat on the treetop, talking with the Bodhisatta, that a jackal, halting at the foot of the tree, addressed the young geese in the words of the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4065"></a><a id="a4066"></a><a id="a4067"></a><span class="t12">1. Ucce viṭabhim-āruyha, mantayavho rahogatā,</span></p>

<p class="p23">Filled with disgust, the young geese took wing and flew back to Cittakūṭa. When they were gone, the Bodhisatta repeated the second verse for the jackal&rsquo;s benefit:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4079"></a><a id="a4080"></a><a id="a4081"></a><span class="t12">2. Yaṁ suvaṇṇo suvaṇṇena, Devo Devena mantaye,</span></p>

They say that Kokālika one day hearing a number of wise monks preaching, desired to preach himself; all the rest is like the circumstances given in a previous tale.</span><a id="a4102"></a><a href="notes.html#a15099"><span class="t9">{417}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4103"></a><span class="t34">At this time we hear that there were a number of very learned monks in the district of Manosilā, who spoke out like young lions, loud enough to bring down the heavenly Ganges, while reciting passages of scripture before the Saṅgha. As they recited their texts, Kokālika (not knowing what an empty fool he showed himself) thought he would like to do the same. So he went about among the monks saying: &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t ask me to recite a piece of scripture. If they were to ask me, I would do it.&rdquo; All the Saṅgha got to know of it and they thought they would try him. &ldquo;Friend Kokālika,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;give the Saṅgha a recital of some scriptures today.&rdquo; To this he agreed, not knowing his folly; that day he would recite before the Saṅgha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">He first partook of gruel made to his liking, ate some food, and had some of his favourite soup. At sundown the gong sounded for sermon time; all the Saṅgha gathered together. The &lsquo;yellow robe&rsquo; which he put on was blue as a bluebell; his outer robe was pure white. Thus clad, he entered the meeting, greeted the elders, stepped up to a Dhamma Seat under a grand jewelled pavilion, holding an elegantly carved fan, and sat down, ready to begin his recitation. But just at that moment beads of sweat began to start out all over him, and he felt ashamed. The first verse of the first verse he repeated; but what came next he could not think. So rising from the seat in confusion, he passed out through the meeting, and sought his own cell. Someone else, a real scholar, recited the scripture. After that all the monks knew how empty he was.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">One day the monks fell a talking of it in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Friend, it was not easy to see formerly how empty Kokālika is; but now he has given tongue of his own accord, and shown it.&rdquo; The Teacher entered, and asked what they were discussing together. They told him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This time again the Teacher on hearing of it said: &ldquo;Not this once only has Kokālika been shown up for what he was worth by means of his own voice; the very same thing happened before.&rdquo; And he told a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4104"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was a lion in the Himālayas mountains, and he had a cub by a female jackal who mated with him. The cub was just like his father in toes, claws, mane, colour, figure &ndash; all these; but in voice he was like his mother.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, after a shower of rain, all the lions were gambolling together and roaring; the cub thought he would like to roar too, and yelped like a jackal. On hearing which all the lions fell silent at once! Another cub of the same sire, own brother of this one, heard the sound, and said: &ldquo;Father, that lion is like us in colour and everything except in voice. Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo; in asking which question he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4105"></a><a id="a4106"></a><a id="a4107"></a><span class="t12">1. Sīhaṅgulī sīhanakho, sīhapādapatiṭṭhito,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4108"></a><span class="t12">So sīho sīhasaṅghamhi eko nadati aññathā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4109"></a><a id="a4110"></a><a id="a4111"></a><span class="t4">Lion&rsquo;s toes, lion&rsquo;s claws, you stand on lion&rsquo;s feet, but this lion makes sound other than lion&rsquo;s pride. </span><span class="t18">{2.109}</span></p>
<p class="p23">In answer the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your brother, the jackal&rsquo;s cub; like me in form, but in voice like his mother.&rdquo; Then he gave a word of advice to the other cub, &ldquo;My dear son, as long as you live here keep a quiet tongue in your head. If you give tongue again, they&rsquo;ll all find out that you are a jackal.&rdquo; To drive the advice home he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4112"></a><a id="a4113"></a><span class="t12">2. Mā tvaṁ nadi rājaputta, appasaddo vane vasa,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4114"></a><a id="a4115"></a><span class="t12">Sarena kho taṁ jāneyyuṁ, na hi te pettiko saro ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4116"></a><span class="t4">Do not cry out, prince, live quietly in the woods, they know by the voice, this is not your father&rsquo;s voice.</span></p>
<p class="p23">After this advice the creature never again so much as tried to roar.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had finished this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;In those days Kokālika was the jackal, Rāhula was the brother cub, and the king of beasts was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Nor lion, nor tiger I see.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.76]</span><span class="t30"> This story, like the last, was about Kokālika, told by the Teacher in Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At this time we hear that there were a number of very learned monks in the district of Manosilā, who spoke out like young lions, loud enough to bring down the heavenly Ganges, while reciting passages of scripture before the Saṅgha. As they recited their texts, Kokālika (not knowing what an empty fool he showed himself) thought he would like to do the same. So he went about among the monks saying: &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t ask me to recite a piece of scripture. If they were to ask me, I would do it.&rdquo; All the Saṅgha got to know of it and they thought they would try him. &ldquo;Friend Kokālika,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;give the Saṅgha a recital of some scriptures today.&rdquo; To this he agreed, not knowing his folly; that day he would recite before the Saṅgha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">He first partook of gruel made to his liking, ate some food, and had some of his favourite soup. At sundown the gong sounded for sermon time; all the Saṅgha gathered together. The &lsquo;yellow robe&rsquo; which he put on was blue as a bluebell; his outer robe was pure white. Thus clad, he entered the meeting, greeted the elders, stepped up to a Dhamma Seat under a grand jewelled pavilion, holding an elegantly carved fan, and sat down, ready to begin his recitation. But just at that moment beads of sweat began to start out all over him, and he felt ashamed. The first verse of the first verse he repeated; but what came next he could not think. So rising from the seat in confusion, he passed out through the meeting, and sought his own cell. Someone else, a real scholar, recited the scripture. After that all the monks knew how empty he was.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">One day the monks fell a talking of it in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Friend, it was not easy to see formerly how empty Kokālika is; but now he has given tongue of his own accord, and shown it.&rdquo; The Teacher entered, and asked what they were discussing together. They told him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This time he wanted to intone. The Teacher on hearing of it told the following story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a farmer&rsquo;s family, and when he grew up he got a livelihood by tillage.</p>
<p class="p7">At the same time there was a merchant who used to go about hawking goods, which a donkey carried for him. Wherever he went, he used to take his bundle off the ass, and throw a lionskin over him, <span class="t18">{2.110}</span> and then turn him loose in the rice and barley fields. When the watchmen saw this creature, they imagined him to be a lion, and so did not come near him.</p>
<p class="p7">One day this hawker stopped at a certain village, and while he was getting his own breakfast cooked, he turned the ass loose in a barley field with the lionskin on. The watchmen thought it was a lion, and did not come near, but fled home and gave the alarm. All the villagers armed themselves, and hurried to the field, shouting and blowing on conchs and beating drums. The ass was frightened out of his wits, and gave a hee-haw! Then the Bodhisatta, seeing that it was a donkey, repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4125"></a><span class="t12">1. Netaṁ sīhassa naditaṁ, na byagghassa na dīpino,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4126"></a><a id="a4127"></a><span class="t12">Pāruto sīhacammena, jammo nadati gadrabho ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">This is not a lion&rsquo;s sound, nor is it a tiger&rsquo;s or leopard&rsquo;s, but wrapped with a lion&rsquo;s skin, a contemptible donkey cries out.</span></p>
<p class="p23">As soon as the villagers learned that it was only an ass, they cudgelled him till they broke his bones, and then went off with the lion-skin. When the merchant appeared, and found that his ass had come to grief, he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4128"></a><a id="a4129"></a><a id="a4130"></a><span class="t12">2. Ciram-pi kho taṁ khādeyya gadrabho haritaṁ yavaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4131"></a><span class="t12">Pāruto sīhacammena, ravamāno va dūsayī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4132"></a><a id="a4133"></a><a id="a4134"></a><span class="t4">For a long time the donkey may have eaten grass and barley, while covered with a lionskin, but he spoiled it all by braying. </span><span class="t18">[2.77]</span></p>
<p class="p23">As he was in the act of uttering these words, the ass expired. The merchant left him, and went his way.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Kokālika was the ass, and the wise farmer was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
