<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;In fear of death.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{4.413}</span><a id="a11624"></a><a id="a11625"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, about the venerable Ānanda, who made renunciation of his life. This renunciation will be described in Book XXI, under the Cullahaṁsajātaka [Ja 533], the Subduing of Dhanapāla.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11626"></a><a id="a11627"></a><a id="a11628"></a><span class="t34">This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, as to how the venerable Ānanda renounced his life. For when archers were instigated to slay the Tathāgata, and the first one that was sent by Devadatta on this errand returned and said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, I cannot deprive the Fortunate One of life: he is possessed of great Supernormal Powers,&rdquo; Devadatta replied, &ldquo;Well, sir, you need not slay the ascetic Gotama. I myself will deprive him of life.&rdquo; And as the Tathāgata was walking in the shadow cast westward by the Vulture&rsquo;s Peak, Devadatta climbed to the top of the mountain and hurled a mighty stone as if shot from a catapult, thinking: &ldquo;With this stone will I slay the ascetic Gotama,&rdquo; but two mountain peaks meeting together intercepted the stone, and a splinter from it flew up and struck the Fortunate One on the foot and drew blood, and severe pains set in. Jīvaka, cutting open the Tathāgata&rsquo;s foot with a knife, let out the bad blood and removed the proud flesh, and anointing the wound with medicine, healed it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Teacher moved about just as he did before, surrounded by his attendants, with all the great charm of a Buddha. So on seeing him Devadatta thought: &ldquo;Verily no mortal beholding the excellent beauty of Gotama&rsquo;s person dare approach him, but the king&rsquo;s elephant Nāḷāgiri is a fierce and savage animal and knows nothing of the virtues of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. He will bring about the destruction of the ascetic.&rdquo; So he went and told the matter to the king. The king readily fell in with the suggestion, and, summoning his elephant-keeper, thus addressed him, &ldquo;Sir, tomorrow you are to make Nāḷāgiri mad with drink, and at break of day to let him loose in the street where the ascetic Gotama walks.&rdquo; And Devadatta asked the keeper how much arrack the elephant was wont to drink on ordinary days, and when he answered, &ldquo;Eight pots,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Tomorrow give him sixteen pots to drink, and send him in the direction of the street frequented by the ascetic Gotama.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the keeper. The king had a drum beaten throughout the city and proclaimed, &ldquo;Tomorrow Nāḷāgiri will be maddened with strong drink and let loose in the city. The men of the city are to do all that they have to do in the early morning and after that no one is to venture out into the street.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">And Devadatta came down from the palace and went to the elephant stall and, addressing the keepers, said: &ldquo;We are able, I tell you, from a high position to degrade a man to a lowly one and to raise a man from a low position to a high one. If you are eager for honour, early tomorrow morning give Nāḷāgiri sixteen pots of fiery liquor, and at the time when the ascetic Gotama comes that way, wound the elephant with spiked goads, and when in his fury he has broken down his stall, drive him in the direction of the street where Gotama is wont to walk, and so bring about the destruction of the ascetic.&rdquo; They readily agreed to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This rumour was noised abroad throughout the whole city. The lay disciples attached to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, on hearing it, drew near to the Teacher and said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, Devadatta has conspired with the king and tomorrow he will have Nāḷāgiri let loose in the street where you walk. Do not go into the city tomorrow for alms but remain here. We will provide food in the monastery for the monastics, with Buddha at their head.&rdquo; The Teacher without directly saying: &ldquo;I will not enter the city tomorrow for alms,&rdquo; answered and said: &ldquo;Tomorrow I will work a miracle and tame Nāḷāgiri and crush the heretics. And without going around for alms in Rājagaha I will leave the city, attended by a company of the monks, and go straight to the Bamboo Grove, and the people of Rājagaha shall repair there with many a bowl of food and tomorrow there shall be a meal provided in the refectory of the monastery.&rdquo; In this way did the Teacher grant their request.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">And on learning that the Tathāgata had acceded to their wishes, they set out from the city, carrying bowls of food, and saying: &ldquo;We will distribute our gifts in the monastery itself.&rdquo; And the Teacher in the first watch taught the Dhamma, in the middle watch he solved hard questions, in the first part of the last watch he lay down lion-like on his right side, and the second part he spent in the Attainment of Fruition, in the third part, entering into a trance of deep pity for the sufferings of humanity, he contemplated all his kinsfolk that were ripe for conversion and seeing that as the result of his conquest of Nāḷāgiri eighty-four thousand beings would be brought to a clear understanding of the Dhamma, at daybreak, after attending to his bodily necessities, he addressed Ānanda and said: &ldquo;Ānanda, today bid all the monks that are in the eighteen monasteries that are round about Rājagaha to accompany me into the city.&rdquo; The elder did so, and all the monks assembled at the Bamboo Grove.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Teacher attended by a great company of monks entered Rājagaha and the elephant-keepers proceeded according to their instructions and there was a great gathering of people. The believers thought: &ldquo;Today there will be a mighty battle between the Buddha Nāga and this elephant Nāga of the brute world. We shall witness the defeat of Nāḷāgiri by the incomparable skill of the Buddha,&rdquo; and they climbed up and stood upon the upper storeys and roofs and house-tops. But the unbelieving heretics thought: &ldquo;Nāḷāgiri is a fierce, savage creature, and knows nothing of the merits of Buddhas and the like. Today he will crush the glorious form of the ascetic Gotama and bring about his death. Today we shall look upon the back of our enemy.&rdquo; And they took their stand on upper storeys and other high places.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">And the elephant, on seeing the Fortunate One approach him, terrified the people by demolishing the houses and raising his trunk he crushed the wagons into powder, and, with his ears and tail erect with excitement, he ran like some towering mountain in the direction of the Fortunate One. On seeing him the monks thus addressed the Fortunate One, &ldquo;This Nāḷāgiri, venerable sir, a fierce and savage creature, and a slayer of men, is coming along this road. Of a truth he knows nothing of the merit of Buddhas and the like. Let the Fortunate One, the Auspicious One, withdraw.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fear not, monks,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I am able to overcome Nāḷāgiri.&rdquo; Then the venerable Sāriputta prayed the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;Venerable sir, when any service has to be rendered to a father, it is a burden laid on his eldest son. I will vanquish this creature.&rdquo; Then the Teacher said: &ldquo;Sāriputta, the power of a Buddha is one thing, that of his disciples is another,&rdquo; and he rejected his offer, saying: &ldquo;You are to remain here.&rdquo; This too was the prayer of the eighty chief elders for the most part, but he refused them all.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then the venerable Ānanda by reason of his strong affection for the Teacher was unable to acquiesce in this and cried, &ldquo;Let this elephant kill me first,&rdquo; and he stood before the Teacher, ready to sacrifice his life for the Tathāgata. So the Teacher said to him, &ldquo;Go away, Ānanda, do not stand in front of me.&rdquo; The elder said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, this elephant is fierce and savage, a slayer of men, like the flame at the beginning of a cycle. Let him first slay me and afterwards let him approach you.&rdquo; And though he was spoken to for the third time, the elder remained in the same spot and did not retire. Then the Fortunate One by the exercise of his Supernormal Powers made him fall back and placed him in the midst of the monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this venerable man had renounced his life for the Teacher&rsquo;s sake, they gossiped about it in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Sirs, the venerable Ānanda, having attained to the analytic knowledges of the one still in training, renounced his life for the One with Ten Powers.&rdquo; The Teacher came in, asking what they spoke of as they sat there. They told him. Said he, &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time he has laid down his life for my sake; he has done it before.&rdquo; Then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, his chief consort&rsquo;s name was Khemā. At that time the Bodhisatta was born in the Himālayas region, as a stag: he was golden-hued and beautiful, and his younger brother, named Cittamiga, or Dapple Deer, was also of the colour of gold, and so also his younger sister Sutanā. Now the Great Being&rsquo;s name was Rohanta, and he was king of the deer. Traversing two ranges of the mountains, in the third he lived beside a lake called lake Rohanta, and surrounded by a herd of eighty thousand deer. He used to support his parents, who were old and blind.</p>
<p class="p7">Now a hunter, who lived in a village of hunters near Benares, came to the Himālayas, and saw the Great Being. He returned to his <span class="t18">[4.258] </span>village, and on his death-bed told his son, &ldquo;My boy, in such a part of our hunting-ground there is a golden deer; if the king should ask, you may tell him of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">One day queen Khemā, in the dawn, saw a dream, and this was the manner of that dream. A gold-coloured stag sat on a golden seat, and he discoursed to the queen on the Dhamma with a honey-sweet voice, like the sound of a golden bell tinkling. She listened with great delight to this discourse, but before the discourse was ended the deer rose and went away; and she awoke, crying out, &ldquo;Catch me the stag!&rdquo; The attendants, hearing her cry, burst out laughing. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the house shut close, door and window; not even a breath of air can get in, and at such a time my lady calls out to catch her the stag!&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.414}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11629"></a>By this time she understood that it was a dream. But she said to herself, &ldquo;If I say, it is a dream, the king will make no account of it; but if I say, it is my woman&rsquo;s craving, he will attend to it with all care. I will hear the discourse of the golden stag!&rdquo; Then she lay down as though sick. The king came in, &ldquo;What is wrong with my queen?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Oh, my lord, only my natural craving.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo; &ldquo;I wish to hear the discourse of a righteous golden stag.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, my lady, what you crave does not exist: there is no such thing as a golden stag.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get it, I must die on the spot.&rdquo; She turned her back on the king, and lay still. &ldquo;If there is one, it shall be caught,&rdquo; said the king. Then he questioned his courtiers and brahmins, just as in the Morajātaka [Ja 129], whether there were such things as golden deer. Finding that there were, he summoned the huntsmen, and asked, &ldquo;Which of you has seen or heard of such a creature?&rdquo; The son of the hunter we spoke of told the story as he heard it. &ldquo;My man,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;when you bring me this deer I will reward you richly; go and bring it here.&rdquo; He gave the money for his expenses, and dismissed him. The man said: &ldquo;Never fear: if I cannot bring the stag I will bring his skin; if I can&rsquo;t get that I will bring his hair.&rdquo; Then the man returned home, and gave the king&rsquo;s money to his family. Then he went out and saw the royal stag. &ldquo;Where shall I lay my snare,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;so as to catch him?&rdquo; He saw his chance at the drinking-place. He twisted a stout cord of leather thongs, and set it with a pole at the place where the Great Being went down to drink water.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11630"></a><a id="a11631"></a><a id="a11632"></a>Next day, the Great Being with the eighty thousand deer during his search for food came there to drink water at the usual ford. Just as he was going down, he was caught in the noose. Then he thought: &ldquo;If I cry out the cry of capture, all my troop will flee in <span class="t18">[4.259] </span>terror without drinking.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.415}</span> Although he was fast at the end of the pole, he stood pretending to drink, as if he were free. When the eighty thousand deer had drunk, and now stood clear of the water, he thrice jerked at the noose, to break it if possible. The first time he cut his skin, the second time cut into his flesh, and the third time he strained a tendon, so that the snare touched the bone. Then, unable to break it, he uttered the cry of capture: all the herd of deer being terrified fled in three troops. Cittamiga could not see the Great Being in any of the three troops, &ldquo;This danger,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;which has come upon us, has fallen on my brother.&rdquo; Then returning, he saw him there fast caught. The Great Being caught sight of him, and cried, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand there, brother, there is danger here!&rdquo; Then, urging him to flee, he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;In fear of death, O Cittaka, those herds of creatures flee:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Go you with them, and linger not, for they shall live with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The three verses which follow are said by the two alternately:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;No, no, Rohanta, I&rsquo;ll not go; my heart has drawn me near;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;m ready to lay down my life, I will not leave you here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11633"></a><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Then blind, with none to care for them, our parents</span><a id="a11634"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16451"><span class="t19">{1058}</span></a><span class="t12"> both must die:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O go, and let them live with you: O do not linger nigh!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;No, no, Rohanta, I&rsquo;ll not go; my heart has drawn me near;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;m ready to lay down my life, I will not leave you here.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.416}</span></p>
<p class="p6">He took his stand, supporting the Bodhisatta on the right side, and cheering him.</p>
<p class="p7">Sutanā also, the young doe, ran about among the deer, but could not find her brothers anywhere. &ldquo;This danger,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;must have fallen upon my brothers.&rdquo; She turned back and came to them; and the Great Being, as he saw her come, repeated the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Go, timid doe, and run away; an iron snare holds me:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Go with the rest, and linger not, and they shall live with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The three next verses are said alternately as before:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;No, no, Rohanta, I&rsquo;ll not go; my heart has drawn me near;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;m ready to lay down my life, I will not leave you here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Then blind, with none to care for them, our parents both must die:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O go, and let them live with you: O do not linger nigh!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;No, no, Rohanta, I&rsquo;ll not go; my heart has drawn me near;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ll lose my life, but never leave you snared and captured here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus she also refused to obey; and stood by his left side consoling him.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the huntsman saw the deer scampering off, and heard the cry of capture. &ldquo;It must be the king of the herd is caught!&rdquo; he said; and, tightening his girdle, he grasped the spear to kill him, <span class="t18">[4.260] </span>and ran quickly up. The Great Being repeated the ninth verse as he saw him coming:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;The furious hunter, arms in hand, see him approaching near!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And he will slay us here today with arrow or with spear.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.417}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11635"></a>Citta did not flee, though he saw the man. But Sutanā, not being strong enough to stand still, ran a little way for fear of death. Then with the thought: &ldquo;Where shall I flee if I desert my two brothers?&rdquo; she returned again, renouncing her own life,<a id="a11636"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16453"><span class="t9">{1059}</span></a> with death on her brow, and stood by the left side of her brother.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher recited the tenth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;The tender doe in panic fear a little way did fly,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then did a thing most hard to do, for she returned to die.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the hunter came up, he saw these three creatures standing together. A pitiful thought arose in his heart, as he guessed they were brothers and sister born of one womb. &ldquo;Only the king of the herd,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;is caught in the snare; the other two are bound with the ties of honour. What kin can they be to him?&rdquo; which question he asked thus:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;What are these deer that wait upon the prisoner, though free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor for the sake of very life will leave him here, and flee?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta answered:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;My brother and my sister these, of one same mother born:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor for the sake of very life will leave me here forlorn.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">These words made his heart more exceedingly soft. Citta, that royal stag, perceiving that his heart grew soft, said: &ldquo;Friend hunter, do not imagine that this creature is a deer and no more. He is king of fourscore thousand deer, one of virtuous life, tenderhearted to all creatures, of great wisdom; he supports his sire and dam, now blind and old. If you slay a righteous being like this, in slaying him you slay dam and sire, my sister and me, all five; but if you grant my brother his life, you bestow life on the five of us.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.418}</span> Then he repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;Grown blind, with none to care for them, they both will perish so:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O grant you life to all the five, and let my brother go!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the hunter heard this pious discourse, he was glad at heart. &ldquo;Fear not, my lord,&rdquo; said he, and repeated the next verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;So be it: see I now set free the parent-fostering deer:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His parents when they find him safe shall make a merry cheer.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.261]</span></p>
<p class="p6">As he said this, he thought: &ldquo;What do I want with the king and his honours? If I hurt this royal deer, either the earth will gape and swallow me up, or a thunderbolt will fall and strike me. I will let him go.&rdquo; So approaching the Great Being, he pulled down the pole, and cut the leather thong; then he embraced the deer, and laid him close to the water, tenderly and gently loosed him out of the noose, joined the ends of the tendon, and the lips of the flesh-wound, and the edges of the skin, washed off the blood with water, pitifully massaged him again and again. By the power of his love and the Great Being&rsquo;s perfection all grew whole again, sinews, flesh, and skin, hide and hair covered the foot, no one could have guessed where he had been wounded. The Great Being stood there, full of happiness. Citta looked on him and rejoiced, and rendered thanks to the hunter in this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;Hunter, be happy now, and may your kindred happy be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As I am happy to behold the mighty stag set free.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now the Great Being thought: &ldquo;Is it of his own doing this hunter snared me, or at the bidding of another?&rdquo; and he asked the cause of his capture. The huntsman said: &ldquo;My lord, I have nothing to do with you; but the king&rsquo;s consort, Khemā, desires to hear you discourse on righteousness; therefore I snared you at the king&rsquo;s bidding.&rdquo; &ldquo;That being so, my good friend, you did a bold thing to set me free. <span class="t18">{4.419}</span> Come, bring me to the king, and I will discourse before the queen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed, my lord, kings are cruel. Who knows what may come of it? I don&rsquo;t care for any honour the king might show me: go where you will.&rdquo; But again the Great Being thought it was a bold thing to set him free; he must give him a chance of winning the promised honour. So he said: &ldquo;Friend, massage my back with your hand.&rdquo; He did so; his hand became covered with golden hairs. &ldquo;What shall I do with these hairs, my lord?&rdquo; &ldquo;Take them, my friend, show them to the king and queen, tell them here are hairs from that golden stag; take my place, and discourse to them in the words of these verses I shall repeat: when she hears you, that will alone be sufficient to satisfy her craving.&rdquo; &ldquo;Recite the Dhamma, O king!&rdquo; said the man; and the other taught him ten verses of the holy life, and described the five precepts, and dismissed him with a warning to be vigilant. The hunter treated the Great Being as one would treat a teacher: thrice he walked round him right-wise, did the four obeisances, and wrapping the hairs in a lotus leaf went away. The three animals accompanied him for a little way, then after feeding and drinking, returned to their parents.</p>
<p class="p7">Father and mother questioned him, &ldquo;Rohanta, my son, we heard you were caught, and how came you free?&rdquo; They put the question in a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;How did you win your liberty when life was nearly done:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How did the hunter set you free from treacherous trap, my son?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.262]</span></p>
<p class="p6">In answer to which the Bodhisatta repeated three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;Cittaka won me liberty with words that charmed the ear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That touched the heart, that pierced the heart, words uttered sweet and clear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. Sutanā won me liberty with words that charmed the ear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That touched the heart, that pierced the heart, words uttered sweet and clear.</span><span class="t18"> {4.420}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. The hunter gave me liberty, these charming words to hear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That touched the heart, that pierced the heart, words uttered sweet and clear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">His parents expressed their gratitude, saying:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. &ldquo;He with his wife and family, O happy may they be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As we are happy to behold Rohanta now set free!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now the huntsman came out of the wood, and went to the king; then saluting him stood on one side. The king when he saw him said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. &ldquo;Come tell me, hunter: do you say, &lsquo;See the deer&rsquo;s hide I bring&rsquo;:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or have you no deer&rsquo;s hide to show because of any thing?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The hunter replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;Into my hands the creature came, into my privy snare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And was fast caught: but others, free, attended on him there.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. Then pity made my flesh to creep, a pity strange and new.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If I should slay this deer (thought I) then I shall perish too.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. &ldquo;What were these deer, O hunter, what their nature and their ways,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What colour theirs, what quality, to merit such high praise?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king put this question several times over, as one much astonished. The hunter replied in this verse: <span class="t18">{4.421}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. &ldquo;With silvery horns and graceful shape, with hide and fell most bright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Red slot, and shining brilliant eyes all lovely to the sight.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">As he repeated this verse, the huntsman placed in the king&rsquo;s hand those golden hairs of the Great Being, and in another verse summed up the description of the character of these deer:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. &ldquo;Such is their nature and their ways, my lord, and such these deer:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They used to find their parents food: I could not fetch them here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11637"></a>In these words he described the qualities of the Great Being, and of the stag Citta, and of Sutanā the doe; adding this, &ldquo;The royal stag, O king, showed me his hairs, commanding me to take his place, and to declare the Dhamma before the queen in ten verses of a holy life.&rdquo;<a id="a11638"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16455"><span class="t9">{1060}</span></a><a id="a11639"></a> <span class="t18">{4.422}</span> Then sitting upon a golden throne, he declared the Dhamma in these verses.<a id="a11640"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16457"><span class="t9">{1061}</span></a><span class="t18"> [4.263]</span></p>

<p class="p6">In this manner did the huntsman declare the Dhamma, as the Great Being had shown him, with a Buddha&rsquo;s skill, as though he were bringing down to earth the heavenly Ganges. The crowd with a thousand voices cried approval. The queen&rsquo;s longing was satisfied when she heard the discourse.</p>
<p class="p7">The king was pleased, and repeated these verses, as he rewarded the huntsman with great honour.</p>

<p class="p6">When he heard these words of the king&rsquo;s, he answered, &ldquo;No house or home for me; grant me, my lord, to become an ascetic.&rdquo; The king&rsquo;s consent given, he handed over the king&rsquo;s rich gifts to his wife and family, and went away to the Himālayas, where he embraced the ascetic life, and cultivated the Eight Attainments, and became destined for the Brahmā Realm. And the king clave to the Great One&rsquo;s teaching, and went to swell the hosts of heaven. The teaching endured for a thousand years.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This discourse ended, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Thus, monks, long ago as now Ānanda renounced life for my sake.&rdquo; Then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time, Channa was the huntsman and Sāriputta the king, the sister was queen Khemā; some of the king&rsquo;s family were the father and mother, Uppalavaṇṇā was Sutanā, Ānanda was Citta, the Sākiya clan were the eighty thousand deer, and I was myself the royal stag Rohanta.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;There go the birds.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[4.264] </span><span class="t30">This story the Teacher told while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, about elder Ānanda&rsquo;s renunciation of life.</span><a id="a11655"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16464"><span class="t9">{1064}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11656"></a><span class="t34">This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, as to how the venerable Ānanda renounced his life. For when archers were instigated to slay the Tathāgata, and the first one that was sent by Devadatta on this errand returned and said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, I cannot deprive the Fortunate One of life: he is possessed of great Supernormal Powers,&rdquo; Devadatta replied, &ldquo;Well, sir, you need not slay the ascetic Gotama. I myself will deprive him of life.&rdquo; And as the Tathāgata was walking in the shadow cast westward by the Vulture&rsquo;s Peak, Devadatta climbed to the top of the mountain and hurled a mighty stone as if shot from a catapult, thinking: &ldquo;With this stone will I slay the ascetic Gotama,&rdquo; but two mountain peaks meeting together intercepted the stone, and a splinter from it flew up and struck the Fortunate One on the foot and drew blood, and severe pains set in. Jīvaka, cutting open the Tathāgata&rsquo;s foot with a knife, let out the bad blood and removed the proud flesh, and anointing the wound with medicine, healed it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Teacher moved about just as he did before, surrounded by his attendants, with all the great charm of a Buddha. So on seeing him Devadatta thought: &ldquo;Verily no mortal beholding the excellent beauty of Gotama&rsquo;s person dare approach him, but the king&rsquo;s elephant Nāḷāgiri is a fierce and savage animal and knows nothing of the virtues of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. He will bring about the destruction of the ascetic.&rdquo; So he went and told the matter to the king. The king readily fell in with the suggestion, and, summoning his elephant-keeper, thus addressed him, &ldquo;Sir, tomorrow you are to make Nāḷāgiri mad with drink, and at break of day to let him loose in the street where the ascetic Gotama walks.&rdquo; And Devadatta asked the keeper how much arrack the elephant was wont to drink on ordinary days, and when he answered, &ldquo;Eight pots,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Tomorrow give him sixteen pots to drink, and send him in the direction of the street frequented by the ascetic Gotama.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the keeper. The king had a drum beaten throughout the city and proclaimed, &ldquo;Tomorrow Nāḷāgiri will be maddened with strong drink and let loose in the city. The men of the city are to do all that they have to do in the early morning and after that no one is to venture out into the street.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">And Devadatta came down from the palace and went to the elephant stall and, addressing the keepers, said: &ldquo;We are able, I tell you, from a high position to degrade a man to a lowly one and to raise a man from a low position to a high one. If you are eager for honour, early tomorrow morning give Nāḷāgiri sixteen pots of fiery liquor, and at the time when the ascetic Gotama comes that way, wound the elephant with spiked goads, and when in his fury he has broken down his stall, drive him in the direction of the street where Gotama is wont to walk, and so bring about the destruction of the ascetic.&rdquo; They readily agreed to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This rumour was noised abroad throughout the whole city. The lay disciples attached to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, on hearing it, drew near to the Teacher and said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, Devadatta has conspired with the king and tomorrow he will have Nāḷāgiri let loose in the street where you walk. Do not go into the city tomorrow for alms but remain here. We will provide food in the monastery for the monastics, with Buddha at their head.&rdquo; The Teacher without directly saying: &ldquo;I will not enter the city tomorrow for alms,&rdquo; answered and said: &ldquo;Tomorrow I will work a miracle and tame Nāḷāgiri and crush the heretics. And without going around for alms in Rājagaha I will leave the city, attended by a company of the monks, and go straight to the Bamboo Grove, and the people of Rājagaha shall repair there with many a bowl of food and tomorrow there shall be a meal provided in the refectory of the monastery.&rdquo; In this way did the Teacher grant their request.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">And on learning that the Tathāgata had acceded to their wishes, they set out from the city, carrying bowls of food, and saying: &ldquo;We will distribute our gifts in the monastery itself.&rdquo; And the Teacher in the first watch taught the Dhamma, in the middle watch he solved hard questions, in the first part of the last watch he lay down lion-like on his right side, and the second part he spent in the Attainment of Fruition, in the third part, entering into a trance of deep pity for the sufferings of humanity, he contemplated all his kinsfolk that were ripe for conversion and seeing that as the result of his conquest of Nāḷāgiri eighty-four thousand beings would be brought to a clear understanding of the Dhamma, at daybreak, after attending to his bodily necessities, he addressed Ānanda and said: &ldquo;Ānanda, today bid all the monks that are in the eighteen monasteries that are round about Rājagaha to accompany me into the city.&rdquo; The elder did so, and all the monks assembled at the Bamboo Grove.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Teacher attended by a great company of monks entered Rājagaha and the elephant-keepers proceeded according to their instructions and there was a great gathering of people. The believers thought: &ldquo;Today there will be a mighty battle between the Buddha Nāga and this elephant Nāga of the brute world. We shall witness the defeat of Nāḷāgiri by the incomparable skill of the Buddha,&rdquo; and they climbed up and stood upon the upper storeys and roofs and house-tops. But the unbelieving heretics thought: &ldquo;Nāḷāgiri is a fierce, savage creature, and knows nothing of the merits of Buddhas and the like. Today he will crush the glorious form of the ascetic Gotama and bring about his death. Today we shall look upon the back of our enemy.&rdquo; And they took their stand on upper storeys and other high places.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">And the elephant, on seeing the Fortunate One approach him, terrified the people by demolishing the houses and raising his trunk he crushed the wagons into powder, and, with his ears and tail erect with excitement, he ran like some towering mountain in the direction of the Fortunate One. On seeing him the monks thus addressed the Fortunate One, &ldquo;This Nāḷāgiri, venerable sir, a fierce and savage creature, and a slayer of men, is coming along this road. Of a truth he knows nothing of the merit of Buddhas and the like. Let the Fortunate One, the Auspicious One, withdraw.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fear not, monks,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I am able to overcome Nāḷāgiri.&rdquo; Then the venerable Sāriputta prayed the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;Venerable sir, when any service has to be rendered to a father, it is a burden laid on his eldest son. I will vanquish this creature.&rdquo; Then the Teacher said: &ldquo;Sāriputta, the power of a Buddha is one thing, that of his disciples is another,&rdquo; and he rejected his offer, saying: &ldquo;You are to remain here.&rdquo; This too was the prayer of the eighty chief elders for the most part, but he refused them all.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then the venerable Ānanda by reason of his strong affection for the Teacher was unable to acquiesce in this and cried, &ldquo;Let this elephant kill me first,&rdquo; and he stood before the Teacher, ready to sacrifice his life for the Tathāgata. So the Teacher said to him, &ldquo;Go away, Ānanda, do not stand in front of me.&rdquo; The elder said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, this elephant is fierce and savage, a slayer of men, like the flame at the beginning of a cycle. Let him first slay me and afterwards let him approach you.&rdquo; And though he was spoken to for the third time, the elder remained in the same spot and did not retire. Then the Fortunate One by the exercise of his Supernormal Powers made him fall back and placed him in the midst of the monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then also the monks were talking in the Dhamma Hall about the elder&rsquo;s good qualities, when the Teacher came in and asked them what they sat talking about there. He said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that Ānanda has renounced his life for my sake, but he did the same before.&rdquo; And then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, there reigned in Benares a king named Bahuputtaka, or the Father of Many Sons, and his queen consort was Khemā. At that time the Great Being dwelt on Mount Cittakūṭa, and he was the chief of ninety thousand wild geese, having come to life as a golden goose. <span class="t18">{4.424}</span><a id="a11657"></a><a id="a11658"></a> And at that time, as already recounted, the queen saw a dream, and told the king she had conceived a woman&rsquo;s craving to hear a golden goose discourse on the Dhamma. When the king enquired, were there any such creatures as golden geese, he was told Yes, there were on Mount Cittakūṭa. Then he had made a lake which he called Khemā, and caused to be planted all manner of food-corn, and daily in the four quarters made proclamation of immunity to be cried, and sent forth a hunter to catch geese. How this man was sent forth, and his watching of the birds, and how news was told the king when the golden geese came, and in what manner the snare was set and the Great Being was caught in the snare, how Sumukha chief captain of the geese saw him not in the three divisions of the geese, and returned, all this will be set forth in the Mahāhaṁsajātaka [Ja 534].<a id="a11659"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16466"><span class="t9">{1065}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11660"></a><span class="t11">He summoned his wise brahmins and after telling them that there were golden geese on Cittakūṭa, he asked if they knew any way to catch them. They said: &ldquo;Sire, what need for us to go and catch them? By a stratagem we will bring them down close to the city and catch them.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is this stratagem?&rdquo; &ldquo;On the north of the city, sire, you are to have a lake dug, three leagues in extent, a safe and peaceful spot, and filling it with water, plant all manner of grain and cover the lake with the five kinds of lotus. Then hand it over to the care of a skilful fowler and suffer no one to approach it, and by means of men stationed at the four corners have it proclaimed as a sanctuary lake, and on hearing this all manner of birds will alight there. And these geese, hearing one from another how safe this lake is, will visit it and then you can have them caught, trapping them with hair nooses.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The king, on hearing this, had a lake such as they described formed in the place they mentioned, and summoning a skilled fowler he presented him with a thousand pieces of money and said: &ldquo;Henceforth give up your occupation: I will support your wife and family. Carefully guarding this peaceful lake and driving everyone away from it, have it proclaimed at the four corners as a sanctuary, and say that all the birds that come and go are mine, and when the golden geese arrive you shall receive great honour.&rdquo; With these words of encouragement the king put him in charge of the sanctuary lake. From that day the fowler acted just as the king bade him and watched over the place, and as one that kept the lake in peace he came to be known as the fowler Khema (Peace).</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Thenceforth all manner of birds alighted there, and from its being proclaimed from one to another that the lake was peaceful and secure, different kinds of geese arrived. First of all came the grass-geese, then owing to their report came the yellow geese, followed in like manner by the scarlet geese, the white geese and the Oka geese. On their arrival Khemaka thus reported to the king, &ldquo;Five kinds of geese, sire, have come, and they are continually feeding in the lake. Now that the pāka geese have arrived, in a few days the golden geese will be coming: cease to be anxious, sire.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The king on hearing this made proclamation in the city by beat of drum that no one was to go there, and whosoever should do so should suffer mutilation of hands and feet and spoliation of his household goods; and from that time no one went there. Now the pāka geese dwell not far from Cittakūṭa in Golden Cave. They are very powerful birds and as with the Dhataraṭṭha family of geese the colour of their body is distinctive, but the daughter of the king of the pāka geese is gold-coloured. So her father, thinking she was a fitting match for the Dhataraṭṭha king, sent her to be his wife. She was dear and precious in her lord&rsquo;s eyes, and owing to this the two families of geese became very friendly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now one day the geese that were in attendance on the Bodhisatta inquired of the pāka geese, &ldquo;Where are you getting your food just now?&rdquo; &ldquo;We are feeding near Benares, on a safe piece of water; but where are you roaming?&rdquo; &ldquo;To such and such a place,&rdquo; they answered. &ldquo;Why do you not come to our sanctuary? It is a charming lake, teeming with all manner of birds, covered over with five kinds of lotus, and abounding with various grains and fruits, and buzzing with swarms of many different bees. At its four corners is a man to proclaim perpetual immunity from danger. No one is allowed to come near: much less to injure another.&rdquo; After this manner did they sing the praises of the peaceful lake.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">On hearing what the pāka geese said, they told Sumukha, saying: &ldquo;They tell us, near Benares is a peaceful lake of such and such a kind: there the pāka geese go and feed. Do you tell the Dhataraṭṭha king, and, if he allows us, we too will go and feed there.&rdquo; Sumukha told the king, who thought: &ldquo;Men, verily, are full of wiles and have skill in means, there must be some reason for this. All this long time past there was no such lake: it must have been made now to catch us.&rdquo; And he said to Sumukha, &ldquo;Let not this going there meet with your approval. This lake was not constructed by them in good faith; it was made to catch us. Men surely are cruel minded and have skill in means, keep still in your own feeding grounds.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The golden geese a second time told Sumukha they were anxious to visit the lake of Peace and he reported their wishes to the king. The Great Being thought: &ldquo;My kinsfolk must not be vexed by reason of me: we will go there.&rdquo; So accompanied by ninety thousand geese he went and browsed there, disporting himself after the manner of geese and then returned to Cittakūṭa.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Khemaka, after they had fed and taken their departure, went and reported their arrival to the king of Benares. The king was highly pleased and said: &ldquo;Friend Khemaka, try and catch one or two geese and I will confer great honour on you.&rdquo; With these words he paid his expenses and sent him away. Returning there the fowler seated himself in a skeleton pot and watched the movements of the geese.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Bodhisattas verily are free from all greed. Therefore the Great Being, starting from the spot where he alighted, went on eating the paddy in due order. All the others wandered about, eating here and there. So the fowler thought: &ldquo;This goose is free from greed: this is the one I must catch.&rdquo; The next day before the geese had alighted on the lake, he went to the place nearby and concealing himself in the framework of his pot he remained there sitting in it and looking through a chink in the frame. At that moment the Great Being escorted by ninety thousand geese came down on the same spot where he had alighted the day before, and sitting down at the limit of yesterday&rsquo;s feeding ground he went on browsing. The fowler, looking through a chink in his cage and marking the extraordinary beauty of the bird, thought: &ldquo;This goose is as big as a wagon, gold-coloured and with its neck encircled with three stripes of red. Three lines running down the throat pass along the middle of the belly, while other three stripes run down and mark off the back, and its body shines like a mass of gold poised on a string made of the thread of red wool. This must be their king, and this is the one I will seize.&rdquo; And the goose-king, after feeding over a wide field, disported himself in the water and then surrounded by his flock returned to Cittakūṭa. For six days he fed after this manner. On the seventh day Khemaka twisted a big stout cord of black horse-hair and fixed a noose upon a stick, and, knowing for certain the goose-king would alight tomorrow on the same spot, he set the stick on which the snare was mounted in the water.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The next day the goose-king coming down stuck its foot, as it alighted, into the snare, which grasping the bird&rsquo;s foot as it were with a band of iron held it fast in its grip. The bird, thinking to sever the snare, dragged at it and struck it with all its force. First its gold-coloured skin was bruised, next its flesh of the colour of red wool was cut, then the sinew was severed and last of all its foot would have been broken, but thinking a maimed body was unbefitting a king, it ceased to struggle.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">As severe pains set in, it thought: &ldquo;If I should utter a cry of capture, my kinsfolk would be alarmed and without feeding properly they would fly away, and being half-starved they would drop into the water.&rdquo; So putting up with the pain it remained in the power of the snare, pretending to be feeding on the paddy, but when the flock had eaten their fill, and were now disporting themselves after the manner of geese, it uttered a loud cry of capture. The geese on hearing it flew away, just as previously described. Sumukha, too, considering the matter, just as related before, searched about and not finding the Great Being in the three main divisions of the geese, thought: &ldquo;Verily this must be something terrible that has come upon the king,&rdquo; and he turned back, saying: &ldquo;Fear not, sire, I will release you at the sacrifice of my own life,&rdquo; and sitting down on the mud he comforted the Great Being.</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now as then the Great Being was caught in the noose and stick; and even as he hung in the noose at the end of the stick, he stretched forth his neck looking along the way that the geese had gone, and espying Sumukha as he came, thought: &ldquo;When he comes I will put him to the test.&rdquo; So when he came, the Great Being repeated three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;There go the birds, the ruddy geese, all overcome with fear:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O golden-yellow Sumukha, depart! What want you here?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. My kith and kin deserted me, away they all have flown,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Without a thought they fly away: why are you left alone?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Fly, noble bird! With prisoners no fellowship can be:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sumukha, fly! Nor lose the chance while you may yet be free.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.265] {4.425}</span></p>
<p class="p6">To which Sumukha replied, sitting on the mud:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll not leave you, royal goose, when trouble draweth nigh:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But stay I will, and by your side will either live or die.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus Sumukha, with a lion&rsquo;s note; and Dhataraṭṭha answered with this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;A noble heart, brave words are these, Sumukha, which you say:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas but to put you to the test I bade you fly away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">As they were thus conversing together, up came the huntsman, staff in hand, at the top of his speed. Sumukha encouraged Dhataraṭṭha, and flew to meet the man, respectfully declaring the virtues of the royal bird. Immediately the hunter&rsquo;s heart was softened; which Sumukha perceiving, went back, and stood encouraging the king of the geese. And the hunter approaching the king of the geese, recited the sixth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;They foot it by unfooted ways, birds flying in the sky:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And did you not, O noble goose, afar the snare espy?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;When life is coming to an end, and death&rsquo;s hour draws anigh,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11661"></a><span class="t12">Though you may close upon it come nor trap nor snare you spy.&rdquo;</span><a id="a11662"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16468"><span class="t19">{1066}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{4.426}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The hunter, pleased with the bird&rsquo;s remark, then addressed three verses to Sumukha.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;There go the birds, the ruddy geese, all overcome with fear:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And you, O golden-yellow fowl, are still left waiting here.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. They ate and drank, the ruddy geese: uncaring, they are flown;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Away they scurry through the air, and you are left alone.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. What is this fowl, that when the rest deserting him have flown,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though free, you join the prisoner &ndash; why are you left alone?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sumukha replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;He is my comrade, friend, and king, dear as my life is he:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Forsake him &ndash; no, I never will, until death calls for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the hunter was much pleased, and thought within him, &ldquo;If I should harm virtuous creatures like these, the earth would gape open and swallow me up. What care I for the king&rsquo;s reward? I will set them free.&rdquo; And he repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;Now seeing that for friendship&rsquo;s sake you are prepared to die,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I set your king and comrade free, to follow where you fly.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">This said, he drew down Dhataraṭṭha from the stick, and loosed the noose, and took him to the bank, and pitifully washed the blood from him, <span class="t18">{4.427}</span> and set the dislocated muscles and tendons. And by reason of his <span class="t18">[4.266] </span><a id="a11663"></a>kindness of heart, and by the might of the Great Being&rsquo;s Perfections,<a id="a11664"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16470"><span class="t9">{1067}</span></a> on the instant his foot became whole again, and not a mark showed where he had been caught. Sumukha beheld the Great Being with joy, and gave thanks in these words:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11665"></a><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;With all your kindred and your friends, O hunter, happy be,</span><a id="a11666"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16472"><span class="t19">{1068}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As I am happy to behold the king of birds set free.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the hunter heard this, he said: &ldquo;Now you may depart, friend.&rdquo; Then the Great Being said to him, &ldquo;Did you capture me for your own purposes, my good sir, or at the bidding of another?&rdquo; He told him the facts. The other wondered whether it were better to return to Cittakūṭa, or go to the town. &ldquo;If I go to the town,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;the hunter will be rewarded, the queen&rsquo;s craving will be appeased, Sumukha&rsquo;s friendship will be made known, then also by virtue of my wisdom I shall receive the lake Khemā, as a free gift. It is better therefore to go to the city.&rdquo; This determined, he said: &ldquo;Huntsman, take us on your carrying-pole to the king, and he shall set me free if he will.&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, kings are hard; go your ways.&rdquo; &ldquo;What! I have softened a hunter like you, and shall I not find favour with a king? Leave that to me; your part, friend, is to convey us to him.&rdquo; The man did so.</p>
<p class="p7">When the king set eyes on the geese, he was delighted. He placed both the geese on a golden perch, gave them honey and fried grain to eat and sweetened water to drink, and holding his hands out in supplication prayed them to speak of the Dhamma. The king of the geese seeing how eager he was to hear first addressed him in pleasant words. These are the verses expressing the conversation of king and goose one with another.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;Now has his honor, health and wealth, and is the kingdom full</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of welfare and prosperity, and does he justly rule?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.428}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;O here is health and wealth, O goose, and here&rsquo;s a kingdom full</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of welfare and prosperity, with just and righteous rule.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;Is there no blemish seen amid your court, and are your foes</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;There is no blemish seen amid my courtiers, and my foes</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11669"></a><span class="t12">Far off are like the shadow on the south, which never grows.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. &ldquo;And is your queen of equal birth, obedient, sweet of speech,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fruitful, fair, famous, waiting on your wishes, doing each?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. &ldquo;O yes, my queen&rsquo;s of equal birth, obedient, sweet of speech,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fruitful, fair, famous, waiting on my wishes, doing each.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. &ldquo;O fostering ruler! Have you sons a many, nobly bred,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Quickwitted, easy men to please whatever thing be sped?&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [4.267]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. &ldquo;O Dhataraṭṭha! Sons I have of fame, five score and one:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell them their duty: they&rsquo;ll not leave your good advice undone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, the Great Being gave them admonition in five verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;He that puts off until too late the effort to do good,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though nobly bred, with virtue dowered, yet sinks beneath the flood. </span><span class="t18">{4.429}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11670"></a><span class="t12">23. His knowledge fades, great loss is his; as one moonblind at night</span><a id="a11671"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16476"><span class="t19">{1070}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sees all things swollen twice their size with his imperfect sight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. Who sees the truth in falsity no wisdom gains at all,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As on a rugged mountain-path the deer will often fall.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. If any strong courageous man loves virtue, follows right,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though but a low-born churl, he burns like bonfires in the night.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. By using this similitude all wisdom&rsquo;s truths explain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cherish your sons till wise they grow, like seedlings in the rain.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.430}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being discourse to the king the livelong night. The queen&rsquo;s craving was appeased. By sunrise he established him in the virtues of kings, and exhorted him to be vigilant, then with Sumukha flew out of the northern window and away to Cittakūṭa.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After this discourse, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Thus, monks, this man offered his life for me before,&rdquo; and then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Channa was the huntsman, Sāriputta the king, a sister was queen Khemā, the Sākiya tribe was the flock of geese, Ānanda was Sumukha, and I was the goose king myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Devadatta throws a stone and injures the Buddha, and the monks talk about how those who associate with him also become bad. The Buddha tells a story of two parrots, born of the same mother, one of which was raised by thieves and the other by sages, and the different characters they displayed because of it.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the parrot Pupphaka (Pupphakasuva),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;With a great host.&rdquo;</span><a id="a11682"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while sojourning in the deer-park Maddakucchi, about Devadatta. When Devadatta threw the stone, and a fragment pierced the Fortunate One&rsquo;s foot, there was great pain because of it. Numbers of the monks gathered to see the Tathāgata. Now when the Fortunate One saw the people gathered together, he said to them, &ldquo;Monks, this place is crowded: there will be a great gathering. Come now, carry me in </span><span class="t18">[4.268] </span><a id="a11683"></a><span class="t30">a litter to Maddakucchi.&rdquo; So then the monks did. Jīvaka made the Tathāgata&rsquo;s foot well. The monks sitting before the Teacher talked of it, &ldquo;Sirs, Devadatta is wicked and wicked are all his people; the wicked keeps company with the wicked.&rdquo; The Teacher asked, &ldquo;What do you talk of, monks?&rdquo; They told him. Said he, &ldquo;It has been so before, and this is not the first time the wicked Devadatta has kept wicked company.&rdquo; Then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past a king named Pañcāla reigned in the city of Uttarapañcāla. The Great Being was born as the son of the king of the parrots, in a grove of silk-cotton trees which grew on a high table-land in the heart of a forest: there were two brothers. Up wind from this hill was a robber village, where five hundred robbers dwelt: under its lee was a hermitage with five hundred sages.</p>
<p class="p7">About the time when the parrots were moulting came a whirlwind that carried off one of the parrots, <span class="t18">{4.431}</span> and he fell in the robber village among the robbers&rsquo; weapons: and because he fell there, they called him Sattigumba, or Bristling Spears. The other parrot fell in the hermitage, among the flowers which grew on a sandy spot, from which cause he was named Pupphaka, the Flower-bird. Sattigumba grew up amongst the robbers, Pupphaka with the sages.</p>
<p class="p7">One day the king in brave array, at the head of a great company, drove out in his splendid chariot to hunt the deer. Not far from the city, he entered a grove beautiful with a rich crop of flowers and fruit. He said: &ldquo;If any one lets a deer go by him, he shall answer it!&rdquo; Then he descended from the chariot, and took cover, standing, bow in hand in the hut assigned him. The beaters beat the bushes to put up the game. An antelope rose and looked for a way; he saw a gap by the king, got through it, and away. Everyone asked who had let the deer go past. It was the king! Hearing this they went and made fun of him.</p>
<p class="p7">The king in his self-conceit could not stomach the sport. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll catch that deer!&rdquo; cried he, and up into his chariot. &ldquo;Full speed!&rdquo; he said to the charioteer, and away he went after the deer. So quick went the king, that the others could not keep up with him: king and charioteer, these two alone, went on till midday, but saw no deer. The king then turned back; and seeing near the robber village a delightful glen, he alighted, bathed and drank, and came up from the water. Then the charioteer brought out a rug from the chariot, and spread it beneath the shade of a tree; the king lay on it, the charioteer sat at his feet massaging them: the king now dozed, now woke. The people of the robber village, all the robbers even, had gone forth into the woods to attend the king: thus in the village no one was left but Sattigumba and the cook, a man named Patikolamba. At that moment Sattigumba coming out of <span class="t18">[4.269] </span>the village, and seeing the king, thought: &ldquo;What if we kill that fellow as he sleeps, and take his ornaments!&rdquo; So he returned to Patikolamba, and told him all about it.<span class="t18"> {4.432}</span></p>
<p class="p7">To explain this the Teacher recited five verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;With a great host Pañcāla&rsquo;s king went out to hunt the deer;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Deep in the woods the monarch strayed, and not a soul was near.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Lo, he beholds within the wood a shelter thieves had made,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Out came a Parrot and forthwith these cruel words he said:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &lsquo;A young man riding in a car, with jewels many a one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And on his brow a golden crown shines ruddy like the sun!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Both king and driver lie asleep there in the high midday:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come, let us spoil them of their wealth and take it quick away!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &rsquo;Tis quiet as the deep midnight: both king and driver sleep:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their wealth and jewels let us take and keep,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kill them, and pile boughs on them in a heap.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus addressed, the man went out and looked, and seeing that it was a king, he was frightened, and recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Why, Sattigumba, are you mad? What words are these I hear?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kings are like blazing bonfires, and most perilous to come near.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The bird answered in another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Fool&rsquo;s talk, Patikolamba, this; and you are mad, not I:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11684"></a><span class="t12">My mother&rsquo;s naked; why condemn the calling we live by?&rdquo;</span><a id="a11685"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16479"><span class="t19">{1071}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{4.433}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now the king awoke, and hearing them talk together in the language of men, perceiving the danger, he recited the following verse to arouse his charioteer:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Up with you quick, friend charioteer, and yoke the chariot:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seek we another shelter, since this parrot I like not.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">He rose quickly, and put to the team, then recited a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;The car is yoked, O mighty king, is yoked and ready there:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Step in, O king! And let us go and seek shelter elsewhere.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">No sooner was he inside, than away flew the thoroughbreds swift as the wind. When Sattigumba saw the chariot departing, overwhelmed with excitement he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Now where are all the fellows gone that used to haunt this spot?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Away Pañcāla flies, let go because they saw him not.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. Shall he get clear away with life? Take javelin, spear, and bow:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Away Pañcāla flies, behold! O do not let him go!&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [4.270]</span></p>
<p class="p6">So he raved, fluttering to and fro: meanwhile in due course the king came to the hermitage of the sages. At that time the sages were all gone gathering fruits and roots, <span class="t18">{4.434}</span><a id="a11686"></a> and only the parrot Puppha<a id="a11687"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16481"><span class="t9">{1072}</span></a> was left in the hermitage. When he saw the king, he went to meet him, and addressed him courteously.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the Teacher recited four verses to explain:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;The parrot with his ruddy beak right courteously did say,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Welcome, O king! A happy chance directed you this way!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mighty you are and glorious: what errand brings you, pray?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11688"></a><span class="t12">13. The tindook and the piyal leaves, and kāsumārī sweet,</span><a id="a11689"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16483"><span class="t19">{1073}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though few and little, take the best we have, O king, and eat.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. And this cool water, from a cave high hidden on a hill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O mighty monarch, take of it, drink if it be your will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. All gleaning in the wood are they who here are wont to live:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Arise, O king, thyself and take: I have no hands to give.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king pleased at this courteous address, answered with a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;No better fowl was ever hatched; a very righteous bird:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But the other parrot over there said many a cruel word.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. O let him not go hence alive, O come and slay or bind!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He cried: I sought this hermitage, and safety here I find.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus addressed by the king, Pupphaka uttered two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. &ldquo;Brothers we are, O mighty king, of one self mother bred,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Reared both together in one tree, in different pastures fed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. Sattigumba to the thieves, I to the sages came;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Those bad, these good, and hence it comes our ways are not the same.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.435}</span></p>
<p class="p6">He then explained the differences in detail, repeating a pair of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. &ldquo;There wounds and bonds and trickery, cheating and shabby turns,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Raiding, and deeds of violence: such is the lore he learns.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. Here self-control, sobriety, kindness, the right and true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Shelter and drink for strangers: these were round me as I grew.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Next he declared the Dhamma to the king in the following verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;To whomsoever, good or bad, a man shall honour pay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vicious or virtuous, that man holds him beneath his sway.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. Like as the comrade one admires, like as the chosen friend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Such will become the man who keeps beside him, in the end.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. Friendship makes like, and touch by touch infects, you&rsquo;ll find it true:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Poison the arrow, and before long the quiver&rsquo;s poisoned too.</span><span class="t18"> [4.271]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. The wise eschews bad company, for fear of staining touch:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wrap rotten fish in grass, you&rsquo;ll find the grass stinks just as much.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And they who keep fool&rsquo;s company themselves will soon be such. </span><span class="t18">{4.436}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. Sweet frankincense wrap in a leaf, the leaf will smell as sweet.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So they themselves will soon grow wise, that sit at wise men&rsquo;s feet.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. By this similitude the wise should his own profit know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let him eschew bad company and with the righteous go:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Heaven waits the righteous, but the bad are doomed to hell below.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king was pleased with this exposition. Then the sages returned also. The king greeted the sages, saying: &ldquo;Be gracious, sirs, come and take up your abode in my grounds,&rdquo; and prevailed on them to accept the invitation. When he got home again, he proclaimed immunity for all parrots. The sages came there too and visited him. And the king gave them his park to live in, and took care of them so long as he lived. When he went to swell the hosts of heaven, his son had the royal umbrella raised over him, and he also took care of the sages, and so it went on from father to son through seven generations of kings all bounteous in alms. And the Great Being dwelt in the woods, until he passed away and traveled on according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this lesson was ended, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Thus, monks, you see that Devadatta kept bad company before, as he now does.&rdquo; Then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time, Devadatta was Sattigumba, </span><span class="t18">{4.437}</span><span class="t30"> his followers were the robbers, Ānanda was the king, the Buddha&rsquo;s followers were the sages, and I myself was parrot Pupphaka.&rdquo;</span></p>

The king was angry and would not look at her. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;the Tathāgata does not know that the king is angry with me.&rdquo; When the Teacher learned of it, next day, he sought alms in Benares, accompanied by the monks, and then repaired to the gate of the king&rsquo;s palace. The king came to meet him, and relieved him of his bowl, took him up on the terrace, set the monks </span><span class="t18">[4.272] </span><span class="t30">down in due order, gave them the water of welcome, offered them excellent food; after the meal he sat down on one side. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asked the Teacher, &ldquo;does not Mallikā appear?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis her own foolish pride in her prosperity.&rdquo; The Teacher said: &ldquo;O great king! Long, long ago when you were a Kinnara, you kept apart for one night from your mate, and then went mourning for seven hundred years.&rdquo; Then at his request, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, a king named Bhallāṭiya reigned in Benares. Seized with a desire to eat venison broiled on charcoal, he gave the kingdom in charge to his courtiers, girt himself with the five weapons, and with a well-trained pack of clever pedigree hounds he issued forth from the city and went to the Himālayas. He travelled along the Ganges until he could get no higher, then followed a tributary stream for some distance, killing deer and pig, and eating the flesh broiled, until he had climbed to a great height. There when the pleasant stream ran full, the water was breast-high, but at other times, it was no more than knee-deep. At that time there were fish and turtles of all sorts gambolling, sand at the water&rsquo;s edge like silver, trees on both banks bending beneath a load of flowers and fruit, many a bird and bee well drunken with the juice of fruit and honey of flowers flitted about in the shade, whither herds of all manner of deer did frequent. Now on the bank of this beautiful mountain stream <span class="t18">{4.438}</span><a id="a11702"></a> two Kinnaras fondly embraced and kissed one another, then fell a weeping and wailing most pitifully.</p>
<p class="p7">As the king climbed Mount Gandhamādana by way of this river bank, he espied these two Kinnaras. &ldquo;What can they be weeping about in this manner?&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;I will question them.&rdquo; A glance to his hounds, a snap of the fingers, and at this sign the thoroughbred dogs, which knew their work well, crept into the underwood and crouched down on their bellies. As soon as he saw they were out of the way, he laid down his bow and quiver and other weapons by a tree that stood near, and without letting his footsteps be heard stole gently up to the Kinnaras, and asked them, &ldquo;Why do you weep?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher repeated three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Was a king Bhallāṭiyo</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And out hunting he would go;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Climbs the Fragrant Mount, and finds it</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11703"></a><span class="t12">Full of Kimpurisas and flowers that blow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Straight he quiets every hound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lays bow and quiver on the ground,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Forward steps, to ask a question</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where a pair of Kimpurisas were found.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &lsquo;Winter&rsquo;s gone: then why return</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To talk and talk beside the burn?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O you human-seeming creatures,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What men call you I would learn.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [4.273]</span></p>
<p class="p6">To the king&rsquo;s question, the Kinnara said nothing; but his mate answered as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11704"></a><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Malla, Three-peak, Yellow Hill</span><a id="a11705"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16487"><span class="t19">{1075}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We traverse, following each cool rill.</span><span class="t18"> {4.439}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Human-like the wild things deem us:</span></p>

<p class="p6">Then the king recited three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Though like lovers you caress</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You weep as full of deep distress.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O you human-seeming creatures,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why this weeping? Come, confess!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Though like lovers you caress</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You weep as full of deep distress.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O you human-seeming creatures,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why this sorrowing? Come, confess!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Though like lovers you caress</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You weep as full of deep distress.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O you human-seeming creatures,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why this mourning? Come, confess!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The verses which follow were said by each in course of address and answer:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;We apart one night had lain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Both loveless, full of bitter pain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thinking each of each: but never</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Will that night come back again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;Why then spend that night alone</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which cost you many a sigh and groan,</span><span class="t18"> {4.440}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O you human-seeing creatures &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Money lost? A father gone?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Shaded thick that river flows</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. Flowers next and leaves I found,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And strewed them thickly on the ground,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where the livelong night together</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We might slumber soft and sound.</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. There we stood on either shore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Each on other gazing o&rsquo;er.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How we laughed and cried together!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ah! That night we suffered sore.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. Morning came, the sun was high</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And soon we saw the river dry.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then we crossed, and close embracing</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Both at once we laugh and cry.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. Seven hundred years but three</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Since we were parted, I and he.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When two loving hearts are severed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seems a whole long life to be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. &ldquo;What the limit of your years?</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or the teaching of the elders,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell it me, and have no fears.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To the end love&rsquo;s joys prevail.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.442}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king thought as he listened, &ldquo;These creatures, who are less than human, go weeping for seven hundred years for one night&rsquo;s parting: and here am I, lord of a realm of three hundred leagues, leaving all my magnificence and wandering about the forest. It is a great mistake.&rdquo; He returned immediately. Arrived at Benares, the courtiers asked him whether he had seen any marvellous thing in the Himālayas. <span class="t18">{4.443}</span> He told them the whole story, and thenceforward gave alms and enjoyed his wealth. <span class="t18">[4.275]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this matter, the Teacher repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;Thus instructed by the fays</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The king returned upon his ways,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ceased to hunt, and fed the needy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And enjoyed the fleeting days.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Two more verses he added:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. &ldquo;Take a lesson from the fays:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And quarrel not, but mend your ways.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lest you suffer, like Kimpurisas,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your own error all your days.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. Take a lesson from the fays:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And bicker not, but mend your ways.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lest you suffer, like Kimpurisas,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your own error all your days.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now rose the lady Mallikā from her couch, when she heard the Tathāgata&rsquo;s admonition, and joining hands she made reverent obeisance, while she repeated the last verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. &ldquo;Holy man, with willing mind</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I hear your words so good and kind.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All my sorrow&rsquo;s left behind.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.444}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Ever afterwards the king of Kosala lived with her in harmony.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This discourse ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the king of Kosala was the Kinnara, lady Mallikā was his mate, and I myself was king Bhallāṭiya.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Who does you harm.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about how Devadatta went about to slay him. Then the Teacher said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that Devadatta has sought to slay me, but he did the same thing before.&rdquo; Then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, in the kingdom of Kuru and the city of Uttarapañcāla, a king reigned whose name was Reṇu. At that time there was an ascetic Mahārakkhita, who dwelt in the Himālayas with a company of five hundred other ascetics. While visiting the country to get salt and <span class="t18">[4.276] </span>seasoning, he came to Uttarapañcāla, and then lived in the royal park. Seeking alms with his people, he came to the king&rsquo;s door, and the king beholding the sages and being pleased with their manners, invited them to be seated upon a magnificent dais, and gave them good food to eat. He then asked them to remain in his park for the rainy season. He accompanied them into the park, and provided places to dwell in, gave them the things necessary for the ascetic life, and took leave of them. After that they all received their meals in the palace.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the king was childless, and desired sons, but no sons were born to him.</p>
<p class="p7">When the rainy season was over, Mahārakkhita said: &ldquo;Now the Himālayas region is pleasant; let us return there.&rdquo; Then he took leave of the king, who showed them all honour and bounty, and departed. On the journey at noontide he left the high road, and with his people sat down on the soft grass beneath a shady tree. The ascetics began to talk. &ldquo;There is no son,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;in the palace to keep up the royal line. It would be a blessing if the king could get a son, and continue the succession.&rdquo; Mahārakkhita hearing their talk, pondered: <span class="t18">{4.445}</span> &ldquo;Will the king have a son, or no?&rdquo; He perceived that the king would have a son, and said: &ldquo;Do not be anxious, sirs; this night at dawn a Devaputta will come down, and will be conceived by the queen consort.&rdquo; A sham ascetic heard it, and thought: &ldquo;Now I will become a confidant of the royal house.&rdquo; When the time came for the ascetics to leave, he lay down and made as though he were sick. &ldquo;Come, let us go,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; said he. Mahārakkhita learned why the man lay down. &ldquo;Follow us when you can,&rdquo; he said, and with the rest of the sages went on to the Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the cheat ran back as fast as he could, and standing at the palace door, sent in a message that one of Mahārakkhita&rsquo;s attendants was come. He was summoned at once by the king, and going up to the terrace, sat in a seat which they showed him. The king greeted him, and sitting on one side, asked after the health of the sages. &ldquo;You have come back very soon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is the cause of your so speedy return?&rdquo; &ldquo;O mighty king,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;as the sages were all sitting comfortably together, they began to say how great a blessing it would be if the king could have a son to keep up his line. When I heard it, I pondered whether the king should get a son or no; and by divine vision I beheld a mighty Devaputta, and saw that he was about to descend, that he might be conceived by your queen consort Sudhammā. Then I thought, &lsquo;If they know not, they may perchance destroy the life conceived,&rsquo; so I must tell them; and to tell you the news, O king, I am come. Now I have told it, let me depart again.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no, friend,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;that must not be,&rdquo; and highly delighted he brought the cheat into his park, and assigned him a place to dwell in. Thenceforward he lived in the king&rsquo;s household, and got his food there, and his name was Dibbacakkhuka, the man of Divine Vision. <span class="t18">[4.277]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Then the Bodhisatta came down from the heaven of the Thirty-Three, and was conceived there; and when he was born they gave him the name of Somanassakumāra, prince Joy, and he was reared after the manner of princes.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the false ascetic in a corner of the park used to plant vegetables and pot-herbs and runners, and by selling these to the market gardeners he amassed much wealth. When the Bodhisatta was seven years old, <span class="t18">{4.446}</span> there was a rebellion on the frontier. The king went out to quell it, giving the ascetic Dibbacakkhuka into the prince&rsquo;s charge, with orders not to neglect him. One day the prince went out to see the ascetic. He found him with both yellow robes, upper and under, knotted up, holding a water jar in each hand, and watering his plants. &ldquo;This false ascetic,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;instead of doing the ascetic&rsquo;s duty, does the work of a gardener.&rdquo; Then he asked, &ldquo;What are you doing, worldling gardener?&rdquo; So he put him to shame, and left him without salute. &ldquo;Now I have made an enemy of this fellow,&rdquo; thought the man. &ldquo;Who knows what he will do? I must make an end of him at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">About the time when the king was to return, the man threw his stone bench on one side, broke his waterpot to bits, scattered grass about in his hut, smeared all his body with oil, went into the hut and lay down on his pallet, wrapped up head and all, making as though he were in much pain. The king returned, and made a circuit about the city right-wise. But before he would enter his own house, he went to see his friend Dibbacakkhuka. Standing by the door of the hut, he saw all in disorder, and entered wondering what was the matter. There was the man lying down. The king massaged his feet, repeating the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Who does you harm or scorn?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why do you sorrow sore?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whose parents now must mourn?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who lies here on the floor?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">At this the impostor rose up groaning, and said the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;You I rejoice to see</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O king, though absent long! </span><span class="t18">{4.447}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your son, who came to me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wrought unprovoked this wrong.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The connection of the following verses is clear; they are arranged in due succession.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Executioners, what ho!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Servants, take your swords and go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Strike prince Somanassa dead,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hither bring his noble head!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. The royal messengers went forth, and to the prince they cry &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ldquo;His majesty has cast you off; and you O prince must die!&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [4.278]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. There the prince lamenting stands,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Craving grace with folded hands:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ldquo;Spare me yet awhile, and bring</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Me alive to see the king!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. They heard his prayer, and to the king his son the servants led.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He saw his father from afar, and thus to him he said:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Let your men take sword and slay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Only hear me first, I pray!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O great monarch! Tell me this:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What is it I&rsquo;ve done amiss?&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.448}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king answered, &ldquo;High estate is fallen very low, your error is very great,&rdquo; and explained it in this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Water morn and eve he draws,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tends the fire without a pause.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dare you call this holy man</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Worldling? Answer if you can!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;if I call a worldling a worldling, what harm is done!&rdquo; and he repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;He possesses trees and fruits,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And, my lord, all kinds of roots,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tends them with incessant care,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then he&rsquo;s worldly, I declare.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;And that is the reason,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;why I called him a worldling. If you do not believe me, enquire of the market gardeners at the four gates.&rdquo; The king made enquiry. <span class="t18">{4.449}</span> They said: &ldquo;Yes, we buy from him vegetables and all sorts of fruit.&rdquo; When he found out this greengrocery business, he made it known. The prince&rsquo;s people went into the man&rsquo;s hut, and ferreted out a bundle of rupees and small coins, the price of the green food, which they showed to the king. Then the king knew the Great Being was guiltless, and said a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;True it was that trees and roots</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He possessed, with many fruits,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tending with incessant care,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Worldling, as you did declare.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being thought: &ldquo;While an ignorant fool like this is of the king&rsquo;s household, the best thing to do is to go to the Himālayas and embrace the ascetic life. First I will proclaim his wrongdoing before the company here assembled, and then this very day I will go and become an ascetic.&rdquo; So with a bow to the company, he cried,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;Hear you people as I call,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Country folk and townsmen all:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By this fool&rsquo;s advice the king</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Guiltless men to death would bring.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.279]</span></p>
<p class="p6">This said, he asked leave to do it in the next verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;You a strong wide spreading tree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I an offshoot fixed in you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here beseech you, bending low,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Leave to quit the world and go!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.450}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The following verses give the conversation of the king with his son.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;Prince, enjoy the wealth you own,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And ascend the Kuru throne.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do not leave the world, to bring</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sorrow on yourself &ndash; be king!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;What of joy can this world give?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When in heaven I used to live</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There were sights and sounds and smell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11720"></a><span class="t12">Taste and touch,</span><a id="a11721"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16495"><span class="t19">{1079}</span></a><span class="t12"> the heart loves well!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. Joys of heaven, </span><span class="t12">Accharā</span><span class="t12"> divine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I renounced, that once were mine.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With a king so weak as you</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I will stay no longer now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;If I am foolish-weak, my son,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This once forgive me what I&rsquo;ve done.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And if I do the same again,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do what you will, I&rsquo;ll not complain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being then repeated eight verses, admonishing the king. <span class="t18">{4.451}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;A thoughtless act, or done without premeditation had,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like the miscarriage of a drug, the issue must be bad.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. A thoughtful act, wherein is careful policy pursued,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like a successful medicine, the issue must be good.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. The idle sensual layman I detest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The false ascetic is a rogue contest;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A bad king will a case unheard decide;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11722"></a><span class="t12">Wrath in a sage can ne&rsquo;er be justified.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. The warrior prince takes careful thought, and well-weighed judgement gives:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11723"></a><span class="t12">When kings their judgement ponder well, their fame for ever lives.</span><a id="a11724"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16497"><span class="t19">{1080}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. Kings should give punishment with careful measure:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Things done in haste they will repent at leisure.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Are there good resolutions in the heart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No late repentance brings her bitter smart.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. They who do deeds which no repentance bring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Carefully weighing every single thing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gain what is good, and do what satisfies</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The holy, win the approval of the wise.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. What ho, my executioners! You cried,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Go seek my son, and where you find him, slay!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where I was sitting by my mother&rsquo;s side</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They found me, dragged me cruelly away.</span><span class="t18"> [4.280]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. A tender nursling, treated in this way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I felt their cruel handling very sore.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Delivered from a cruel doom today</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ll leave the world, and live in it no more.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.452}</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the Great Being had thus discoursed, the king said to his queen,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. &ldquo;So my young son, Sudhammā, says me nay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Prince Somanassa, delicate and kind.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now since I cannot gain my end today,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thyself must see if you can turn his mind.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But she urged him to renounce the world in this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. &ldquo;O be the holy life your pleasure, son!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Renounce the world, to righteousness stick fast:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who of all creatures cruel is to none,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Blameless to the Brahmā Realm will come at last.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the king repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. &ldquo;This is a marvel which I hear from you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sorrow to sorrow heaping up on me. </span><span class="t18">{4.453}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I asked you to persuade our son to stay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You do but urge him more to haste away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Again the queen repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">28. &ldquo;There are who live from wrong and sorrow free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Blameless, and who Nibbāna&rsquo;s height attain:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If of their noble path the prince would be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A partner, to withhold him is in vain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">In reply the king recited the last verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">29. &ldquo;Surely &rsquo;tis good to venerate the wise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11725"></a><span class="t12">In whom deep wisdom and high thoughts arise.</span><a id="a11726"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16499"><span class="t19">{1081}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The queen has heard their words and learned their lore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She feels no pain and has no longing more.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11727"></a>The Great Being then saluted his parents, asking them to pardon him if he did amiss, and with a reverent obeisance to the company set his face towards the Himālayas. When the people had returned, he, with the deities who had come there in human shape, traversed the seven ranges of hills and arrived at the Himālayas. In a leaf-hut made by the heavenly architect Vissakamma he entered upon the ascetic life, and there he was waited upon by deities in the shape of a princely retinue until his sixteenth year. But the deceitful ascetic was set upon by the crowd and beaten to death. The Great Being cultivated the Absorptions, and became destined to Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm.<span class="t18"> {4.454}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This discourse ended, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Thus monks, he went about to slay me in former days, as now,&rdquo; and then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Devadatta was the impostor, Mahāmāyā was the mother, Sāriputta was Rakkhita, and I myself was prince Somanassa.&rdquo;</span></p>
