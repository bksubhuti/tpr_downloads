<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is going on a visit to the Buddha, and a ferryman who is angry with him ensures he gets a soaking. The Buddha tells a story of a ferryman who refused good advice and lost all he had.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the ascetic (tāpasa),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er be angry.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [3.151] {3.228}</span><a id="a9153"></a><a id="a9154"></a><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this tale while dwelling at Jetavana, about a ferryman. This man, they say, was foolish and ignorant: he knew not the qualities of the Three Jewels and of all excellent beings: he was hasty, rough and violent. A certain country monk, wishing to wait on the Buddha, came one evening to the ferry on the Aciravatī and said to the ferryman, &ldquo;Lay brother, I wish to cross, let me have your boat.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, it is too late, stay here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lay brother, I cannot stay here, take me across.&rdquo; The ferryman said angrily, &ldquo;Come then, ascetic,&rdquo; and took him into the boat: but he steered badly and made the boat ship water, so that the monk&rsquo;s robe was wet, and it was dark before he put him on the farther bank. When the monk reached the monastery, he could not wait on the Buddha that day. Next day he went to the Teacher, saluted and sat on one side. The Teacher gave greeting and asked when he had come. &ldquo;Yesterday.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then why do you not wait on me till today?&rdquo; When he heard his reason, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Not only now, but of old also that man was rough: and he annoyed wise men of old, as he did you.&rdquo; And when asked he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family. When he grew up, he was educated in all the arts at Taxila, <span class="t18">{3.229}</span> and became an ascetic. After living long on wild fruits in the Himālayas, he came to Benares for salt and vinegar: he stayed in the royal garden and next day went into the city to beg. The king saw him in the palace-yard and being pleased with his behaviour caused him to be brought in and fed: then he took a promise and made him dwell in the garden: and he came daily to pay respect. The Bodhisatta said to him, &ldquo;O great king, a king should rule his kingdom with righteousness, eschewing the four evil courses, being zealous and full <span class="t18">[3.152] </span>of patience and kindness and compassion,&rdquo; and with such daily exhortation he spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9155"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er be angry, prince of warriors; ne&rsquo;er be angry, lord of earth:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Anger ne&rsquo;er requite with anger: thus a king is worship-worth.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. In the village, in the forest, on the sea or on the shore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9156"></a><span class="t12">Ne&rsquo;er be angry, prince of warriors: &rsquo;tis my counsel evermore.&rdquo;</span><a id="a9157"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15580"><span class="t19">{638}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">So the Bodhisatta spoke these verses to the king every day. The king was pleased with him and offered him a village whose revenue was a hundred thousand pieces: but he refused. In this way the Bodhisatta lived for twelve years. Then he thought: &ldquo;I have stayed too long, I will take a journey through the country and return here,&rdquo; so without telling the king and only saying to the gardener, &ldquo;Friend, I weary, I will journey in the country and return, pray do you tell the king,&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.230}</span><a id="a9158"></a><a id="a9159"></a> he went away and came to a ferry on the Ganges. There a foolish ferryman named Avāriyapitā lived: he understood neither the merits of good men nor his own gain and loss: when folk would cross the Ganges, he first took them across and then asked for his fare; when they gave him none, he quarrelled with them, getting much abuse and blows but little gain, so blind a fool was he.</p>
<p class="p7">Concerning him, the Teacher after Fully Awakening spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;The father of Avāriya,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His boat&rsquo;s on Ganges wave:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He ferries first the folk across,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And then his fare he&rsquo;ll crave:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And that is why he earns but strife,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A thriftless, luckless, cheat!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9160"></a>The Bodhisatta came to this ferryman and said: &ldquo;Friend, take me to the other bank.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Ascetic, what fare will you pay me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, I will tell you how to increase your wealth, your welfare, and your virtue.&rdquo; The ferryman thought: &ldquo;He will certainly give me something,&rdquo; so he took him across and then said: &ldquo;Pay me the fare.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;Very well, friend,&rdquo; and so telling him first how to increase his wealth, he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9161"></a><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Ask your fare before the crossing, never on the further shore:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Different minds have folk you ferry, different after and before.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.231}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The ferryman thought: &ldquo;This will be only his admonition to me, now he will give me something else,&rdquo; but the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;Friend, you have there the way to increase wealth, now hear the way to increase welfare and virtue,&rdquo; so he spoke a verse of admonition:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;In the village, in the forest, on the sea, and on the shore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ne&rsquo;er be angry, my good boatman; &rsquo;tis my counsel evermore.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.153]</span></p>
<p class="p6">So having told him the way to increase welfare and virtue, he said: &ldquo;There you have the way to increase welfare, and the way to increase virtue.&rdquo; Then that stupid one, not reckoning his admonition as anything, said: &ldquo;Ascetic, is that what you give me as my fare?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, friend.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have no use for it, give me something else.&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, except that I have nothing else.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then why did you go on my boat?&rdquo; he said, and threw the ascetic down on the bank, sitting on his chest and striking his mouth.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher said: &ldquo;So you see that when the ascetic gave this admonition to the king he got the boon of a village, and when he gave the same admonition to a stupid ferryman he got a blow in the mouth: therefore when one gives this admonition it must be given to suitable people, not to unsuitable,&rdquo; and so after Fully Awakening he then spoke a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;For counsel good the king bestowed the revenue of a town:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The boatman for the same advice has knocked the giver down.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9162"></a>As the man was striking the ascetic, his wife came with his rice, and seeing the ascetic, she said: &ldquo;Husband, this is an ascetic of the king&rsquo;s court, do not strike him.&rdquo; He was angry, and saying: &ldquo;You forbid me to strike this false ascetic!&rdquo; he sprang up and struck her down. The plate of rice fell and broke, and the fruit of her womb miscarried. The people gathered round him and <span class="t18">{3.232}</span> crying, &ldquo;Murdering rascal!&rdquo; they bound him and brought him to the king. The king tried him and caused him to be punished.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher after Fully Awakening explaining the matter spoke the last verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;The rice was spilt, his wife was struck, child killed before its birth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To him, like fine gold to a beast, counsel was nothing worth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended his lesson, he declared the Truths: after the Truths the brother was established in the fruit of the First Path: and he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the ferryman was the ferryman of today, the king was Ānanda, the ascetic was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk gets his living in dishonest ways. When the Buddha finds out he tells a story of a false ascetic who was angry with an outcaste, and how he was taught appearances do not equal deeds.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Friend, be not angry.&rdquo;</span><a id="a9172"></a><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this tale at Jetavana, of a deceitful monk. The occasion of the story will appear in the Uddālajātaka [Ja 487].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about a dishonest monk. This man, even though dedicated to the dispensation that leads to safety, notwithstanding to gain life&rsquo;s necessaries fulfilled the threefold cheating practice [seeking requisites, seeking honour and hinting].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The monks brought to light all the evil parts in the man as they conversed together in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Such a one, monks, after he had dedicated himself to this dispensation which leads to safety, yet lives in deceit!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and would know what they talked of there. They told him. Said he, &ldquo;This is not now the first time; he was deceitful before,&rdquo; and so saying he told a story of the past.</span><span class="t35"> [3.154]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a far-famed teacher and taught the sacred texts to five hundred pupils. The senior of them, Setaketu by name, was born of a brahmin family from the north, and was very proud on account of his caste. One day he went out of the town with other pupils, and when coming in again he saw an <span class="t18">{3.233}</span> outcaste. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am an outcaste.&rdquo; He feared the wind after striking the outcaste&rsquo;s body might touch his own body, so he cried, &ldquo;Curse you, you ill-omened outcaste, get to leeward,&rdquo; and went quickly to windward, but the outcaste was too quick for him and stood to windward of him. Then he abused and reviled him the more, &ldquo;Curse you, ill-omened one.&rdquo; The outcaste asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am a brahmin student.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, if you are, you will be able to answer me a question.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t, I will put you between my feet.&rdquo; The brahmin, feeling confident, said: &ldquo;Proceed.&rdquo; The outcaste, making the company understand the case, asked the question, &ldquo;Young brahmin, what are the quarters?&rdquo; &ldquo;The quarters are four, the east and the rest.&rdquo; The outcaste said: &ldquo;I am not asking about that kind of quarter: and you, ignorant even of this, loathe wind that has struck my body,&rdquo; so he took him by the shoulder and forcing him down put him between his feet. The other pupils told their teacher of the affair. He asked, &ldquo;Young Setaketu, have you been put between an outcaste&rsquo;s feet?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, teacher: the son of a slave put me between his feet, saying, &lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t even know the quarters;&rsquo; but now I shall know what to do to him,&rdquo; and so he reviled the outcaste angrily. The teacher admonished him, &ldquo;Young Setaketu, be not angry with him, he is wise; he was asking about another kind of quarter, not this: what you have not seen, or heard, or understood is far more than what you have,&rdquo; and he spoke two verses by way of admonition:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9173"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Friend, be not angry, anger is not good:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wisdom is more than you have seen or heard: </span><span class="t18">{3.234}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By quarter parents may be understood,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And teacher is denoted by the word.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9174"></a><span class="t12">2. The householder who gives food, clothes and drink,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whose doors are open, he a quarter is:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And quarter in the highest sense, we think,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9175"></a><span class="t12">Is that last state where misery shall be bliss.&rdquo;</span><a id="a9176"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15582"><span class="t19">{639}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{3.235}</span></p>
<p class="p6">So the Bodhisatta explained the quarters to the young brahmin: but he thinking: &ldquo;I was put between an outcaste&rsquo;s feet,&rdquo; left that place and going to Taxila learned all the arts from a far-famed teacher. With that teacher&rsquo;s permission he left Taxila, and wandered learning all practical arts. Coming to a frontier village he found five hundred ascetics <span class="t18">[3.155] </span>dwelling near it and was ordained by them. All their arts, texts and practices he learned, and they accompanied him to Benares. Next day he went to the palace-yard begging. The king, pleased with the ascetics&rsquo; behaviour, gave them food in the palace and lodging in his garden. One day he said, sending them food, &ldquo;I will salute your reverences this evening in the garden.&rdquo; Setaketu went to the garden and collecting the ascetics, said: &ldquo;Sirs, the king is coming today; now by once conciliating kings a man may live happily all the years of his life, so now some of you do the swinging penance, some lie on thorn-beds, some endure the five fires, some practise the mortification by squatting, some the act of diving, some repeat texts,&rdquo; and after these orders he set himself at the door of the hut on a chair with a head-rest, put a book with a brilliant-coloured wrapping on a painted stand, and explained texts as they were inquired about by four or five intelligent pupils. At that moment the king arrived <span class="t18">{3.236}</span> and seeing them doing these false penances he was delighted, he came up to Setaketu, saluted him and sat on one side; then talking to his family priest he spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;With uncleansed teeth, and goatskin garb and hair</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All matted, muttering holy words in peace:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Surely no human means to good they spare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They know the Truth, and they have won Release.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The priest heard this and spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9177"></a><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;A learned sage may do ill deeds, O king:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A learned sage may fail to follow right:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A thousand Vedas will not safety bring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Failing just works, or save from evil plight.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the king heard this, he took away his favour from the ascetics. Setaketu thought: &ldquo;This king took a liking to the ascetics, but this priest has destroyed it as if he had cut it with an axe: I must talk to him,&rdquo; so talking to him he spoke the fifth verse: <span class="t18">{3.237}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;A learned sage may do ill deeds, O king:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A learned sage may fail to follow right</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You say: &lsquo;Then Vedas are a useless thing:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Just works with self-restraint are requisite.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The priest hearing this, spoke the sixth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Nay, Vedas are not useless utterly:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though works with self-restraint true Dhamma is:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Study of Vedas lifts man&rsquo;s name on high,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But &rsquo;tis by conduct that he reaches bliss.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So the priest refuted Setaketu&rsquo;s Dhamma. He made them all laymen, gave them shields and weapons, and appointed them to be attendants on the <span class="t18">[3.156] </span><a id="a9178"></a>king as Superior Officers: and hence they say comes the lineage of Superior<a id="a9179"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15584"><span class="t9">{640}</span></a> Officers.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Setaketu was the cheating monk, the outcaste was Sāriputta, and the king&rsquo;s priest was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h3 class="h30"><a id="ncx13763"></a><a id="a9180"></a><a id="a9181"></a><a id="a9182"></a><a id="a9183"></a><a id="a9184"></a>Ja 378 Darīmukhajātaka<br/>The Story about (the Paccekabuddha) Darīmukha (6s)</h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks talk about the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s Great Renunication. The Buddha tells a story in which he had previously renounced a kingdom owing to the instruction of his conatal, who had become a Paccekabuddha.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the king (of Benares) (rājā).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9185"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Renunciation, Friendship.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Pleasures of sense.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{3.238}</span><a id="a9186"></a><a id="a9187"></a><span class="t30"> This tale was told by the Teacher while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the Great Renunciation. The incident that led to the story has been told before.</span><a id="a9188"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15586"><span class="t9">{641}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">...the future Buddha, making light of the kingdom of the world, thus within his reach &ndash; casting it away as one would saliva &ndash; left the city with great honour on the full-moon day of Āsāḷhi, when the moon was in the Uttarāsāḷha lunar mansion (i.e. on the [last day of the lunar month in] July)..</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">For then, they say, Devas in front of him carried sixty thousand torches, and behind him too, and on his right hand, and on his left..</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Advancing in this pomp and glory, the Bodhisatta, in that one night, passed beyond three kingdoms, and arrived, at the end of thirty leagues, at the bank of the river called Anomā..</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now the Bodhisatta, stopping at the river side, asked Channa, &ldquo;What is this river called?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Its name, my lord, is Anomā.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;And so also our renunciation of the world shall be called Anomā (Illustrious),&rdquo; said he; and signalling to his horse, by pressing it with his heel, the horse sprang over the river, five or six hundred yards in breadth, and stood on the opposite bank.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Bodhisatta, getting down from the horse&rsquo;s back, stood on the sandy beach, extending there like a sheet of silver, and said to Channa, &ldquo;Good Channa, do you now go back, taking my ornaments and Kanthaka. I am going to become an ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;But I also, my lord, will become an ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;You cannot be allowed to renounce the world, you must go back,&rdquo; he said. Three times he refused this request of Channa&rsquo;s; and he delivered over to him both the ornaments and Kanthaka.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then he thought: &ldquo;These locks of mine are not suited for a mendicant. Now it is not right for any one else to cut the hair of a future Buddha, so I will cut them off myself with my sword.&rdquo; Then, taking his sword in his right hand, and holding the plaited tresses, together with the diadem on them, with his left, he cut them off. So his hair was thus reduced to two inches in length, and curling from the right, it lay close to his head. It remained that length as long as he lived, and the beard the same. There was no need at all to shave either hair or beard any more.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Bodhisatta, saying to himself, &ldquo;If I am to become a Buddha, let it stand in the air; if not, let it fall to the ground;&rdquo; threw the hair and diadem together as he held them towards the sky..</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Again the Bodhisatta thought: &ldquo;This my raiment of Benares muslin is not suitable for a mendicant.&rdquo; Now the Deva Ghaṭikāra, who had formerly been his friend in the time of Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, was led by his friendship, which had not grown old in that long interval, to think, &ldquo;Today my friend is accomplishing the Great Renunciation, I will go and provide him with the requisites of a mendicant.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">273. &ldquo;The three robes, and the alms bowl,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">Razor, needle, and girdle,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">And a water strainer &ndash; these eight</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">Are the wealth of the monk devout.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t34">Taking these eight requisites of a mendicant, he gave them to him. The Bodhisatta dressed himself in the outward signs of an Arahat, and adopted the sacred garb of Renunciation; and he enjoined upon Channa to go and, in his name, assure his parents of his safety. And Channa did homage to the Bodhisatta reverently, and departed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9189"></a>In the past the Magadha king reigned in Rājagaha. The Bodhisatta was born of his chief queen, and they called him prince Brahmadatta. On the day of his birth, the family priest also had a son: his face was very beautiful, so they called him Darīmukha.<a id="a9190"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15588"><span class="t9">{642}</span></a> Both grew up in the king&rsquo;s court dear friends together, and in the sixteenth year they went to Taxila and learned all the arts.</p>
<p class="p7">Then, meaning to acquire all practical usages and understand country observances, they wandered through towns, villages and all the land. So they reached Benares, and staying in a temple they went into the city next day for alms. In one of the houses in the city the people of the house had cooked rice-porridge and prepared seats to feed brahmins and give them portions. These people seeing the two youths begging, thought: &ldquo;The brahmins have come,&rdquo; and making them come in laid a white cloth on the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s seat and a red rug on Darīmukha&rsquo;s. Darīmukha observed the omen and understood that his friend should be king in Benares and himself commander of the army. They ate and took their portions, and then with a blessing left and went to the king&rsquo;s garden.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta lay on the royal stone-seat. Darīmukha sat stroking his feet. The king of Benares had been dead seven days. The family priest had performed funeral rites and sent out the <a id="a9191"></a><span class="t18">[3.157] </span>festal carriage for seven days as there was no heir to the throne. This ceremony of the carriage will be explained in the Mahājanakajātaka [Ja 539].<a id="a9192"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15590">{643}</a><a id="a9193"></a></p>
<p class="p7">This carriage left the city and reached the gate of the garden, <span class="t18">{3.239}</span><a id="a9194"></a> accompanied by an army of the four divisions and by the music of hundreds of instruments. Darīmukha, hearing the music, thought: &ldquo;This carriage is coming for my friend, he will be king today and give me the commander&rsquo;s place, but why should I be a layman? I will go away and become an ascetic,&rdquo; so without a word to the Bodhisatta he went on one side and stood concealed. The ascetic stayed the carriage at the gate of the garden, and entering saw the Bodhisatta lying on the royal seat: observing the auspicious marks on his feet, he thought: &ldquo;He has merit and is worthy to be king even of the four continents with two thousand islands around them, but what is his courage?&rdquo; So he made all the instruments sound their loudest. The Bodhisatta woke and taking the cloth from his face he saw the multitude: then covering his face again he lay down for a little, and rising when the carriage stopped sat cross-legged on the seat. The ascetic resting on his knee said: &ldquo;Lord, the kingdom falls to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, is there no heir?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then it is well,&rdquo; and so he accepted, and they anointed him there in the garden. In his great glory he forgot Darīmukha.</p>
<p class="p7">He mounted the carriage and drove amid the multitude in solemn form round the city: then stopping at the palace-gate he arranged the places of the courtiers and went up to the terrace. At that instant Darīmukha seeing the garden now empty came and sat on the royal seat in the garden. A withered leaf fell before him. In it he came to see the principles of decay and death, grasped the three marks of existence, and making the earth re-echo with joy he entered on Paccekabodhi<span class="t11">.</span> At that instant the characteristics of a householder vanished from him, a bowl and robes created by Supernormal Powers fell from the sky and clave to his body, at once he had the eight requisites and the perfect behaviour of a centenarian monk, <span class="t18">{3.240}</span><a id="a9195"></a> and by his Supernormal Powers he flew into the air and went to the cave Nandamūla<a id="a9196"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15592"><span class="t9">{644}</span></a> in the Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9197"></a>The Bodhisatta ruled his kingdom with righteousness, but the greatness of his glory infatuated him and for forty years he forgot Darīmukha. In the fortieth year he remembered him, and saying: &ldquo;I have a friend named Darīmukha; where is he now?&rdquo; he longed to see him. Thenceforth even in the harem and in the assembly he would say, &ldquo;Where is my friend Darīmukha? I will give great honour to the man who tells me of his abode.&rdquo; Another ten years passed while he remembered Darīmukha from time to time.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9198"></a>Darīmukha, though now a Paccekabuddha, after fifty years reflected and knew that his friend remembered him: and thinking: &ldquo;He is now old and increased with sons and daughters, I will go and preach the Dhamma to him and ordain him,&rdquo; he went by his Supernormal Powers through <span class="t18">[3.158] </span>the air, and lighting in the garden he sat like a golden image on the stone seat. The gardener seeing him came up and asked, &ldquo;Sir, whence come you?&rdquo; &ldquo;From the cave Nandamūlaka.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, I am Darīmukha the Pacceka.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, do you know our king?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, he was my friend in my layman days.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, the king longs to see you, I will tell him of your coming.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go and do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">He went and told the king that Darīmukha was come and sitting on the stone-seat. The king said: &ldquo;So my friend is come, I shall see him,&rdquo; so he mounted his carriage and with a great retinue went to the garden and saluting the Paccekabuddha with kindly greeting he sat on one side. The Paccekabuddha said: &ldquo;Brahmadatta, do you rule your kingdom with righteousness, never follow evil courses or oppress the people for money, and do good deeds with generosity?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.241}</span> and after kindly greeting him, he said: &ldquo;Brahmadatta, you are old, it is time for you to renounce pleasures, and be ordained,&rdquo; so he preached the Dhamma and spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9199"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Pleasures of sense are but morass and mire:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The triply-rooted terror them I call.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vapour and dust I have proclaimed them, sire:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Having gone forth you should forsake them all.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.242}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, the king explaining that he was bound by desires spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Infatuate, bound and deeply stained am I,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brahmin, with pleasures: fearful they may be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But I love life, and cannot them deny:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Good works I undertake continually.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.243}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Darīmukha, though the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;I cannot be ordained,&rdquo; did not reject him and exhorted him yet again:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;He who rejects the counsel of his friend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who pities him, and would avert his doom,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thinking this world is better, finds no end,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Foolish, of long rebirths within the womb.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. That fearful place of punishment is his,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Full of all filth, held evil by the good:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The greedy their desires can ne&rsquo;er dismiss,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The flesh imprisons all the carnal brood.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.244}</span></p>
<p class="p6">So Darīmukha the Paccekabuddha showing the misery rising from conception and sustenance, to show next the misery of birth spoke a verse and a half:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Covered with blood and with gross foulness stained,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All mortal beings issue from the birth:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whate&rsquo;er they touch thereafter is ordained</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To bring them pain and sorrow on the earth.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6a. I speak what I have seen, not what I hear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From others: I remember times of old.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.159] {3.245}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now the Teacher after Fully Awakening said: &ldquo;So the Paccekabuddha helped the king with good words,&rdquo; and at the end spoke the remaining half-verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9200"></a><span class="t12">6b. &ldquo;Darīmukha did to Sumedha&rsquo;s</span><a id="a9201"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15594"><span class="t19">{645}</span></a><span class="t12"> ear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wisdom in many a verse sweet unfold.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Paccekabuddha, showing the misery of desires, making his words understood, said: &ldquo;O king, be ordained or not, but anyhow I have told the wretchedness of desires and the blessings of ordination, be you zealous,&rdquo; and so like a golden royal goose he rose in the air, and treading on clouds he reached the Nandamūlaka cave. The Great Being made on his head the salutations resplendent with the ten finger-nails put together and bowing down stood till <span class="t18">{3.246}</span> Darīmukha passed out of sight: then he sent for his eldest son and gave him the kingdom: and leaving desires, while a great multitude was weeping and lamenting, he went to the Himālayas and building a hut of leaves he was ordained as an ascetic: then in no long time he gained the Super Knowledges and Attainments and at his life&rsquo;s end he went to Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The lesson ended, the Teacher declared the Truths: then many attained the First Path and the rest: and he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the king was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a9207"></a><span class="t15">In the present one virtuous monk goes to stay in a village, but the villagers abandon him for the sectarians. The Buddha tells a story of how two golden birds would not stay on Mount Neru which made all birds appear golden, as it made no discrimination in casting its lustre.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the elder goose (jeṭṭhakahaṁsa),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Ānanda = the younger goose (kaniṭṭhahaṁsa).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9208"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Discrimination, Animals, Birds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Ravens and crows.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this tale in Jetavana concerning a certain monk. The story is that he got instruction in meditation from the Teacher and then went to a frontier village. There the people, pleased with his behaviour, fed him, built him a hut in the wood, and exacting a promise, made him live there, and gave him great honour. But they forsook him for the teachers of the permanence of matter, afterwards forsaking those for the sect who deny immortality, and those again for the sect of naked ascetics: for teachers of all these sects came among them in turn. So he was unhappy </span><span class="t18">[3.160] </span><a id="a9209"></a><span class="t30">among those people who knew not good and evil, and after the rains and the Invitation</span><a id="a9210"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15596"><span class="t9">{646}</span></a><span class="t30"> he went back to the Teacher, and at his request told him where he had stayed during the Rains Retreat and that he had been unhappy among people who knew not good and evil. The Teacher said: &ldquo;Sages of old, even when born as beasts, stayed not a day among those who knew not good and evil, why have you done so?&rdquo; and so he told the tale.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as a golden goose. Along with his younger brother <span class="t18">{3.247}</span> he lived on the hill Cittakūṭa and fed on wild paddy in the Himālayas. One day in their flight back to Cittakūṭa they saw the golden mountain Neru and settled on its summit. Around the mountain dwell birds and beasts of various kinds for feeding ground: from the time of their coming to the mountain onwards they became golden of hue from its lustre. The Bodhisatta&rsquo;s brother saw this, but being ignorant of the cause said: &ldquo;Now what is the cause here?&rdquo; and so talking to his brother he spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9211"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Ravens and crows, and we the best of birds,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When on this mountain, all appear the same.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Mean jackals rival tigers and their lords,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The lions: what can be the mountain&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta hearing this spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9212"></a><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Noblest of Mountains, Neru is it hight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All animals are here made fair to sight.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The younger one hearing this spoke the remaining three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;er the good find honour small or none,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or less than others, live not, but begone.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. Dull and clever, brave and coward, all are honoured equally:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Undiscriminating mountain, good men will not stay on you! </span><span class="t18">{3.248}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Best, indifferent and meanest Neru does not separate,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Undiscriminating Neru, we, alas, must leave you straight.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">With this they both flew up and went to Cittakūṭa.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher proclaimed the Truths and identified the Jātaka, at the close of the Truths, that monk was established in the fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time the younger goose was Ānanda, the elder was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

The occasion will appear in the Indriyajātaka [Ja 423].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The story is that a young man of good family at Sāvatthi heard the Teacher&rsquo;s preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymen&rsquo;s houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. He took what he had got to the wife he had left: she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. &ldquo;Salute him and bid him pass on.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, &ldquo;This is the father of my sons.&rdquo; She came out and saluted him: taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food: when he had eaten she saluted again and said: &ldquo;Sir, you are a saint now: we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householder&rsquo;s life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country: be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.&rdquo; For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: &ldquo;I cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life; send a layman&rsquo;s garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.&rdquo; She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9221"></a><span class="t30">The Teacher found that the monk was discontent owing to thoughts of his wife, so he said: &ldquo;Sir, this woman does you harm: formerly also for her sake you sacrificed an army of the four divisions and dwelt in the Himālayas three years in much misery,&rdquo; so he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family at a village of that country. When he grew up, he learned the arts <a id="a9222"></a><span class="t18">{3.249}</span> at Taxila, became an ascetic and reaching the Super Knowledges and Attainments lived on roots and fruits in the Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time a being of perfect merit fell from the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and was conceived as a girl inside a lotus in a pool: and when the other lotuses grew old and fell, that one grew great and stood. The ascetic coming to bathe saw it and thought: &ldquo;The other lotuses fall, but this one is grown great and stands; why is this?&rdquo; So he put on his bathing-dress and crossed to it, then opening the lotus he saw the girl.</p>
<p class="p7">Feeling towards her as to a daughter he took her to his hut and tended her. When she came to sixteen years, she was beautiful, and in her beauty excelled the hue of man, but attained not the hue of gods. Sakka came to wait on the Bodhisatta. He saw the maiden, asked and was told the way in which she was found, and then asked, &ldquo;What ought she to receive?&rdquo; &ldquo;A dwelling-place and supply of raiment, ornament and food, O sir.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Very well, lord,&rdquo; and created a crystal palace for her dwelling, made for her a bed, raiment and ornament, food and drink divine. The palace descended and rested on the ground when she was going up; when she had gone up it ascended and stayed in the air. She did various services to the Bodhisatta as she lived in the palace. A forester saw this and asked, &ldquo;What is this person to you, lord?&rdquo; &ldquo;My daughter.&rdquo; So he went to Benares and told the king, &ldquo;O king, I have seen in the Himālayas a certain ascetic&rsquo;s daughter of such beauty.&rdquo; The king was caught by hearing this, and making the forester his guide he went with an army of the four divisions to that place, and pitching a camp he took the forester and his retinue of ministers and entered the hermitage. <span class="t18">{3.250}</span> He saluted the Bodhisatta and said: &ldquo;Lord, women are a stain to the ascetic life; I will tend your daughter.&rdquo;<span class="t18"> [3.162]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now the Bodhisatta had given the maiden the name Āsaṅkā because she was brought to him by his crossing the water owing to his doubt (āsaṅkā), &ldquo;What is in this lotus?&rdquo; He did not say to the king directly, &ldquo;Take her and go,&rdquo; but said: &ldquo;If you know this maiden&rsquo;s name, O great king, take her and go.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord, if you tell it, I shall know.&rdquo; &ldquo;I shall not tell it, but when you know it take her and depart.&rdquo; The king agreed, and thenceforth considered along with his ministers, &ldquo;What may be her name?&rdquo; He put forward all names hard to guess and talked with the Bodhisatta, saying: &ldquo;Such and such will be her name,&rdquo; but the Bodhisatta said nay and refused him.</p>
<p class="p7">So a year passed while the king was considering. Lions and other beasts seized his elephants and horses and men, there was danger from snakes, danger from flies, and many died worn out with cold. The king said to the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;What need have I of her?&rdquo; and took his way. The maiden Āsaṅkā stood at an open crystal window. The king seeing her said: &ldquo;We cannot find your name, live here in the Himālayas, we will depart.&rdquo; &ldquo;Great king, if you go you will never find a wife like me. In the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, in the Cittalatā garden, there is a creeper named Āsāvatī: in its fruit a divine drink is born, and they who drink of it once are intoxicated for four months and lie on a divine couch: it bears fruit once in a thousand years and the Devaputtas, though given to strong drink, <span class="t18">{3.251}</span> bear with their thirst for that divine drink saying: &ldquo;We shall reap fruit from this,&rdquo; and come constantly throughout the thousand years to watch the plant saying: &ldquo;Is it well?&rdquo; But you grow discontented in one year: he who wins the fruit of his hope is happy, be not discontented yet,&rdquo; and so she spoke three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9223"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;In heavenly garden grows Āsāvatī;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Once in a thousand years, no more, the tree</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bears fruit: for it the gods wait patiently.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Hope on, O king, the fruit of hope is sweet:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A bird hoped on and never own&rsquo;d defeat.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. His wish, though far away, he won complete:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hope on, O king: the fruit of hope is sweet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king was caught by her words: he gathered his ministers again and guessed at the name, making ten guesses each time till another year was past. But her name was not among the ten, and so the Bodhisatta refused him. Again the king said: &ldquo;What need have I of her?&rdquo; and took his way.</p>
<p class="p7">She showed herself at the window, and the king said: &ldquo;You stay, we will depart.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.252}</span> &ldquo;Why depart, great king?&rdquo; &ldquo;I cannot find your name.&rdquo; &ldquo;Great king, why can you not find it? Hope is not without success; a crane staying on a hill-top won his wish: why can you not win it? Endure, great king. A crane had its feeding-ground in a lotus-pool, but flying up lit on a hill-top: he stayed there that day and next day thought: &ldquo;I am happily settled on this hill-top: if without going down I stay here finding food and drinking water and so dwell this day, Oh, it <span class="t18">[3.163] </span>would be delightful.&rdquo; That very day Sakka, king of heaven, had crushed the Asuras and being now lord in the heaven of the Thirty-Three was thinking: &ldquo;My wishes have come to the pitch of fulfilment, is there any one in the forest whose wishes are unfulfilled?&rdquo; So considering, he saw that crane and thought: &ldquo;I will bring this bird&rsquo;s wishes to the pitch of fulfilment,&rdquo; not far from the crane&rsquo;s place of perch there is a stream, and Sakka sent the stream in full flood to the hill-top: so the crane without moving ate fish and drank water and dwelt there that day; then the water fell and went away; so, great king, the crane won fruition of that hope of his, and why will you not win it? Hope on,&rdquo; she said, with the rest of the verse.</p>
<p class="p7">The king, hearing her tale, was caught by her beauty and attracted by her words: he could not go away, but gathering his ministers, and getting a hundred names <span class="t18">{3.253}</span> spent another year in guessing with these hundred names. At the end of three years he came to the Bodhisatta and asked, &ldquo;Will that name be among the hundred, lord?&rdquo; &ldquo;You do not know it, great king.&rdquo; He saluted the Bodhisatta, and saying: &ldquo;We will go now,&rdquo; he took his way. The maiden Āsaṅkā again stood by a crystal window. The king saw her and said: &ldquo;You stay, we will depart.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, great king?&rdquo; &ldquo;You satisfy me with words, but not with love: caught by your sweet words I have spent here three years, now I will depart,&rdquo; and he uttered these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9224"></a><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;You please me but with words and not in deed:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The scentless flower, though fair, is but a weed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. Promise fair without performance on his friends one throws away,</span></p>

His son, Migālopa by name, was exceedingly strong and mighty; he flew high above the reach of the other vultures. They told their king that his son flew very far. He called Migālopa, and saying: &ldquo;Son, they say you fly too high: if you do, you will bring death on yourself,&rdquo; spoke three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Your ways, my son, to me unsafe appear,</span></p>

<p class="p6">Migālopa through disobedience did not do his father&rsquo;s bidding, but rising and rising he passed the limit his father told him, clove even the Black Winds when he met them, and flew upwards till he met the Verambha winds in the face.

From the time when he was established in the fruition of the First Path he kept the Five Precepts unbroken; so also did his wife, his sons and daughters, his hired servants and his workers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day in the Dhamma Hall they began to discuss whether Anāthapiṇḍika was pure himself and his household also. The Teacher came and was told their subject: so he said: &ldquo;Monks, the wise men of old had pure households,&rdquo; and told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a merchant, giving gifts, keeping the commands, and performing the fast day duties: and so his wife kept the Five Precepts, and so also did his sons, his daughters and his servants and workers. So he was called the merchant Suciparivāra (Pure Household). He thought: &ldquo;If one of purer morals than I should come, it would not be proper to give him my couch to sit on or my bed to lie on, but to give him one pure and unused,&rdquo; so he had an unused couch and bed prepared on one side in his presence-chamber.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time in the Heaven of the Four Kings,<a id="a9246"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15600"><span class="t9">{648}</span></a><a id="a9247"></a> Kālakaṇṇī [Unlucky], daughter of Virūpakkha, and Sirī [Lucky], daughter of Dhataraṭṭha, both together took many perfumes and garlands and went on the Lake Anotatta to play there. Now on that lake there are many bathing places: <span class="t18">[3.166] </span>the Buddhas bathe at their own place, the Paccekabuddhas at theirs, <span class="t18">{3.258}</span><a id="a9248"></a> the monks at theirs, the ascetics at theirs, the Devaputtas of the six Kāma-heavens<a id="a9249"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15602"><span class="t9">{649}</span></a> at theirs, and the Devadhītā at theirs.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9250"></a>These two came there and began to quarrel as to which of them should bathe first. Kālakaṇṇī said: &ldquo;I rule the world: it is proper that I bathe first.&rdquo; Sirī said: &ldquo;I preside over the course of conduct that gives lordship to mankind: it is proper that I bathe first.&rdquo; Then both said: &ldquo;The Four Kings will know which of us ought to bathe first,&rdquo; so they went to them and asked which of the two was worthy to bathe first in Anotatta. Dhataraṭṭha and Virūpakkha said: &ldquo;We cannot decide,&rdquo; and laid the duty on Virūḷha and Vessavaṇa. They too said: &ldquo;We cannot decide, we will send it to our Lord&rsquo;s feet,&rdquo; so they sent it to Sakka. He heard their tale and thought: &ldquo;Those two are the daughters of my vassals; I cannot decide this case,&rdquo; so he said to them, &ldquo;There is in Benares a merchant called Suciparivāra; in his house are prepared an unused couch and bed: she who can first sit or lie there is the proper one to bathe first.&rdquo; Kālakaṇṇī hearing this on the instant put on blue<a id="a9251"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15604"><span class="t9">{650}</span></a> raiment and used blue ointment and decked herself with blue jewels: she descended from the heaven as on a stone from a catapult, and just after the mid-watch of night she stood in the air, diffusing a blue light, not far from the merchant who was lying on a couch in the presence-chamber of his mansion. The merchant <span class="t18">{3.259}</span> looked and saw her: but to his eyes she was ungracious and unlovely. Talking to her he spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9252"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Who is this so dark of hue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So unlovely to the view?</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How are we to know you, pray?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing him, Kālakaṇṇī spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;The great king Virūpakkha is my sire:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I am Unlucky, Kālakaṇṇī dire:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Give me the house-room near you I desire.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;What the conduct, what the ways,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of the men with whom you dwell</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This is what my question prays:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We will mark the answer well.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then she, explaining her own qualities, spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;The hypocrite, the wanton, the morose,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The man of envy, greed and treachery:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their gains that they may perish utterly.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.167] {3.260}</span></p>
<p class="p6">She spoke also the fifth, sixth, and seventh verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;And dearer still are ire and hate to me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Slander and strife, libel and cruelty.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Resenting counsel, to his betters rude:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He is my friend, in him my pleasure lies.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.261}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being, blaming her, spoke the eighth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Kāli, depart: there&rsquo;s naught to please you here:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To other lands and cities disappear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Kālakaṇṇī, hearing him, was sorrowful and spoke another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;I know you well: there&rsquo;s naught to please me here.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Others are luckless, who amass much gear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My brother-god and I will make it disappear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When she had gone, Sirī the Devadhītā, coming with raiment and ointment of golden hue and ornament of golden brightness to the door of the presence-chamber, diffusing yellow light, rested with even feet on level ground and stood respectful. The Bodhisatta seeing her repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Who is this, divine of hue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On the ground so firm and true?</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How are we to know you, pray?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.262}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sirī, hearing him, spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;The great king Dhataraṭṭha is my sire:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fortune and Luck am I, and Wisdom men admire:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Neither fortune nor misfortune can a man make for his brothers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Such was Sirī&rsquo;s answer when questioned by the merchant. <span class="t18">{3.264}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta rejoiced at Sirī&rsquo;s words, and said: &ldquo;Here is the pure seat and bed, proper for you; sit and lie down there.&rdquo; She stayed there and in the morning departed to the Heaven of the Four Great Kings and bathed first in Lake Anotatta.

<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as a chicken and lived in the forest with a retinue of many hundred chickens. Not far away lived a female cat; and she deceived <span class="t18">[3.169] </span>by devices the other chickens except the Bodhisatta and ate them; but the Bodhisatta did not fall into her power. She thought: &ldquo;This chicken is very crafty, but he knows not that I am crafty and have skill in means: it is good that I cajole him, saying, &lsquo;I will be your wife,&rsquo; and so eat him when he comes into my power.&rdquo; She went to the root of the tree where he perched, and praying him in a speech preceded by praise of his beauty, she spoke the first verse:</p>

<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta hearing her thought: &ldquo;She has eaten all my relatives; now she wishes to cajole and eat me: I will get rid of her.&rdquo; So he spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Lady fair and winning, you have four feet, I have only two:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Honoured wife or simple slave girl, at your pleasure deal with me.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;You have drunk my kindred&rsquo;s blood, and robbed and slain them cruelly:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Honoured wife! There is no honour in your heart when wooing me.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as a bird: when he grew up he lived amidst a retinue of birds on an island in the middle of the sea. Certain merchants of Kāsi got a travelled crow and started on a voyage by sea. In the midst of the sea the ship was wrecked. The crow reached that island and thought: &ldquo;Here is a great flock of birds, it is good that I use deceit on them and eat their eggs and young,&rdquo; so he descended in their midst and opening his mouth stood with one foot on the ground. &ldquo;Who are you, master?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;I am a holy person.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why do you stand on one foot?&rdquo; &ldquo;If I put down the other one, <span class="t18">{3.268}</span> the earth could not bear me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then why do you stand with your mouth open?&rdquo; &ldquo;We eat no other food, we only drink the wind,&rdquo; and with this he called these birds and saying: &ldquo;I will give you a sermon, you listen,&rdquo; he spoke the first verse by way of a sermon:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9274"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Practise virtue, brethren, bless you! Practise virtue, I repeat:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here and after virtuous people have their happiness complete.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The birds, not knowing that he said this with deceit to eat their eggs, praised him and spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Surely a righteous fowl, a blessed bird,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He preaches on one leg the holy word.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The birds, believing that wicked one, said: &ldquo;Sir, you take no other food but feed on wind only: so pray watch our eggs and young,&rdquo; so they went to their feeding-ground. That sinner when they went away ate his bellyful of their eggs and young, and when they came again he stood calmly on one foot with his mouth open. The birds not seeing their children when they came made a great outcry, &ldquo;Who can be eating them?&rdquo; but saying: &ldquo;This crow is a holy person,&rdquo; they did not even suspect him.</p>
<p class="p7">Then one day the Bodhisatta thought: &ldquo;There was nothing <span class="t18">[3.171] </span>wrong here formerly, it only began since this one came, it is good to try him,&rdquo; so making as if he were going to feed with the other birds he turned back and stood in a secret place. <span class="t18">{3.269}</span> The crow, confident because the birds were gone, rose and went and ate the eggs and young, then coming back stood on one foot with his mouth open. When the birds came, their king assembled them all and said: &ldquo;I examined today the danger to our children, and I saw this wicked crow eating them, we will seize him,&rdquo; so getting the birds together and surrounding the crow he said: &ldquo;If he flees, let us seize him,&rdquo; and spoke the remaining verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;You know not his ways, when this bird you praise:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You spoke with foolish tongue:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Virtue, he&rsquo;ll say, and Virtue aye,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But he eats our eggs and young.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. The things he preaches with his voice</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His members never do:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His Virtue is an empty noise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His righteousness untrue.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. At heart a hypocrite, his language charms,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A black snake slinking to his hole is he:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He deceives by his outward coat of arms</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The country-folk in their simplicity.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Strike him down with beak and pinion,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tear him with your claws:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Death to such a dastard minion,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Traitor to our cause.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.270}</span></p>
<p class="p6">With these words the leader of the birds himself sprang up and struck the crow in the head with his beak, and the rest struck him with beaks and feet and wings: so he died.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At the end of the lesson, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the crow was the deceitful monk, the king of the birds was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk supports his parents for which the Buddha commends him. The Buddha tells a story of a deer who used himself as a decoy in order to save his parents, and later got the king to offer safe passage to all the animals in his kingdom.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Will you go to the king&rsquo;s park.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this in Jetavana, about a monk who supported his mother. He asked the monk, &ldquo;Is it true that you support lay folk?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; &ldquo;My father and mother, </span><span class="t18">[3.172] </span><span class="t30">lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well done, well done, monk: you keep up the rule of the wise men of old, for they too even when born as beasts gave their life for their parents,&rdquo; and so he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when the Kosala king was reigning over the Kosalas in Sāketa, the Bodhisatta was born as a deer; when he grew up he was named Nandiyamiga, and being excellent in character and conduct he supported his father and mother. The Kosala king was intent on the chase, and went every day to hunt with a great retinue, so that his people could not follow farming and their trades. The people gathered together and consulted, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, this king of ours is destroying our trades, our home-life is perishing; what if we were to enclose the Añjanavana park, providing a gate, digging a tank and sowing grass there, then go into the forest with sticks and clubs in our hands, beat the thickets, and so expelling the deer and driving them along force them into the park like cows into a pen? Then we would close the gate, send word to the king and go about our trades.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is the way,&rdquo; they said, and so with one will they made the park ready, and then entering the wood enclosed a space <span class="t18">{3.271}</span> of a league each way.</p>
<p class="p7">At the time Nandiya had taken his father and mother into a little thicket and was lying on the ground. The people with various shields and weapons in their hands encircled the thicket arm to arm; and some entered it looking for deer. Nandiya saw them and thought: &ldquo;It is good that I should abandon life today and give it for my parents,&rdquo; so rising and saluting his parents he said: &ldquo;Father and mother, these men will see us three if they enter this thicket; you can survive only in one way, and your life is best: I will give you the gift of your life, standing by the skirts of the thicket and going out as soon as they beat it; then they will think there can be only one deer in this little thicket and so will not enter: be heedful,&rdquo; so he got their permission and stood ready to run. As soon as the thicket was beaten by the people standing at its skirts and shouting he came out, and they thinking there would be only one deer there did not enter.</p>
<p class="p7">Nandiya went among the other deer, and the people drove them along into the park; then closing the gate they told the king and went to their own homes. From that time the king always went himself and shot a deer; then he either took it and went away, or sent for it and had it fetched. The deer arranged their turns, and he to whom the turn came stood on one side: and they take him when shot. Nandiya drank water from the tank, and ate the grass, but his turn did not come yet. Then after many days his parents longing to see him thought: &ldquo;Our son Nandiya, king of deer, was strong as an elephant and of perfect health: if he is alive he will certainly leap the fence and come to see us; we will send him <span class="t18">{3.272}</span> word,&rdquo; so they stood near the road and <span class="t18">[3.173] </span><a id="a9285"></a>seeing a brahmin they asked in human voice, &ldquo;Sir, where are you going?&rdquo; &ldquo;To Sāketa,&rdquo; he said; so sending a message to their son they spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9286"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Will you go to the king&rsquo;s park, brahmin, when you are travelling through?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Find out our dear son Nandiya and tell him our message true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your father and mother are stricken in years and their hearts are fain for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The brahmin, saying: &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; accepted, and going to Sāketa next day entered the park, and asked, &ldquo;Which is Nandiya?&rdquo; The deer came near him and said: &ldquo;I.&rdquo; The brahmin told his message. Nandiya, hearing it, said: &ldquo;I might go, brahmin; I might certainly leap the fence and go: but I have enjoyed regular food and drink from the king, and this stands to me as a debt; besides I have lived long among these deer, and it is improper for me to go away without doing good to this king and to them, or without showing my strength; but when my turn comes I will do good to them and come gladly,&rdquo; and so explaining this, he spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;I owe the king my daily drink and food:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I cannot go till I have made it good.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. To the king&rsquo;s arrows I&rsquo;ll expose my side:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then see my mother and be justified.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.273}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9287"></a>The brahmin hearing this went away. Afterwards on the day when his turn came, the king with a great retinue came into the park. The Bodhisatta stood on one side: and the king saying: &ldquo;I will shoot the deer,&rdquo; fitted a sharp arrow to the string. The Bodhisatta did not run away as other animals do when scared by the fear of death, but fearless and making his generosity his guide he stood firm, exposing his side with mighty ribs. The king owing to the efficacy of his love could not discharge the arrow. The Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;Great king, why do you not shoot the arrow? Shoot!&rdquo; &ldquo;King of deer, I cannot.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then see the merit of the virtuous,<a id="a9288"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15608"><span class="t9">{652}</span></a><a id="a9289"></a> O great king.&rdquo; Then the king, pleased with the Bodhisatta, dropped his bow and said: &ldquo;This senseless length of wood knows your merit; shall I who have sense and am a man not know it? Forgive me; I give you security.&rdquo; &ldquo;Great king, you give me security, but what will this herd of deer in the park do?&rdquo; &ldquo;I give it to them too.&rdquo; So the Bodhisatta, having gained security for all deer in the park, for birds in the air and fishes in the water, in the way described in the Nigrodhajātaka [Ja 12], established the king in the Five Precepts and said: &ldquo;Great king, it is good for a king to rule a kingdom by forsaking the ways of wrongdoing, not offending against the ten kingly virtues and acting with just righteousness. <span class="t18">[3.174] {3.274}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Alms, morals, generosity, justice and penitence,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Peace, mildness, mercy, meekness, patience:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. These virtues planted in my soul I feel,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thence springs up joy and perfect inward weal.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">With these words he showed forth the kingly virtues in the form of a verse, and after staying some days with the king he sent a golden drum round the town, proclaiming the gift of security to all beings: and then saying: &ldquo;O king, be watchful,&rdquo; he went to see his parents.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Of old in Oudh a king of deer I hight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By name and nature, Nandiya, Delight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. To kill me in his deer-park came the king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His bow was bent, his arrow on the string.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. To the king&rsquo;s arrow I exposed my side;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then saw my mother and was justified.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">These were the verses spoken after Fully Awakening.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At the end, the Teacher declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka. At the end of the Truths, the monk who supported his mother was established in the First Path. &ldquo;At that time the father and mother were members of the royal family, the brahmin was Sāriputta, the king Ānanda, the deer myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Goats are stupid.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{3.275}</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this tale in Jetavana, concerning the temptation of a monk by his former wife. When the monk confessed that he was longing for the world, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monk, this woman does you harm: formerly also you came into the fire through her and were saved from death by sages,&rdquo; so he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when a king named Senaka was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was Sakka. The king Senaka was friendly with a certain Nāga king. This Nāga king, they say, left the Nāga world and ranged the <span class="t18">[3.175] </span>earth seeking food. The village boys seeing him said: &ldquo;This is a snake,&rdquo; and struck him with clods and other things. The king, going to amuse himself in his garden, saw them, and being told they were beating a snake, said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them beat him, drive them away,&rdquo; and this was done. So the Nāga king got his life, and when he went back to the Nāga world, he took many jewels, and coming at midnight to the king&rsquo;s bedchamber he gave them to him, saying: &ldquo;I got my life through you,&rdquo; so he made friendship with the king and came again and again to see him. He appointed one of his Nāgīs, insatiate in pleasures, to be near the king and protect him: and he gave the king a charm, saying: &ldquo;If ever you do not see her, repeat this charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9298"></a>One day the king went to the garden with the Nāgī and was amusing himself in the lotus-tank. The Nāgī seeing a water-snake quit her human shape and made love with him. The king not seeing the Nāgī said, <span class="t18">{3.276}</span> &ldquo;Where is she gone?&rdquo; and repeated the spell: then he saw her in her misconduct and struck her with a piece of bamboo. She went in anger to the Nāga world, and when she was asked, &ldquo;Why are you come?&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;Your friend struck me on the back because I did not do his bidding,&rdquo; showing the mark of the blow. The Nāga king, not knowing the truth, called four Nāga youths and sent them with orders to enter Senaka&rsquo;s bed chamber and destroy him like chaff by the breath of their nostrils. They entered the chamber at the royal bed-time. As they came in, the king was saying to the queen, &ldquo;Lady, do you know where the Nāgī has gone?&rdquo; &ldquo;King, I do not.&rdquo; &ldquo;Today when we were bathing in the tank, she quit her shape and committed adultery with a water-snake: I said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; and struck her with a piece of bamboo to give her a lesson: and now I fear she may have gone to the Nāga world and told some lie to my friend, destroying his good-will to me.&rdquo; The young Nāgas hearing this turned back at once to the Nāga world and told their king. He being moved went instantly to the king&rsquo;s chamber, told him all and was forgiven: then be said: &ldquo;In this way I make amends,&rdquo; and gave the king a charm giving knowledge of all sounds, &ldquo;This, O king, is a priceless spell: if you give anyone this spell you will at once enter the fire and die.&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; and accepted it.</p>
<p class="p7">From that time he understood the voices even of ants. One day he was sitting on the dais eating solid food with honey and molasses: and a drop of honey, a drop of molasses, and a morsel of cake fell on the ground. An ant seeing this came crying, &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s honey jar is broken on the dais, his molasses-cart <span class="t18">{3.277}</span> and cake-cart are upset; come and eat honey and molasses and cake.&rdquo; The king hearing the cry laughed. The queen being near him thought: &ldquo;What has the king seen that he laughs?&rdquo; When the king had eaten his solid food and bathed and sat down cross-legged, a fly said to his wife, &ldquo;Come, lady, let us enjoy love.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;Excuse me for a little, husband: they <span class="t18">[3.176] </span>will soon be bringing perfumes to the king; as he perfumes himself some powder will fall at his feet: I will stay there and become fragrant, then we will enjoy ourselves lying on the king&rsquo;s back.&rdquo; The king hearing the voice laughed again. The queen thought again, &ldquo;What has he seen that he laughs?&rdquo; Again when the king was eating his supper, a lump of rice fell on the ground. The ants cried, &ldquo;A wagon of rice has broken in the king&rsquo;s palace, and there is none to eat it.&rdquo; The king hearing this laughed again. The queen took a golden spoon and helping him reflected: &ldquo;Is it at the sight of me that the king laughs?&rdquo; She went to the bed-chamber with the king and at bed-time she asked, &ldquo;Why did you laugh, O king?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;What have you to do with why I laugh?&rdquo; but being asked again and again he told her. Then she said: &ldquo;Give me your spell of knowledge.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;It cannot be given,&rdquo; but though repulsed she pressed him again.</p>
<p class="p7">The king said: &ldquo;If I give you this spell, I shall die.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even though you die, give it me.&rdquo; The king, being in the power of womankind, saying: &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; consented and went to the park in a chariot, saying: &ldquo;I shall enter the fire after giving away this spell.&rdquo; At that moment, Sakka, king of gods, looked down on the earth and seeing this case said: &ldquo;This foolish king, knowing that he will enter the fire through womankind, is on his way; I will give him his life,&rdquo; so he took Sujā, daughter of the Asuras, and went to Benares. <span class="t18">{3.278}</span> He became a he-goat and made her a female goat, and resolving that the people should not see them, he stood before the king&rsquo;s chariot. The king and the Sindh asses yoked in the chariot saw him, but none else saw him. For the sake of starting talk he was as if making love with the female goat. One of the Sindh asses yoked in the chariot seeing him said: &ldquo;Friend goat, we have heard before, but not seen, that goats are stupid and shameless: but you are doing, with all of us looking on, this thing that should be done in secret and in a private place, and are not ashamed: what we have heard before agrees with this that we see,&rdquo; and so he spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9299"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Goats are stupid, says the wise man, and the words are surely true:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This one knows not he&rsquo;s parading what in secret he should do.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The goat hearing him spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;O, sir donkey, think and realise your own stupidity,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You&rsquo;re tied with ropes, your jaw is wrenched, and very downcast is your eye.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. When you&rsquo;re loosed, you don&rsquo;t escape, sir, that&rsquo;s a stupid habit too:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And that Senaka you carry, he&rsquo;s more stupid still than you.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.279}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king understood the talk of both animals, and hearing it he quickly sent away the chariot. The ass hearing the goat&rsquo;s talk spoke the fourth verse: <span class="t18">[3.177]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Well, sir king of goats, you fully know my great stupidity:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But how Senaka is stupid, pray you do explain to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The goat explaining this spoke the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;He who his own special treasure on his wife will throw away,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cannot keep her faithful ever and his life he must betray.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king hearing his words said: &ldquo;King of goats, you will surely act for my advantage: tell me now what is right for me to do.&rdquo; Then the goat said: &ldquo;King, to all animals no one is dearer than self: it is not good <span class="t18">{3.280}</span> to destroy oneself and abandon the honour one has gained for the sake of anything that is dear,&rdquo; so he spoke the sixth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;A king, like you, may have conceived desire</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And yet renounced it if his life&rsquo;s the cost;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Life is the chief thing: what can man seek higher?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If life&rsquo;s secured, desires need ne&rsquo;er be crossed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So the Bodhisatta exhorted the king. The king, delighted, asked, &ldquo;King of goats, whence come you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am Sakka, O king, come to save you from death out of pity for you.&rdquo; &ldquo;King of gods, I promised to give her the charm: what am I to do now?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no need for the ruin of both of you: you say, &lsquo;It is the way of the craft,&rsquo; and have her beaten with some blows: by this means she will not get it.&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; and agreed. The Bodhisatta after exhortation to the king went to Sakka&rsquo;s heaven. The king went to the garden, had the queen summoned and then said: &ldquo;Lady, will you have the charm?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then go through the usual custom.&rdquo; &ldquo;What custom?&rdquo; &ldquo;A hundred stripes <span class="t18">{3.281}</span> on the back, but you must not make a sound.&rdquo; She consented through greed for the charm. The king made his slaves take whips and beat her on both sides. She endured two or three stripes and then cried, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the charm.&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;You would have killed me to get the charm,&rdquo; and so flogging the skin off her back he sent her away. After that she could not bear to talk of it again.</p>

The occasion of the tale will be given in the Mahā-ummagga [Ja 546].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9309"></a><span class="t34">One day the monks sat in the Dhamma Hall and described the Tathāgata&rsquo;s Perfection of Wisdom, &ldquo;Monks, the Tathāgata is greatly wise, his wisdom is vast, ready, swift, sharp, crushing heretical doctrines, after having converted, by the power of his own knowledge, the brahmins Kūṭadanta and the rest, the ascetics Sabhiya and the rest, the thieves Aṅgulimāla and the rest, the Yakkhas Āḷavaka and the rest, the Devas Sakka and the rest, and the Brahmās Baka and the rest, made them humble, and ordained a vast multitude as ascetics and established them in the fruition of the paths of sanctification.&rdquo; The Teacher came up and asked what they were discoursing about, and they told him..</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher addressed the monks, &ldquo;Not only is the Tathāgata wise this one time, but he was wise before, and had skill in means,&rdquo; and so he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9310"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in the kingdom of Kāsi in a smith&rsquo;s family, and when he grew up he became excellent in the craft. His parents were poor. Not far from their village was another smith&rsquo;s village of a thousand houses. The principal smith of the thousand was a favourite of the king, rich and of great substance. His daughter was exceedingly beautiful, like to a Devaccharā, with all the auspicious marks of a lady of the land. People came from the villages round to have razors, axes, ploughshares and goads made, and generally saw that maiden. When they went back to their own villages, they praised her beauty <span class="t18">{3.282}</span> in the places where men sit and elsewhere. The Bodhisatta, being attracted by merely hearing of her, thought: &ldquo;I will make her my wife,&rdquo; so he took iron of the best kind, and made one delicate strong needle which pierced dice and floated on water: then he made a sheath for it of the same kind and pierced dice with it: and in the same way he made seven sheaths: how he made them is not to be told, for such work prospers through the greatness of the Bodhisattas&rsquo; knowledge. Then he put the needle in a tube and placing it in a case he went to that village and asked for the street where the head smith&rsquo;s house was: then standing at the door he said: &ldquo;Who will buy for money from my hand a needle of this kind?&rdquo; describing the needle, and so standing by the head smith&rsquo;s house he spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9311"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Quickly threaded, smooth and straight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Polished with emery,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sharp of point and delicate,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Needles! Who will buy?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After this he praised it again and spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Quickly threaded, strong and straight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Rounded properly,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Iron they will penetrate,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Needles! Who will buy?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.179]</span><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{3.283}</span></p>
<p class="p6">At that moment the maiden was fanning her father with a palm-leaf as he lay on a little bed to allay discomfort after his early meal, and hearing the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s sweet voice, as if she had been sickened by a fresh lump of meat, and had the discomfort extinguished by a thousand pots of water, she said: &ldquo;Who is this hawking needles with a sweet voice in a village of smiths? For what business has he come? I will find out,&rdquo; so laying down the palm-fan she went out and spoke with him outside, standing in the verandah. The purpose of Bodhisattas prospers: it was for her sake he had come to that village. She speaking with him said: &ldquo;Young man, dwellers in all the kingdom come to this village for needles and the like: it is in folly you wish to sell needles in a village of smiths; though you declare the praise of your needle all day no one will take it from your hand; if you wish to get a price, go to another village,&rdquo; so she spoke two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Our hooks are sold, both up and down,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Men know our needles well:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We all are smiths in this good town:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Needles! Who can sell?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. In iron-work we have renown,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In weapons we excel:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We all are smiths in this good town:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Needles! Who can sell?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta hearing her words said: &ldquo;Lady, you say this not knowing and in ignorance,&rdquo; and so he spoke two verses: <span class="t18">{3.284}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Though all are smiths in this good town,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet skill can needles sell;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For masters in the craft will own</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A first-rate article.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Lady, if once your father know</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This needle made by me;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On me your hand he would bestow</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And all his property.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The head smith hearing all their talk called his daughter and asked, &ldquo;Who is that you are talking to?&rdquo; &ldquo;Father, a man selling needles.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then call him here.&rdquo; She went and called him. The Bodhisatta saluted the head smith and stood by. The head smith asked, &ldquo;Of what village are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am of such a village and son of such a smith.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why are you come here?&rdquo; &ldquo;To sell needles.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come, let us see your needle.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.285}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta, wishing to declare his qualities among them all, said: &ldquo;Is not a thing seen in the midst of all better than one seen by each singly?&rdquo; &ldquo;Quite right, friend.&rdquo; So he gathered all the smiths together and in their midst said: &ldquo;Sir, take the needle.&rdquo; &ldquo;Teacher, have an anvil brought and a bronze dish full of water.&rdquo; This was done. The Bodhisatta took the needle-tube from the wrapper and gave it to <span class="t18">[3.180] </span>them. The head smith taking it asked, &ldquo;Is this the needle?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, it is not the needle, it is the sheath.&rdquo; He, after examining it, could not see end nor tip. The Bodhisatta, taking it from them, drew off the sheath with his nail and showing it to the people with, &ldquo;This is the needle, this is the sheath,&rdquo; he put the needle in the master&rsquo;s hand and the sheath at his feet. Again when the master said: &ldquo;This is the needle, I suppose,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;This too is a sheath,&rdquo; then he struck it off with his nail, and so he laid six sheaths in succession at the head smith&rsquo;s feet and saying: &ldquo;Here is the needle,&rdquo; laid it on his hand.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9312"></a>The thousand smiths snapped their fingers in delight, and the waving of cloths began; then the head smith asked, &ldquo;Friend, what is the strength of this needle?&rdquo; &ldquo;Teacher, have this anvil raised up by a strong man and a water-vessel set under the anvil: then strike the needle straight into the anvil.&rdquo; He had this done and struck the needle by the point into the anvil. The needle<a id="a9313"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15612"><span class="t9">{654}</span></a> piercing the anvil lay across on the surface of the water not moving a hair&rsquo;s breadth up or down. All the smiths said: &ldquo;We have never heard all this time even by rumour that there are such smiths as this,&rdquo; so they snapped their fingers and waved a thousand cloths. <span class="t18">{3.286}</span><a id="a9314"></a> The head smith called his daughter and in the midst of the assembly saying: &ldquo;This maiden is a suitable match for you,&rdquo; he poured water on<a id="a9315"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15614"><span class="t9">{655}</span></a> them and gave her away. And afterwards when the head smith died the Bodhisatta became head smith in the village.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The smith&rsquo;s daughter was Rāhula&rsquo;s mother, the clever young smith was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
