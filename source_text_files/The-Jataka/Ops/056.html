<p class="p7"><a id="a8424"></a><span class="t15">In the present the monks go round asking people to give them workers and goods for the huts they are building. The Buddha reproves them and tells a story of how an ascetic in bygone days had been too ashamed to ask a king for a pair of shoes and an umbrella and had dallied for twelve years before giving his request.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Such is the quality.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8427"></a><a id="a8428"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher, while dwelling in the Aggāḷava shrine near Āḷavī, concerning the regulations to be observed in the building of cells.</span><a id="a8429"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15466"><span class="t9">{586}</span></a><a id="a8430"></a><a id="a8431"></a><span class="t30"> The introductory story has already been set forth in the Maṇikaṇṭhajātaka [Ja 253].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8432"></a><span class="t34">Some monks who lived in Āḷavī were begging from all quarters the materials for houses which they were getting made for themselves. They were for ever asking, &ldquo;Give us a man, give us somebody to do servant&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; and so forth. Everybody was annoyed at this begging and solicitation. So much annoyed were they, that at sight of these monks they were startled and scared away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">It happened that the venerable monk Mahākassapa entered Āḷavī, and traversed the place in quest of alms. The people, as soon as they saw the elder, ran away as before. After mealtime, having returned from his rounds, he summoned the monks, and thus addressed them, &ldquo;Once Āḷavī was a good place for alms; why is it so poor now?&rdquo; They told him the reason.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now the Fortunate One was at the time dwelling at the Aggāḷava shrine. The elder came to the Fortunate One, and told him all about it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8433"></a><span class="t30">But on this occasion the Teacher said: &ldquo;Is it true, monks, that you live here by your importunity in asking and begging for alms?&rdquo; And when they answered, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he reproved them and said: &ldquo;Wise men of old, when offered their choice by the king, though they were longing to ask for a pair of single-soled shoes, through fear of doing violence to their sensitive and scrupulous nature, did not venture to say a word in the presence of the people, but spoke in private.&rdquo; And so saying he told them a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{3.79}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past in the Kampillaka kingdom, when a Pañcāla king was reigning in a north Pañcāla city, the Bodhisatta was born into a brahmin family, in a certain market town. And when he was grown up, he acquired a knowledge of the arts at Taxila. Afterwards taking ordination as an ascetic and dwelling in the Himālayas, he lived for a long time by what he could glean &ndash; feeding on wild fruits and roots.<span class="t18"> [3.53]</span></p>
<p class="p7">And wandering into the haunts of men for the purpose of procuring salt and vinegar, he came to a city of north Pañcāla and took up his abode in the king&rsquo;s garden. Next day he went into the city to beg alms, and came to the king&rsquo;s gate. The king was so pleased with his deportment and behaviour that be seated him on the dais and fed him with food worthy of a king. And he bound him by a solemn promise and assigned him a lodging in the garden.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8434"></a>He lived constantly in the king&rsquo;s house, and at the end of the rainy season, being anxious to return to the Himālayas, he thought: &ldquo;If I go upon this journey, I must get a pair of single-soled shoes<a id="a8435"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15468"><span class="t9">{587}</span></a> and a parasol of leaves. I will beg them of the king.&rdquo; One day he came to the garden, and finding the king sitting there, he saluted him and resolved he would ask him for the shoes and parasol. But his second thought was, &ldquo;A man who begs of another, saying, &lsquo;Give me so and so,&rsquo; is apt to weep. And the other man also when he refuses, saying, &lsquo;I have it not,&rsquo; in his turn weeps.&rdquo; And that the people might not see either him or the king weeping, he thought: &ldquo;We will both weep quietly in some secret place.&rdquo; So he said: &ldquo;Great king, I am anxious to speak with you in private.&rdquo; The royal attendants on hearing this departed. Thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;If the king should refuse my prayer, our friendship will be at an end. So I will not ask a boon of him.&rdquo; That day, not venturing to mention the subject, he said: &ldquo;Go now, Great king, I will see about this matter by and by.&rdquo; Another day on the king&rsquo;s coming to the garden, saying, as before, first this and then that, he could not frame his request. And so twelve years elapsed.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king thought, <span class="t18">{3.80}</span> &ldquo;This priest said, &lsquo;I wish to speak in private,&rsquo; and when the courtiers are departed, he has not the courage to speak. And while he is longing to do so, twelve years have elapsed. After living an ascetic life so long, I suspect, he is regretting the world. He is eager to enjoy pleasures and is longing for sovereignty. But being unable to frame the word &lsquo;Kingdom,&rsquo; he keeps silent. Today now I will offer him whatever he desires, from my kingdom downwards.&rdquo; So he went to the garden and sitting down saluted him. The Bodhisatta asked to speak to him in private, and when the courtiers had departed, he could not utter a word. The king said: &ldquo;For twelve years you have asked to speak to me in private, and when you have had the opportunity, you have not been able to say a word. I offer you everything, beginning with my kingdom. Do not be afraid, but ask for whatever you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Great king,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you give me what I want?&rdquo;<span class="t18"> [3.54] </span>&ldquo;Yes, venerable sir, I will.&rdquo; &ldquo;Great king, when I go on my journey, I must have a pair of single-soled shoes and a parasol of leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Have you not been able, sir, for twelve years to ask for such a trifle as this?&rdquo; &ldquo;That is so, Great king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why, sir, did you act thus?&rdquo; &ldquo;Great king, the man who says &lsquo;Give me so and so,&rsquo; sheds tears, and the one who refuses and says &lsquo;I have it not,&rsquo; in his turn weeps. If, when I begged, you should have refused me, I feared the people might see us mingling our tears. This is why I asked for a secret interview.&rdquo; Then from the beginning he repeated three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Such is the quality of prayer, O king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twill a rich gift or a refusal bring.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Who beg, Pañcāla lord, to weep are fain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They who refuse are apt to weep again.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Lest people see us shed the idle tear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My prayer I whisper in your secret ear.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.81}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king, being charmed with this mark of respect on the part of the Bodhisatta, granted him the boon and spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Brahmin, I offer you a thousand kine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Red kine, and eke the leader of the herd;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hearing but now these generous words of thine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I too in turn to generous deed am stirred.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;I do not, sire, desire material pleasures. Give me only that which I ask for.&rdquo; And he took a pair of single-soled shoes and the parasol of leaves, and exhorted the king to be zealous in the dispensation and to keep the moral law and observe fast days. And though the king begged him to stay, he went off to the Himālayas, where he developed the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and was destined to birth in the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the king, and I myself was the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one wanderer on his rounds meets with a ram, who he thinks is paying respects to him, whereas he is just winding up to butt him, which he does, and in a deadly way. The Buddha tells a similar story of the past, and of a dialogue that occurred before the deadly blow.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the wise merchant (paṇḍitavāṇija),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;The kindly beast.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.55] {3.82}</span><a id="a8446"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while living at Jetavana, about Cammasāṭaka, a mendicant monk who wore a leather jacket.</span><a id="a8447"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15470"><span class="t9">{588}</span></a><a id="a8448"></a><span class="t30"> Both his upper and under garment, it is said, were of leather. One day sallying out of the monastery, he went his rounds in Sāvatthi for alms, till he came to the fighting-ground of the rams. A ram on seeing him drew back, desiring to butt him. The mendicant thought: &ldquo;He is doing this, as an act of respect for me,&rdquo; and himself did not draw back. The ram came on with a rush and striking him on the thigh felled him to the ground. This case of imaginary salutation was blazed abroad in the Saṅgha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The matter was discussed by them in the Dhamma Hall, as to how the leather-coated mendicant fancied he was being saluted and met with his death. The Teacher came and inquired into the subject of their discussion and on being told what it was said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but of old too this ascetic imagined he was being saluted and so came by his death,&rdquo; and he then related to them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past the Bodhisatta was born in a merchant family and plied his trade. At that time a certain mendicant, clad in a leather garment, in going his rounds for alms, came to the rams&rsquo; fighting ground, and on seeing a ram falling back before him, he fancied it did this as a mark of respect, and did not himself retire. &ldquo;In the whole world,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;this ram alone recognises my merits,&rdquo; and raising his joined hands in respectful salutation he stood and repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;The kindly beast obeisance makes before</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The high-caste brahmin versed in holy lore.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Good honest creature you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Famous above all other beasts, I vow!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.83}</span></p>
<p class="p6">At this moment a wise merchant sitting in his stores, to restrain the mendicant, uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Brahmin, be not so rash this beast to trust,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Else will he haste to lay you in the dust,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For this the ram falls back,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To gain an impetus for his attack.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">While this wise merchant was still speaking, the ram came on at full speed, and striking the mendicant on the thigh, knocked him down. He <span class="t18">[3.56] </span>was maddened with the pain and as he lay groaning, the Teacher, to explain the incident, gave utterance to the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;With broken leg and bowl for alms upset,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His damaged fortune he will sore regret.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let him not weep with outstretched arms in vain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Haste to the rescue, ere the monk is slain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the mendicant repeated the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Thus all that honour to the unworthy pay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Share the same fate that I have met today;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Prone in the dust by butting ram laid low</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To foolish confidence my death I owe.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.84}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus lamenting he there and then came by his death.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The man in the leather coat of today was the same then as now. And I myself was the wise merchant.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk makes his living in deceptive ways. The Buddha tells a story of a lizard who used to visit an ascetic. The latter, getting a taste for lizard meat, tried to kill his visitor, but the latter was too smart for him and drove him away.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a8456"></a><a id="a8457"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the king of the iguanas (godharājā),</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a8458"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Falsity, Cheating, Animals.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;One that plays.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher, while living at Jetavana, with regard to a certain cheating monk. The introductory story has already been given in full.</span><a id="a8459"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15472"><span class="t9">{589}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">But on this occasion they brought the monk to the Teacher and exposed him, saying: &ldquo;Venerable sir, this monk is a cheat.&rdquo; The Teacher said: &ldquo;Not only now, but formerly also he was a rogue.&rdquo; And then he told a story about the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as a young lizard, and when he grew up and was lusty and strong, he dwelt in a forest. And a certain wicked ascetic built a hut of leaves, and took up his abode near him. The Bodhisatta, in ranging about for food, saw this hut of leaves and thought to himself,<span class="t18"> [3.57] </span>&ldquo;This hut must certainly belong to some holy ascetic,&rdquo; and he went there and after saluting the holy man returned to his own place of abode.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day this false ascetic ate some savoury food prepared in the house of one of his retainers, and asked what meat it was. On hearing that it was lizard-flesh, he became such a slave to his love of dainties that he thought: &ldquo;I will kill this lizard that so constantly keeps coming to my hermitage and will cook him to my taste and eat him.&rdquo; So he took some ghee, curds, condiments and the like, and went with his club concealed under his yellow robe and sat perfectly still at the door of his hut, waiting for the Bodhisatta to come, as quiet as quiet could be. <span class="t18">{3.85}</span></p>
<p class="p7">When the Bodhisatta saw this depraved fellow he thought: &ldquo;This wretch must have been eating the flesh of my kinsfolk. I will put it to the test.&rdquo; So he stood to leeward of him and getting a whiff from his person he knew that he had been eating the flesh of a lizard, and without going near him he turned back and made off. And when the ascetic saw he was not coming, he threw his club at him. The club missed his body, but just reached the tip of his tail. The ascetic said: &ldquo;Be off with you, I have missed you.&rdquo; Said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Yes, you have missed me, but you will not miss the fourfold States of Suffering.&rdquo; Than he ran off and disappeared in an ant-hill which stood at the end of the cloister walk, and putting out his head at some other hole, he addressed the ascetic in these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;One that plays the ascetic role</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should exhibit self-control.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You did hurl your stick at me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">False ascetic you must be.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Matted locks and robe of skin</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Serve to cloak some secret wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fool! To cleanse for outward show,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Leaving what is foul below.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The ascetic, on hearing this, replied in a third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Pray you, lizard, hasten back,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Oil and salt I do not lack:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pepper too I would suggest</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May to boiled rice add a zest.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.86}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta, on hearing this, uttered the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;I will hide me snug and warm</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Midst the anthill&rsquo;s myriad swarm.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cease of oil and salt to prate,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pepper I abominate.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Moreover he threatened him and said: &ldquo;Fie! False ascetic, if you continue to dwell here, I will have you seized as a thief by the people who <span class="t18">[3.58] </span>live in my feeding ground, and given over to destruction. So make haste and be off.&rdquo; Then the false ascetic fled from that place.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the rogue of a monk was the false ascetic, but I myself was the royal lizard.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Devadatta tries to deceive the Saṅgha into following himself, but it ends with him vomiting up blood. The Buddha tells a story of an ascetic of old who tried to fool the gods into giving him heavenly flowers by lying about his own virtues. The flowers when placed on his head were a torture, and he had to get them removed by the gods.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;He that from thievish act.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while he was at Jetavana, about Devadatta, how after causing a schism in the Saṅgha, as he was going away with the Chief Disciples, when the assembly broke up, a hot stream of blood gushed from his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the monks discussed the matter in the Dhamma Hall, and said that Devadatta by speaking falsely had created a schism, and afterwards fell sick and suffered great pain. The Teacher came and inquired what subject the monks were discussing as they sat in a meeting, and on hearing what it was he said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but of old too this fellow was a liar, and not only now, but of old also he suffered pain as the penalty of lying.&rdquo; And so saying he repeated this old world legend. </span><span class="t18">{3.87}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8472"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta became a certain Devaputta in the heaven of the Thirty-Three. Now at this time there was a great festival at Benares. A crowd of Nāgas and Garuḷas and Bhūmadeva came and watched the festival. And four Devaputtas from the heaven of the Thirty-Three, wearing a wreath made of heavenly kakkāru flowers, came to see the festival. And the city for the space of twelve leagues was filled with the fragrance of these flowers. Men moved about, wondering by whom these flowers were worn. The Devaputtas said: &ldquo;They are watching us,&rdquo; and flying up from the royal court, by an act of supernatural power they stood poised in the air. The multitude gathered together, and the king with his vassal princes came and asked from what world of the gods they had come.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;We come from the heaven of the Thirty-Three.&rdquo; &ldquo;For what purpose are you come?&rdquo; &ldquo;To see the festival.&rdquo;<span class="t18"> [3.59] </span>&ldquo;What are these flowers?&rdquo; &ldquo;They are called the heavenly kakkāru flowers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;in the world of the Devaputtas you may have other flowers to wear. Give these to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8473"></a>The Devaputtas made answer, &ldquo;These divine flowers are fit for those possessed of great powers: for the base, foolish, faithless and sinful beings in this world of men they are not fitted. But whosoever amongst men are endued with such and such virtues, for them they are suitable.&rdquo; And with these words the chief amongst these Devaputtas repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;He that from thievish act refrains,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His tongue from lying word restrains,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And reaching dizzy heights of fame</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Still keeps his head &ndash; this flower may claim.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.88}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the family priest thought: &ldquo;I own not one of these qualities, but by telling a lie I will get these flowers to wear, and thus the people will credit me with these virtues.&rdquo; Then he said: &ldquo;I am endued with these qualities,&rdquo; and he had the flowers brought to him and he put them on, and then begged of the second Devaputta, who replied in a second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;He that should honest wealth pursue</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And riches gained by fraud eschew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In pleasure gross excess would shun,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This heavenly flower has duly won.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Said the priest, &ldquo;I am endued with these virtues,&rdquo; and had the flowers brought to him and put them on, and then begged of the third Devaputta, who uttered the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;He that from purpose fixed ne&rsquo;er swerves</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And his unchanging faith preserves,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Choice food alone scorns to devour,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May justly claim this heavenly flower.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.89}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Said the priest, &ldquo;I am endued with these virtues,&rdquo; and had the flowers brought to him and he put them on, and then begged of the fourth Devaputta, who spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;He that good men will ne&rsquo;er attack</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When present, nor behind their back,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And all he says, fulfils in deed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This flower may claim as his due weed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The priest said: &ldquo;I am endued with these virtues,&rdquo; and he had the flowers brought to him and put them on. So these Devaputtas gave the four wreaths of flowers to the priest and returned to the world of gods. As soon as they were gone, the priest was seized with a violent pain in the head, as if it were being pounded by a sharp spike, or crushed by an <span class="t18">[3.60] </span><a id="a8474"></a>instrument of iron. Maddened with the pain he rolled up and down, and cried out with a loud voice. When men asked, &ldquo;What means this?&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I claimed these virtues when I had them not, and spoke falsely and so begged these flowers of the Devaputtas: take them from off my head.&rdquo; They would have removed them, but could not, for they were fastened as it were with an iron band. Then they raised him up and led him home. And as he lay there crying aloud, seven days passed. The king spake to his councillors and said: &ldquo;This wicked brahmin will die. What are we to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;let us again celebrate a festival. The Devaputtas will come back.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.90}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8475"></a>And the king held a festival, and the Devaputtas returned and filled all the city with the perfume of the flowers, and took their stand in the same place in the royal court. The people gathered together, and bringing that wicked brahmin they laid him down before the Devaputtas on his belly. He prayed the Devaputtas, saying: &ldquo;My lords, spare my life.&rdquo; The Devaputtas said: &ldquo;These flowers are not meet for a wicked and evil man. You thought in your heart to deceive us. You have received the reward of your false words.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">After thus rebuking him in the presence of the people, they removed the wreath of flowers from his head and having admonished the people, they returned to their own place of abode.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Devadatta was the brahmin, of the Devaputtas Kassapa was one, Moggallāna was another, Sāriputta a third, and I myself was the chief Devaputta of all.&rdquo;</span></p>

And when he was grown up, at his father&rsquo;s death he ruled. Kākātī was his chief queen and as lovely as a Devaccharā. <span class="t18">{3.91}</span><a id="a8493"></a> The old form of the legend will be found set forth in full in the Kunāḷajātaka [Ja 536].<a id="a8494"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15477"><span class="t9">{591}</span></a> Here follows a brief summary of it.</p>
<p class="p7">Now at this time a certain Garuḷa king came disguised as a man, and played at dice with the king of Benares. Falling in love with the chief queen Kākātī, he carried her off with him to the dwelling place of the Garuḷas and lived happily with her. The king missing her told his musician named Naṭakuvera to go in quest of her. He found the Garuḷa king lying on a bed of coarse grass in a certain lake, and just as the Garuḷa was on the point of leaving that spot, he seated himself in the midst of the royal bird&rsquo;s plumage,<a id="a8495"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15479"><span class="t9">{592}</span></a><a id="a8496"></a> and was in this way conveyed to the dwelling place of the Garuḷas. There he enjoyed the lady&rsquo;s favours, and again seating himself on the bird&rsquo;s wing returned home. And when the time came for the Garuḷa to play at dice with the king, the minstrel took his lute and going up to the gaming board he stood before the king, and in the form of a song gave utterance to the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Fragrant odours round me playing</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Breath of fair Kākātī&rsquo;s love,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From her distant home conveying</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thoughts my inmost soul to move.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the Garuḷa responded in a second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Sea and Kebuk stream defying</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Did you reach my island home?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Over seven oceans flying</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To the Simbal grove did come?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.92}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Naṭakuvera, on hearing this, uttered the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo; &rsquo;Twas through you all space defying</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I was borne to Simbal grove,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And o&rsquo;er seas and rivers flying</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas through you I found my love.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Garuḷa king replied in the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Out upon the foolish blunder,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What a senseless fool I have been!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lovers best were kept asunder,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lo! I&rsquo;ve served as go-between.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So the Garuḷa brought the queen and gave her back to the king of Benares, and came not there any more. <span class="t18">[3.62]</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Why should I shed tears.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while living at Jetavana, of a certain landowner who had lost his wife. On her death, they say, he neither washed himself nor took food, and neglected his farm duties. Overcome with grief he would wander about the cemetery lamenting, while the basis to enter the First Path blazed forth like a halo about his head. The Teacher, early one morning, casting his eye upon the world and beholding him said: &ldquo;Except for me there is no one that can remove this man&rsquo;s sorrow and bestow upon him the power of entering the First Path. I will be his refuge.&rdquo; So when he had returned from his rounds and had eaten his meal, he took an attendant monk and went to the door of the landowner&rsquo;s house. </span><span class="t18">{3.93}</span><span class="t30"> And he on hearing that the Teacher was coming went out to meet him, and with other marks of respect seated him in the prescribed seat and came and sitting on one side saluted him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher asked, &ldquo;Wherefore, lay brother, are you silent?&rdquo; &ldquo;Venerable sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am grieving for her.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher said: &ldquo;Lay brother, that which is breakable is broken, but when this happens, one ought not to grieve. Sages of old, when they lost a wife, knew this truth, and therefore sorrowed not.&rdquo; And then at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8505"></a><span class="t30">The old legend will be found set forth in the Cullabodhijātaka [Ja 443] in the Tenth Book. Here follows a short summary of it.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a brahmin family. And when he grew up, he studied all the arts at Taxila and then returned to his parents. In this birth the Great Being became a holy young student.</p>
<p class="p7">Then his parents told him they would look out a wife for him. &ldquo;I have no desire for a married life,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;When you are dead, I will adopt the ascetic life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8506"></a>But being greatly importuned by them, he had a golden image<a id="a8507"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15481"><span class="t9">{593}</span></a> made, <span class="t18">[3.63] </span><a id="a8508"></a><a id="a8509"></a><a id="a8510"></a>and said: &ldquo;If you can find me a maiden like unto this, I will take her to wife.&rdquo; His parents sent forth some emissaries with a large escort, and bade them place the golden image in a covered carriage and go and search through the plains of Jambudīpa, till they found just such a young brahmin girl, when they were to give this golden image in exchange, and bring the girl back with them. Now at this time a certain being passing from the Brahmā Realm was born again in the form of a young girl in a town in the kingdom of Kāsi, in the house of a brahmin worth eighty crores, and the name given her was Sammillabhāsinī. At the age of sixteen she was a fair and gracious maiden, like to a Devaccharā, endued with all the marks of female beauty. And since no thought of evil was ever suggested to her by the power of sinful passion, she was perfectly pure. <span class="t18">{3.94}</span></p>
<p class="p7">So the men took the golden image and wandered about till they reached this village. The inhabitants on seeing the image asked, &ldquo;Why is Sammillabhāsinī, the daughter of such and such a brahmin, placed there?&rdquo; The messengers on hearing this found the brahmin family, and chose Sammillabhāsinī for the prince&rsquo;s bride. She sent a message to her parents, saying: &ldquo;When you are dead, I shall adopt the ascetic life; I have no desire for the married state.&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;What are you thinking of, maiden?&rdquo; And accepting the golden image they sent off their daughter with a great retinue. The marriage ceremony took place against the wishes of both the Bodhisatta and Sammillabhāsinī. Though sharing the same room and the same bed they did not regard one another with the eye of sinful passion, but dwelt together like two monks or two Brahmās.</p>
<p class="p7">By and by the father and mother of the Bodhisatta died. He performed their funeral rites and calling to him Sammillabhāsinī, said to her, &ldquo;My dear, my family property amounts to eighty crores, and yours too is worth another eighty crores. Take all this and enter upon household life. I shall become an ascetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;if you become an ascetic, I will become one too. I cannot forsake you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Come then,&rdquo; he said. So spending all their wealth in generosity and throwing up their worldly fortune as it were a lump of phlegm, they journeyed into the Himālayas and both of them adopted the ascetic life. There after living for a long time on wild fruits and roots, they at length came down from the Himālayas to procure salt and vinegar, and gradually found their way to Benares, and dwelt in the royal grounds. And while they were living there, this young and delicate female ascetic, from eating insipid rice of a mixed quality, was attacked by dysentery and not being able to get any healing remedies, she grew very weak.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8511"></a>The Bodhisatta at the time for going his rounds to beg for alms, took hold of her and carried her to the gate of the city and there laid her on a bench in a certain hall, and himself went into the city for alms. He had scarce <span class="t18">[3.64] </span>gone out when she expired. The people, beholding the great beauty of this female ascetic, <span class="t18">{3.95}</span> thronged about her, weeping and lamenting. The Bodhisatta after going his round of begging returned, and hearing of her death he said: &ldquo;That which has the quality of dissolution is dissolved. All impermanent existences are of this kind.&rdquo; With these words he sat down on the bench whereon she lay and eating the mixture of food he rinsed out his mouth. The people that stood by gathered round him and said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, what was this female ascetic to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;When I was a layman,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;she was my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Venerable sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;while we weep and lament and cannot control our feelings, why do you not weep?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;While she was alive, she belonged to me in some sort. Nothing belongs to her that is gone to another world: she has passed into the power of others. Wherefore should I weep?&rdquo; And teaching the people the Dhamma, he recited these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Why should I shed tears for you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fair Sammillabhāsinī?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8512"></a><span class="t12">Passed to death&rsquo;s majority</span><a id="a8513"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15483"><span class="t19">{594}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You are henceforth lost to me.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Wherefore should frail man lament</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What to him is only lent?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He too draws his mortal breath</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Forfeit every hour to death.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Be he standing, sitting still,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Moving, resting, what he will,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In the twinkling of an eye,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In a moment death is nigh.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Life I count a thing unstable,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Loss of friends inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cherish all that are alive,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sorrow not should you survive.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.97}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being teach the Dhamma, illustrating by these four verses the impermanence of things. The people performed funeral rites over the female ascetic. And the Bodhisatta returned to the Himālayas, and entering upon Absorption and the Super Knowledges he was destined to birth in the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, revealed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths, the landowner attained to fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time the mother of Rāhula was Sammillabhāsinī, and I myself was the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>

For when Devadatta had unreasonably conceived a grudge against the Tathāgata and instigated a band of archers to slay him, his offence became known by the letting loose of the elephant Nālāgiri.</span><a id="a8522"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15485"><span class="t9">{595}</span></a><span class="t30"> Then men took away his office and the rations provided for him, and the king ceased to regard him. And having lost his source of gains and honour, he went about living on what he begged in noble families.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks started a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, how that Devadatta thought to get gain and honour, but when he had got it he could not keep it. The Teacher came and inquired what was the subject the monks sat in a meeting to discuss, and on being told what it was he said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but formerly too, Devadatta was deprived of gains and honour.&rdquo; And he then told them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Dhanañjaya was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta became a parrot named Rādha. He was a well-grown bird with perfectly-formed limbs. And his younger brother was called Poṭṭhapāda. A certain fowler trapped these two birds and brought them as a present to the king of Benares. The king put the pair in a golden cage <span class="t18">{3.98}</span> and took care of them and gave them honey and parched corn to eat in a golden dish and sugar-water to drink. Great attention was paid them, and they attained to the highest degree of profit and honour. Then a certain forester brought a big black monkey, called Kālabāhu, as a present to the king, and from the fact of his coming later than the parrots, he received still greater gain and respect, while that paid to the parrots fell off. The Bodhisatta through his possession of Buddha qualities said not a word, but his younger brother, from the absence of these qualities being unable to put up with the honour paid to the monkey, said: &ldquo;Brother, formerly in this royal house men gave us savoury food, but now we get nothing, and they offer it all to the monkey Kālabāhu. As we receive neither gain nor honour in this place from the king, what are we to do? Come, let us go and live in the forest.&rdquo; And as he talked with him, he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Once we enjoyed of food abundant store,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This monkey now has what was ours before.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come, Rādha, let us to the forest hie;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Such scurvy treatment what can justify?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.66]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Rādha, on hearing this, replied in the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Gain and loss and praise and blame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pleasure, pain, dishonour, fame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All as transient states conceive &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why should Poṭṭhapāda grieve?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.99}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, Poṭṭhapāda was unable to get rid of his grudge against the monkey and repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Rādha, wisest bird alive,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sure you knowest things to come,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This vile creature who shall drive</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From the court to his old home?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Rādha, on hearing this, uttered the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Oft will his puckered face and moving ears</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The royal children fill with foolish fears:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Soon Kālabāhu through some impish freak,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Far far away his food will have to seek.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">In a very short time the monkey by shaking his ears and similar tricks terrified the young princes. In their alarm they made an outcry. The king asked what it meant, and hearing the cause, said: &ldquo;Drive him away.&rdquo; So he had the monkey driven away, and the parrots were restored to their former condition of gain and honour. <span class="t18">{3.100}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher here ended his lesson and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Devadatta was Kālabāhu, Ānanda was Poṭṭhapāda, and I myself was Rādha.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Power on earth.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8530"></a><span class="t30"> This was a story told by the Teacher when at Jetavana, about a brahmin who was ever proving his virtue. Two similar stories have been told before.</span><a id="a8531"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15487"><span class="t9">{596}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8532"></a><a id="a8533"></a><a id="a8534"></a><span class="t34">This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a brahmin who put to the test his reputation for virtue. This brahmin, who was maintained by the king of Kosala, had sought the Three Refuges; he kept the Five Precepts, and was versed in the Three Vedas. &ldquo;This is a virtuous man,&rdquo; thought the king, and showed him great honour. But that brahmin thought to himself, &ldquo;The king shows honour to me beyond other brahmins, and has manifested his great regard by making me his spiritual director. But is his favour due to my virtue or only to my birth, lineage, family, country and accomplishments? I must clear this up without delay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Accordingly, one day when he was leaving the palace, he took without permission a coin from a treasurer&rsquo;s counter, and went his way. Such was the treasurer&rsquo;s veneration for the brahmin that he sat perfectly still and said not a word. Next day the brahmin took two coins; but still the official made no remonstrance. The third day the brahmin took a whole handful of coins. &ldquo;This is the third day,&rdquo; cried the treasurer, &ldquo;that you have robbed his majesty,&rdquo; and he shouted out three times, &ldquo;I have caught the thief who robs the treasury.&rdquo; In rushed a crowd of people from every side, crying, &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve long been posing as a model of virtue.&rdquo; And dealing him two or three blows, they led him before the king. In great sorrow the king said to him, &ldquo;What led you, brahmin, to do so wicked a thing?&rdquo; And he gave orders, saying: &ldquo;Off with him to punishment.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am no thief, sire,&rdquo; said the brahmin. &ldquo;Then why did you take money from the treasury?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because you showed me such great honour, sire, and because I made up my mind to find out whether that honour was paid to my birth and the like or only to my virtue. That was my motive, and now I know for certain (inasmuch as you order me off to punishment) that it was my virtue and not my birth and other advantages, that won me your majesty&rsquo;s favour.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Virtue I know to be the chief and supreme good; I know too that to virtue I can never attain in this life, while I remain a layman, living in the midst of sensual pleasures. Wherefore, this very day I would willingly go to the Teacher at Jetavana and renounce the world for the Saṅgha. Grant me your leave, sire.&rdquo; The king consenting, the brahmin set out for Jetavana. His friends and relations in a body tried to turn him from his purpose, but, finding their efforts of no avail, left him alone.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8535"></a><span class="t34">He came to the Teacher and asked to be admitted to the Saṅgha. After admission to the lower and higher ordination, he won by application insight and became an Arahat, whereon he drew near to the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;Sir, my joining the Saṅgha has borne the Supreme Fruit,&rdquo; thereby signifying that he had became an Arahat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Hearing of this, the monks, assembling in the Dhamma Hall, spoke with one another of the virtues of the king&rsquo;s family priest who tested his own reputation for virtue and who, leaving the king, had now risen to be an Arahat. Entering the Hall, the Teacher asked what the monks were discussing, and they told him. &ldquo;Not without a precedent, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the action of this brahmin in putting to the test his reputation for virtue and in working out his safety after renouncing the world. The like was done by the wise and good of bygone days as well.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was his family priest &ndash; a man given to generosity and other good works, whose mind was set on righteousness, always keeping unbroken the Five Precepts. And the king honoured him beyond the other brahmins; and everything came to pass as above. </span><span class="t35">[3.67]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In testing his virtue he for three days took a coin from the royal treasurer&rsquo;s board. They informed against him as a thief, and when brought before the king, he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Power on earth beyond compare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Virtue owns a wondrous charm:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Putting on a virtuous air</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Deadly snakes avoid all harm.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After thus praising virtue in the first verse, he gained the king&rsquo;s consent and adopted the ascetic life.</p>
<p class="p7">Now a hawk seized a piece of meat in a butcher&rsquo;s shop and darted up into the air. The other birds surrounded him and struck at him with feet, claws and beaks. Unable to bear the pain he dropped the piece of meat. Another bird seized it. It too in like manner being hard pressed let the meat fall. Then another bird pounced on it, and whosoever got the meat was pursued by the rest, and whosoever let it go was left in peace.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta on seeing this thought: &ldquo;These desires of ours are like pieces of meat. To those that grasp at them is sorrow, and to those that let them go is peace.&rdquo; And he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;While the hawk had aught to eat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Birds of prey pecked at him sore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When perforce he dropped the meat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then they pecked at him no more.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.101}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The ascetic going forth from the city, in the course of his journey came to a village, and at evening lay down in a certain man&rsquo;s house. Now a female slave there named Piṅgalā made an appointment with a man, saying: &ldquo;You are to come at such and such an hour.&rdquo; After she had bathed the feet of her master and his family, when they had lain down, she sat on the threshold, looking out for the coming of her lover, and passed the first and the middle watch, repeating to herself, &ldquo;Now he will be coming,&rdquo; but at daybreak, losing hope, she said: &ldquo;He will not come now,&rdquo; and lay down and fell asleep. The Bodhisatta seeing this happen said: &ldquo;This woman sat ever so long in the hope that her lover would come, but now that she knows he will not come, in her despair, she slumbers peacefully.&rdquo; And with the thought that while hope in a sinful world brings sorrow, despair brings peace, he uttered the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;The fruit of hope fulfilled is bliss;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How differs loss of hope from this?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though dull despair her hope destroys,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8536"></a><span class="t12">Lo! Piṅgalā calm sleep enjoys.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8537"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15489"><span class="t19">{597}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">Next day going forth from that village he entered into a forest, and beholding an ascetic seated on the ground and indulging in meditation he <span class="t18">[3.68] </span>thought: &ldquo;Both in this world and in the next there is no happiness beyond the bliss of meditation.&rdquo; And he repeated the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;In this world and in worlds to be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nought can surpass concentration:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To holy calm a devotee,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Himself unharmed, will none annoy.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.102}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then he went into the forest and adopted the ascetic life of a sage and developed the Absorptions and Super Knowledges, and became destined to birth in the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time I myself was the family priest.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;They that with speech inopportune.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8547"></a><a id="a8548"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher at Jetavana about Kokālika. The introductory story is told in full in the Takkārikajātaka [Ja 481].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">During one rainy season the two chief disciples, desiring to leave the multitude and to dwell apart, took leave of the Teacher, and went into the kingdom where Kokālika was. They repaired to the residence of Kokālika, and said this to him, &ldquo;Monk Kokālika, since for us it is delightful to dwell with you, and for you to dwell with us, we would abide here three months.&rdquo; &ldquo;How,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;will it be delightful for you to dwell with me?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;If you tell not a soul that the two chief disciples are dwelling here, we shall be happy, and that will be our delight in dwelling with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;And how is it delightful for me to dwell with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;We will teach the Dhamma to you for three months in your home, and we will discourse to you, and that will be your delight in dwelling with us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dwell here, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so long as you will,&rdquo; and he allotted a pleasant residence to them. There they dwelt in the fruition of the Attainments, and no man knew of their dwelling in that place.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When they had thus past the rains they said to him, &ldquo;Monk, now we have dwelt with you, and we will go to visit the Teacher,&rdquo; and asked his leave to go. He agreed, and went with them on the rounds for alms in a village over against the place where they were. After their meal the elders departed from the village. Kokālika leaving them, turned back and said to the people, &ldquo;Lay brethren, you are like brute animals. Here the two chief disciples have been dwelling for three months in the monastery opposite, and you knew nothing of it: now they are gone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did you not tell us, sir?&rdquo; the people asked.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8549"></a><span class="t34">Then they took ghee and oil and medicines, raiment and clothes, and approached the elders, saluting them and saying: &ldquo;Pardon us, sirs we knew not you were the chief disciples, we have learned it but today by the words of the venerable monk Kokālika. Pray have compassion on us, and receive these medicines and clothes.&rdquo; Kokālika went after the elders with them, for he thought: &ldquo;The elders are frugal, and content with little; they will not accept these things, and then they will be given to me.&rdquo; But the elders, because the gift was offered at the instigation of a monk, neither accepted the things themselves nor had them given to Kokālika. The lay folk then said: &ldquo;Sirs, if you will not accept these, come here once again to bless us.&rdquo; The elders promised, and proceeded to the Teacher&rsquo;s presence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now Kokālika was angry, because the elders neither accepted those things themselves, nor had them given to him. The elders, however, having remained a short while with the Teacher, each chose five hundred monks as their following, and with these thousand monks went on pilgrimage seeking alms, as far as Kokālika&rsquo;s country. The lay folk came out to meet them, and led them to the same monastery, and showed them great honour day by day.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Great was the store given them of clothes and of medicines. Those monks who went out with the elders dividing the garments gave of them to all the monks which had come, but to Kokālika gave none, neither did the elders give him any. Getting no clothes Kokālika began to abuse and revile the elders, &ldquo;Sāriputta and Moggallāna are full of wicked desire; they would not accept before what was offered them, but these things they do accept. There is no satisfying them, they have no regard for another.&rdquo; But the elders, perceiving that the man was harbouring evil on their account, set out with their followers to depart; nor would they return, not though the people begged them to stay yet a few days longer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then a young monk said: &ldquo;Where shall the elders stay, laymen? Your own particular elder does not wish them to stay here.&rdquo; Then the people went to Kokālika, and said: &ldquo;Sir, we are told you do not wish the elders to stay here. Go to! Either appease them and bring them back, or away with you and live elsewhere!&rdquo; In fear of the people this man went and made his request to the elders. &ldquo;Go back, monk,&rdquo; answered the elders, &ldquo;we will not return.&rdquo; So he, being unable to prevail upon them, returned to the monastery. Then the lay brethren asked him whether the elders had returned. &ldquo;I could not persuade them to return,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why not, monk?&rdquo; they asked. And then they began to think it must be no good monks would dwell there because the man did wrong, and they must get rid of him. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;do not stay here; we have nothing here for you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Thus dishonoured by them, he took bowl and robe and went to Jetavana. After saluting the Teacher, he said: &ldquo;Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna are full of wicked desire, they are in the power of wicked desires!&rdquo; The Teacher replied, &ldquo;Say not so, Kokālika; let your heart, Kokālika, have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna; learn that they are good monks.&rdquo; Kokālika said: &ldquo;You believe in your two chief disciples, sir; I have seen it with my own eyes; they have wicked desires, they have secrets within them, they are wicked men.&rdquo; So he said thrice (though the Teacher would have stayed him), then rose from his seat, and departed. Even as he went on his way there arose over all his body boils of the size of a mustard seed, which grew and grew to the size of a ripe seed of the wood apple tree, burst, and blood ran all over him. Groaning he fell by the gate of Jetavana, maddened with pain.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">A great cry arose, and reached even to the Brahmā Realm, &ldquo;Kokālika has reviled the two chief disciples!&rdquo; Then his spiritual teacher, the Brahmā Tudu by name, learning the fact, came with the intent of appeasing the elders, and said while poised in the air, &ldquo;Kokālika, a cruel thing this you have done; make your peace with the chief disciples.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who are you, brother?&rdquo; the man asked. &ldquo;Tudu Brahmā, is my name,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Have you not been declared by the Fortunate One,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;one of those who return not? That word means that such come not back to this earth. You will become a Yakkha upon a dunghill!&rdquo; Thus he upbraided the Mahābrahmā. And as he could not persuade the man to do as he advised, he replied to him, &ldquo;May you be tormented according to your own word.&rdquo; Then he returned to his abode of bliss. And Kokālika after dying was born again in the Lotus Hell. That he had been born there the great and mighty Brahmā told to the Tathāgata, and the Teacher told it to the monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">In the Dhamma Hall the monks talked of the man&rsquo;s wickedness, &ldquo;Monks, they say Kokālika reviled Sāriputta and Moggallāna, and by the words of his own mouth came to the Lotus Hell.&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and said he, &ldquo;What speak you of, monks, as you sit here?&rdquo; They told him. Then he said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that Kokālika was destroyed by his own word, and out of his own mouth was condemned to misery; it was the same before.&rdquo; And he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was his valued minister. Now the king was very talkative. Thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;I will put an end to his talkativeness,&rdquo; and went about looking for an apt illustration. So one day the king came to his garden and sat down on the royal slab of stone. Above his head was a mango tree and there in a crow&rsquo;s nest a black cuckoo had laid her egg and gone off. The female crow watched over that cuckoo&rsquo;s egg. By and by a young cuckoo came forth from it. The crow thinking it was her own offspring took care of it, bringing food for it in her beak.</p>
<p class="p7">The young bird while still unfledged uttered a cuckoo cry prematurely. The crow thought: &ldquo;This young bird even now utters a strange note. <span class="t18">{3.103}</span> What will it do, when it is older?&rdquo; And so she killed it by pecking it with her beak and threw it out of the nest, and it fell at the king&rsquo;s feet. The king asked the <span class="t18">[3.69]</span> Bodhisatta, &ldquo;What is the meaning of this, my friend?&rdquo; Thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;I am seeking for an illustration to teach the king a lesson, and now I have got one.&rdquo; So he said: &ldquo;Garrulous folk, Great king, who talk too much out of season, meet with a fate like this. This young cuckoo, sire, being fostered by the crow, while yet unfledged, uttered a premature cry. So the crow knew it was not her offspring and killed it by pecking it with her beak and threw it out of the nest. All those that are too talkative out of season, be they men or beasts, suffer like trouble.&rdquo; And with these words he recited these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;They that with speech inopportune offend</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like the young cuckoo meet untimely end.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Nor deadly poison, nor sharp-whetted sword</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is half so fatal as ill-spoken word.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. The sage his measured words discreetly guides,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor rashly to his second self confides:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Before he speaks will prudent counsel take,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His foes to trap, as Garuḷa the snake.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.104}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king, after hearing the Dhamma teaching of the Bodhisatta, thenceforth became more measured in his words, and increasing the glory of the Bodhisatta ever gave him more and more.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having brought his lesson to an end, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Kokālika in those days was the young cuckoo, and I myself was the wise minister.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Wounding another.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher when he was at Jetavana, about the family priest of the king of Kosala, who, it is said, as he was driving in his chariot to a village on his estate came upon a caravan in a narrow road, and crying out once and again, &ldquo;Out of the way with you,&rdquo; was so enraged at a cart not clearing out of his way that he threw his goad-stick at the driver of the first cart. The stick struck against the yoke of the chariot, and rebounding hit him on the forehead and raised a bump on his head. The priest turned back and went and told the king he had been wounded by some carters. The carters were summoned, and the judges examining into the case found the priest only was to blame.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day the matter was discussed in the Dhamma Hall, </span><span class="t18">[3.70] {3.105}</span><span class="t30"> how that the king&rsquo;s family priest, who said he had been assaulted by some carters, on going to law lost the suit. When the Teacher came and inquired what the monks were sitting in council to discuss, on hearing what it was he said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but formerly also this fellow acted in precisely the same way.&rdquo; And he then told them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta became his lord justice. The king&rsquo;s family priest drives to a village where he was headman, and acts in exactly the same way as in the introductory tale, but in this version, when the king heard the priest&rsquo;s story, he summoned the carters and himself sat in judgment, and without examining into the matter he said: &ldquo;You have beaten my priest and raised a bump on his forehead,&rdquo; and ordered all their property to be taken from them. Then said the Bodhisatta to him, &ldquo;Sire, without even investigating the matter you order them to be deprived of all their goods, but some men after inflicting wounds on themselves declare that they have been wounded by another. Therefore it is wrong for one who bears rule to act thus without trying the case. He ought not to act till he has heard everything.&rdquo; And then he recited these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8558"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Wounding another, his own wound he shows,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Himself the smiter, he complains of blows.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a8575"></a><span class="t30">According to the story he went to a village with his wife to retrieve a debt, and seizing a cart in satisfaction for what was due to him he deposited it with a certain family, intending to fetch it</span><span class="t54"> </span><span class="t30">later on.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">But in this case, as the husband and wife were returning home, after calling in a debt, in the course of their journey some hunters gave them a roasted lizard, bidding them both to eat of it. The man sent his wife to fetch water and ate up the whole lizard, and when she came back, he said: &ldquo;My dear, the lizard has run away.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, my lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what can one do with a roasted lizard that runs away?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.107}</span><span class="t30"> She drank some water and afterwards at Jetavana when sitting in the presence of the Teacher, she was asked by him as follows, &ldquo;Lay sister, is this man affectionate, loving and helpful to you?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;I am loving and affectionate to him, but he has no love for me.&rdquo; The Teacher said: &ldquo;Well, suppose he does behave thus to you. Do not be grieved. When he recalls to mind your virtues, he will give supreme power to you alone.&rdquo; And at their request he related a story about the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">This old story is just like the one given above, but in this case, as the husband and wife were on their way home, some hunters saw how distressed they were and gave them a roasted lizard and bade them share it between them. The royal lady tied it about with a creeper used as a string, and went on her way, carrying it in her hand. They came upon a lake, and leaving the high road sat down at the foot of a Bodhi tree. The prince said: &ldquo;Go, my dear, and fetch water from the lake in a lotus leaf, then we will eat this meat.&rdquo; She hung the lizard on a bough and went to fetch water. Her companion ate up all the lizard and then sat with averted face, holding the tip of the tail in his hand. When she returned with the water, he said: &ldquo;My dear, the lizard came down from the bough and made for an ant-heap. I ran and seized it by the tip of its tail. The lizard broke in two and left in my hand the part I had seized and disappeared in the hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, my lord,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;how can we deal with a roasted lizard that runs away? Come, let us be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And so drinking the water, they journey to Benares. The prince when he came to the throne gave her the titular rank of queen consort, but no honour or respect was paid to her. The Bodhisatta, desiring to win honour for her, standing in the king&rsquo;s presence asked her, &ldquo;Lady, is it not the case that we receive nothing at your hands? Why do you neglect us?&rdquo; <span class="t18">[3.72]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Dear sir,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;I get nothing from the king. How then should I give a present to you? What is the king likely to give me now? When we were coming from the forest, he ate a roasted lizard all by himself.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.108}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the king would not act after this sort. Do not speak thus of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the lady said to him, &ldquo;Sir, this is not clear to you, but it is clear enough to the king and me,&rdquo; and she repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Then were you first known to me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When in forest-depths, O king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Roasted lizard broke its string</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And from Bodhi tree branch got free.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though &rsquo;neath robe of bark, I think,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sword and coat of mail were seen.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus spake the queen, making known the king&rsquo;s offence in the midst of his courtiers. The Bodhisatta, on hearing her, said: &ldquo;Lady, ever since the time when your husband ceased to love you, why do you go on living here, making unpleasantness for both?&rdquo; and he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;To one that honours you, due honour show</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With full requital of good service done:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No kindness on illiberal folk bestow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor those affect that would your presence shun.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Forsake the wretch who has forsaken you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And love not one who has for you no love,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">E&rsquo;en as a bird forsakes a barren tree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And seeks a home in some far distant grove.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.109}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king, while the Bodhisatta was yet speaking, called to mind her virtues and said: &ldquo;My dear, ever so long I observed not your virtues, but through the words of this wise man, I have observed them. Bear with my offence. This whole realm of mine I give to you alone.&rdquo; And hereupon he spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Far as in his power may be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gratitude a king should show:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All my realm I grant to you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gifts, on whom you will, bestow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">With these words the king conferred on the queen supreme power, and thinking: &ldquo;It was by this man that I was reminded of her virtues,&rdquo; he gave great power to the wise man also.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having brought his lesson to an end, identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths, both husband and wife attained fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;The husband and wife of the present story played the same part in the old tale. But I myself was the wise minister.&rdquo;</span></p>

The introductory story will be found in full in the Tesakuṇajātaka [Ja 521].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8586"></a><a id="a8587"></a><a id="a8588"></a><a id="a8589"></a><span class="t34">This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told by way of admonition to the king of Kosala. Now this king came to hear the preaching of the Dhamma and the Teacher addressed him in the following terms, &ldquo;A king, sire, ought to rule his kingdom righteously, for whenever kings are unrighteous, then also are his officers unrighteous.&rdquo; And admonishing him in the right way... he pointed out the suffering and the blessing involved in following or abstaining from evil courses, and expounded in detail the misery resulting from sensual pleasures, comparing them to dreams and the like, saying: &ldquo;In the case of these men,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">No bribe can move relentless death, no kindness mollify,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">No one in fight can vanquish death. For all are doomed to die.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">But in this version of it the Teacher said: &ldquo;Kings of old, sire, hearkening to the words of the wise, ruled justly and attained to the heavenly world.&rdquo; And at the request of the king he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family. And when he came of age, he was trained in all the arts, and adopting the ascetic life he developed the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and took up his abode in a pleasant quarter of the Himālayas, living on wild fruits and roots.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8590"></a><a id="a8591"></a>At this time the king being anxious to find out his own defects, went about inquiring if there was any one who would tell him his faults. And not finding any one to speak to his dispraise, either within doors or without, either within the city or outside it, he wandered about the countryside in disguise, thinking: &ldquo;How will it be in the country?&rdquo; And not meeting with any one there to speak to his dispraise, and hearing men speak only of his merits, he thought: &ldquo;How will it be in the Himālayas region?&rdquo; And he went into the forest and wandered about till he reached the hermitage of the Bodhisatta, where after saluting him, and addressing him in a friendly manner he took a seat on one side. At that moment the Bodhisatta was eating some ripe figs which he had brought from the wood. They were luscious and sweet, like powdered sugar. He addressed the king and said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, pray eat this ripe fig and drink some water.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king did so, and asked the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Why, venerable sir, is this ripe fig so exceedingly sweet?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Venerable sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the king now exercises his rule with justice and equity. That is why it is so sweet.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.111}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;In the reign of an unjust king, does it lose its sweetness, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yes, venerable sir, in the time of unjust kings, oil, honey, molasses and the like, as well as wild roots and fruits, lose their sweetness and flavour, and not these only but the whole realm becomes bad and flavourless; but when the rulers are just, these things become sweet and full of flavour, and the whole realm recovers its tone and flavour.&rdquo; <span class="t18">[3.74]</span></p>
<p class="p7">The king said: &ldquo;It must be so, venerable sir,&rdquo; and without letting him know that he was the king, he saluted the Bodhisatta and returned to Benares. And thinking to prove the words of the ascetic, he ruled unjustly, saying to himself, &ldquo;Now I shall know all about it,&rdquo; and after the lapse of a short time he went back and saluting the Bodhisatta, sat respectfully on one side. The Bodhisatta using exactly the same words, offered him a ripe fig, which proved to be bitter to his taste. Finding it to be bitter he spat it out, saying: &ldquo;It is bitter, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Venerable sir, the king must be unjust, for when rulers are unjust, everything beginning with the wild fruits in the wood, lose all their sweetness and flavour.&rdquo; And hereupon he recited these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8592"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;The bull through floods a devious course will take,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8593"></a><span class="t12">The herd of cows all straggling in his wake:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. So if a leader tortuous paths pursue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To base ends will he guide the vulgar crew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And the whole realm an age of license rue.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. But if the bull a course direct should steer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The herd of cows straight follow in his rear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. So should their chief to righteous ways be true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The common folk injustice will eschew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And through the realm shall holy peace ensue.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.112}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king after hearing the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s exposition of the Dhamma, let him know he was the king and said: &ldquo;Venerable sir, formerly it was due to me alone that the figs were first sweet and then bitter, but now I will make them sweet again.&rdquo; Then he saluted the Bodhisatta and returned home, and ruling righteously restored everything to its original condition.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended his lesson, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the king, and I myself was the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Devadatta presumes to act the part of the Buddha, but gets hit in the chest, humiliating himself. The Buddha tells a story of a jackal who tried to pay the part of a lion and was crushed to death by an elephant.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the lion (sīha),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Jackal beware.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, about the attempt of Devadatta to imitate the Buddha. The incident that gave rise to the story has been told in full before.</span><a id="a8600"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15495"><span class="t9">{600}</span></a><a id="a8601"></a><span class="t30"> Here is a short summary of it. </span><span class="t18">[3.75]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8602"></a><span class="t30">When the Teacher asked Sāriputta what Devadatta did when he saw him, the elder replied, &ldquo;Sir, in imitating you he put a fan in my hand and lay down, and then Kokālika struck him on the breast with his knee: and so by imitating you he got into trouble.&rdquo; The Teacher said: &ldquo;This happened to Devadatta before,&rdquo; and being pressed by the elder, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as a young lion, and dwelt in a cave of the Himālayas, <span class="t18">{3.113}</span> and one day after killing a buffalo and eating of its flesh he took a draught of water and returned home. A jackal saw him, and being unable to escape lay down on his belly.</p>
<p class="p7">The lion said: &ldquo;What is the meaning of this, Mr. Jackal?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I would be your servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8603"></a>The lion said: &ldquo;Well, come on then,&rdquo; and conducting him to the place where he dwelt, day by day he brought him meat and fed him. When the jackal had grown fat on the lion&rsquo;s broken meat, one day a feeling of pride sprang up in him, and he drew near to the lion, and said: &ldquo;My lord, I am ever a hindrance to you. You constantly bring me meat and feed me. Today do you remain here. I will go and slay an elephant, and after eating my fill will bring some meat to you.&rdquo; Said the lion, &ldquo;Friend jackal, let not this seem good in your eyes. You are not sprung from a stock that feeds on the flesh of the elephants that it kills. I will kill an elephant and bring its flesh to you. The elephant surely is big of body. Do not undertake what is contrary to your nature, but hearken to my words.&rdquo; And hereupon he spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Jackal, beware!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His tusks are long.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">One of your puny race</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Would scarcely dare</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So huge and strong</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A beast as this to face.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The jackal, though forbidden by the lion, issued forth from the cave and thrice uttered the cry of a jackal. And looking to the base of the mountain, he spied a black elephant moving below, and thinking to fall on his head he sprang up and turning over in the air fell at the elephant&rsquo;s feet. The elephant lifting up his fore foot planted it on the jackal&rsquo;s head and smashed his skull to pieces. <span class="t18">{3.114}</span> The jackal lay there groaning, and the elephant went off trumpeting. The Bodhisatta came and standing on the top of the precipice saw how the jackal had met his death, and said: &ldquo;Through his pride was this jackal slain,&rdquo; and uttered three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;A jackal once assumed the lion&rsquo;s pride,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And elephant as equal foe defied.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Prone on the earth, while groans his bosom rent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He learned the rash encounter to repent. </span><span class="t18">[3.76]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Who thus should challenge one of peerless fame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor mark the vigour of his well-knit frame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Shares the sad fate that on the jackal came.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. But who the measure of his own power knows,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And nice discretion in his language shows,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">True to his duty lives and triumphs o&rsquo;er his foes.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.115}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Bodhisatta in these verses declare the duties proper to be done in this world.</p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a8615"></a><a id="a8616"></a><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about a dishonest monk. This man, even though dedicated to the dispensation that leads to safety, notwithstanding to gain life&rsquo;s necessaries fulfilled the threefold cheating practice [seeking requisites, seeking honour and hinting].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The monks brought to light all the evil parts in the man as they conversed together in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Such a one, monks, after he had dedicated himself to this dispensation which leads to safety, yet lives in deceit!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and would know what they talked of there. They told him. Said he, &ldquo;This is not now the first time; he was deceitful before,&rdquo; and so saying he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta became his minister and temporal and spiritual adviser. The king of Benares went against the king of Kosala with a large army, and coming to Sāvatthi, after a battle entered the city and took the king prisoner. Now the king of Kosala had a son, prince Chatta by name. He made his escape in disguise, and went to Taxila, where he acquired the three Vedas and the eighteen liberal arts. Then he left Taxila, and while still studying the practical uses of science he arrived at a certain border village. In a wood near this, five hundred ascetics dwelt in huts of leaves. The prince approached them, and with the idea of learning somewhat of them, he became an ascetic, and so acquired whatsoever knowledge they had to impart. By and by he became the leader of that band of disciples.</p>
<p class="p7">One day he addressed his company of holy men and asked them, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, why do you not go to the central region?&rdquo; <span class="t18">[3.77]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;in the central region are said to be living wise men. <span class="t18">{3.116}</span> They pose one with questions, call upon one to return thanks and to repeat a form of blessing, and reprove the incompetent. And therefore we are afraid to go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I will manage all this for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Then we will go,&rdquo; they said. And all of them taking their various requisites in due course reached Benares. Now the king of Benares, having got all the kingdom of Kosala into his possession, set up loyal officials as governors, and himself, having collected all their available treasure, returned with his spoil to Benares. And filling iron pots with it, he buried them in the royal garden, and then continued to live there. So these holy men spent the night in the king&rsquo;s garden, and on the morrow went into the city to beg alms, and came to the door of the palace. The king was so charmed with their behaviour that he called them up and made them sit on the dais and gave them rice and cakes, and till it was their meal-time asked them such and such questions. Chatta won the king&rsquo;s heart by answering all his questions, and at the close of the meal he offered up various forms of thanksgiving. The king was still more pleased, and exacting a promise from them he made them all stay in his garden.</p>
<p class="p7">Now Chatta knew a spell for bringing to light buried treasure, and while dwelling there he thought: &ldquo;Where can this fellow have put the money which belonged to my father?&rdquo; So repeating the spell and looking about him he discovered that it was buried in the garden. And thinking that with this money he would recover his kingdom also, he addressed the ascetics and said: &ldquo;Sirs, I am the son of the king of Kosala. When our kingdom was seized by the king of Benares, I escaped in disguise, and so far I have saved my life. But now I have got the property which belonged to my family. With this will I go and recover my kingdom. What will you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;We too will go with you,&rdquo; they replied.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; he said, and had some big leather sacks made, and at night digging a hole in the ground he pulled out the treasure-pots, <span class="t18">{3.117}</span> and putting the money into the sacks he had the pots filled with grass. Then he ordered the five hundred holy men and others as well to take the money, and fled to Sāvatthi. There he had all the king&rsquo;s officers seized, and recovering his kingdom he restored the walls, watch-towers and other works, and having thus made the city impregnable against the attack of any hostile king, he took up his abode there.</p>
<p class="p7">It was told to the king of Benares, &ldquo;The ascetics have carried off the treasure from your garden and are fled.&rdquo; He went to the garden and opening the pots found only grass in them. And by reason of his lost treasure great sorrow fell upon him. Going to the city he wandered about murmuring, &ldquo;Grass, grass,&rdquo; and no one could assuage his grief. Thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;The king is in <span class="t18">[3.78] </span>great trouble. He wanders to and fro, idly chattering. Except myself, no one has the power to drive away his sorrow. I will free him from his trouble.&rdquo; So one day while seated quietly with him, when the king began to chatter, he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Grass is still your constant cry;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who did take your grass away?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What your need of it, or why</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do you this word only say?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king, on hearing what he said, replied in a second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Chatta, holy man of fame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As it happened this way came:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Him alone to blame I hold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Substituting grass for gold.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.118}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta, on hearing this, uttered a third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Canny folk their rule should make,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Little give and much will take.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What he took was all his own,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What he left was grass alone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the king uttered the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Virtue follows no such rules,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">These are morals fit for fools.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Doubtful morals they must be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Learning too is vanity.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">While he thus blamed Chatta, the king by these words of the Bodhisatta was freed from his sorrow and ruled his kingdom righteously.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher here ended his lesson and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the cheating monk was the Brahāchatta, and I myself was the wise minister.&rdquo;</span></p>
