<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks are talking about how Devadatta had led his followers to destruction. The Buddha tells a story of how a monkey had offended against a minister, and how the leader of 500 monkeys had refused to listen to good advice to keep clear of men, and was destroyed along with his following.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the wise king of the monkeys (paṇḍitakapirājā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a9548"></a><span class="t15">Devadatta = the disobedient monkey (dubbacakapi),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Devadatta&rsquo;s followers = his followers (parisa).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Let not the wise man.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.218] </span><span class="t30">The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning Devadatta being swallowed up by the earth. Finding that the monks were talking about this in the Dhamma Hall, he said: &ldquo;Devadatta has not been destroyed with his company now for the first time; he was destroyed before,&rdquo; and he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in the womb of a monkey, and lived in the king&rsquo;s garden with a retinue of five hundred monkeys. <span class="t18">{3.356}</span> Devadatta was also born in the womb of a monkey, and lived there also with a retinue of five hundred monkeys. Then one day when the king&rsquo;s family priest had gone to the garden, bathed and adorned himself, one tricky monkey going ahead of him sat above the gateway arch of the garden, and let excrement fall on the priest&rsquo;s head as he went out. When the priest looked up, he let it fall again in his mouth. The priest turned back, saying in threat to the monkeys, &ldquo;Very well, I shall know how to deal with you,&rdquo; and went away after washing.</p>
<p class="p7">They told the Bodhisatta that he had been angry and threatened the monkeys. He made announcement to the thousand monkeys, &ldquo;It is not well to dwell near the habitation of the angry; let the whole troop of monkeys flee and go elsewhere.&rdquo; A disobedient monkey took his own retinue and did not flee, saying: &ldquo;I will see about it afterwards.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta took his own retinue and went to the forest.</p>
<p class="p7">One day a female slave pounding rice had put some rice out in the sun and a goat was eating it; getting a blow with a torch and running away on fire, he was rubbing himself on the wall of a grass-hut near an elephant-stable. The fire caught the grass-hut and from it the elephant-stable; in it the elephants&rsquo; backs were burnt, and the elephant doctors were attending the elephants.</p>
<p class="p7">The family priest was always going about watching for an opportunity of catching the monkeys. He was sitting in attendance on the king, and the king said: &ldquo;Sir, many of our elephants have been injured, and the elephant doctors do not know how to cure them; do you know any remedy?&rdquo; &ldquo;I do, great king.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Monkey&rsquo;s fat, great king.&rdquo; &ldquo;How shall we get it?&rdquo; &ldquo;There are many monkeys in the garden.&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;Kill monkeys in the garden and get their fat.&rdquo; The archers went and killed five hundred monkeys with arrows.</p>
<p class="p7">One old <span class="t18">[3.219] </span>monkey fled although wounded by an arrow, and though he did not fall on the spot, <span class="t18">{3.357}</span> he fell when he came to the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s place of abode. The monkeys said: &ldquo;He has died when he reached our place of abode,&rdquo; and told the Bodhisatta that he was dead from a wound he had got. He came and sat down among the assembly of monkeys, and spoke these verses by way of exhorting the monkeys with the exhortation of the wise, which is, &ldquo;Men dwelling near their enemies perish in this way,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Let not the wise man dwell where dwells his foe;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">One night, two nights, so near will bring him woe.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. A fool&rsquo;s a foe to all who trust his word;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">One monkey brought distress on all the herd.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. A foolish chief, wise in his own conceit,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Comes ever, like this monkey, to defeat.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. A strong fool is not good to guard the herd,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Curse to his kindred, like the decoy-bird.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. One strong and wise is good the herd to guard,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like Sakka to the Gods, his kin&rsquo;s reward.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Who virtue, wisdom, learning, does possess,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His deeds himself and other men will bless.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Therefore virtue, knowledge, learning, and himself let him regard,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Either be a lonely saint or o&rsquo;er the flock keep watch and ward.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.358}</span></p>
<p class="p6">So the Great Being, having become king of monkeys, explained the way of learning the discipline.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the disobedient monkey was Devadatta, his troop was Devadatta&rsquo;s company and the wise king was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a9556"></a><span class="t15">Alternative Title: Bakajātaka (Cst)</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Baka Brahmā holds that his present existence is permanent. The Buddha tells how this view arose in the Brahmā, and then tells a story of how he attained his present glory by good deeds in the past.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the young brahmin Kappa (Kappamāṇava),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Bakabrahmā = the ascetic Kesava (Kesavatāpasa).</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Seventy and two.&rdquo;</span><a id="a9560"></a><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the Brahmā</span><a id="a9561"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15640"><span class="t9">{668}</span></a><span class="t30"> Baka. In him a false Dhamma arose, namely, &ldquo;This present existence is perpetual, permanent, eternal, unchanging; apart from it there is no escape or release at all.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7">In a former birth this Brahmā had once <span class="t18">[3.220]</span><span class="t23"> </span>practised meditation, so he was born in the Vehapphala heaven. Having spent there an existence of five hundred kalpas, he was born in the Subhakiṇṇa heaven; after sixty-four kalpas there he passed and was born in the Ābhassara heaven, where existence is for eight kalpas. It was there that this false Dhamma arose in him. He forgot that he had passed from higher Brahmaloka heavens and had been born in that heaven, and perceiving neither of these things had taken up the false Dhamma.</p>
<p class="p7">The Lord, understanding his reflections, <span class="t18">{3.359}</span><a id="a9562"></a> as easily as a strong man can extend his bent arm or bend his extended arm, disappearing from Jetavana, appeared in that Brahmaloka. The Brahmā, seeing the Lord, said: &ldquo;Come here, my lord; welcome, my lord; it is a long time, my lord, since you have taken this opportunity, even for coming here; this world, my lord, is perpetual, it is permanent, it is eternal, it is absolute, it is unchanging; this world is not born, it decays not, it dies not, it passes not away, it is not born again; apart from this world there is no other escape beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">When this was said, the Lord said to Baka the Brahmā, &ldquo;Baka the Brahmā has come to ignorance, he has come to ignorance, when he will say that a thing which is not permanent is permanent, and so on, and that there is no other escape apart from this when there is another escape.&rdquo; Hearing this the Brahmā thought: &ldquo;This one presses me hard, finding out exactly what I say,&rdquo; and as a timid thief, after receiving a few blows, says, &ldquo;Am I the only thief? So and so and so and so are thieves too,&rdquo; showing his associates; so he, in fear of the Lord&rsquo;s questioning, showing that others were his associates, spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Seventy and two, O Gotama, are we</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Righteous and great, from birth and age we&rsquo;re free;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Our heaven is wisdom&rsquo;s home, there&rsquo;s nought above;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And many others will this view approve.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing his words, the Teacher spoke the second verse: <span class="t18">{3.360}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Short your existence in this world; &rsquo;tis wrong,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Baka, to think existence here is long;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A hundred thousand aeons past and gone</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All your existence well to me is known.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, Baka spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Of wisdom infinite, O Lord, am I;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Birth, age, and sorrow, all beneath me lie;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What should I do with good works, long ago?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet tell me something, Lord, that I should know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Lord, relating and showing him things of past time, spoke four verses;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;To many a man of old you gave a drink</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For thirst and parching drought ready to sink;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That virtuous deed of thine so long ago</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Remembering, as if waked from sleep, I know. </span><span class="t18">{3.361}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. By Eṇi&rsquo;s bank you set the people free</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When chained and held in close captivity;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That virtuous deed of thine so long ago</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Remembering, as if waked from sleep, I know.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. By Ganges&rsquo; stream the man you did set free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whose boat was seized by Nāga, cruelly</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lusting for flesh, and save him mightily;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That virtuous deed of thine, so long ago</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Remembering, as if waked from sleep, I know. </span><span class="t18">[3.221]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t55">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. And I was Kappa, your disciple true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your wisdom and your virtues all I knew;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And now those deeds of thine so long ago</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Remembering, as if waked from sleep, I know.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.363}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing his own deeds from the Teacher&rsquo;s discourse, Baka gave thanks and spoke this last verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;You know every life that has been mine;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Buddha you are, all wisdom sure is thine;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And sure your glorious majesty and state</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Even this Brahmā Realm illuminate.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">So the Teacher, making known his quality as Buddha and expounding the Dhamma, showed forth the Truths. At the end the thoughts of ten thousand Brahmās were freed from attachments and defilements. So the Lord became the refuge of many Brahmās, and going back from Brahmaloka to Jetavana preached the Dhamma in the way described and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Baka the Brahmā was the ascetic Kesava, Kappa the disciple was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks store up medicines and are reproved for it by the lay folk. The Buddha tells a story of two kings who gave up their kingdoms to become ascetics, and how, when one had a slight fault, and the other reproved him for it, he took him for teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a9568"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the king of Gandhāra (Gandhārarājā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Ānanda = (the king of) Vedeha.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9569"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Renunciation, Asceticism.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Villages full sixteen thousand.&rdquo;</span><a id="a9570"></a><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this when dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the precept on the storing up of medicines.</span><a id="a9571"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15642"><span class="t9">{669}</span></a><a id="a9572"></a><a id="a9573"></a><span class="t30"> The occasion however arose in Rājagaha. When the venerable Pilindiyavaccha went to the king&rsquo;s dwelling to set free the park-keeper&rsquo;s family,</span><a id="a9574"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15644"><span class="t9">{670}</span></a><a id="a9575"></a><span class="t30"> he made the palace all of gold by his Supernormal Powers; and the people in their delight brought to that elder the five kinds of medicine. He gave them away to the Saṅgha. So the Saṅgha abounded in medicines, </span><span class="t18">{3.364}</span><a id="a9576"></a><span class="t30"> and as they received the medicines, they filled pots and jars and bags in this way and laid them aside. People seeing this murmured, saying: &ldquo;Those greedy monastics are hoarding in their houses.&rdquo; The Teacher, hearing this thing, declared the precept, &ldquo;Whatever medicines for sick monks (are received, must be used within seven days),&rdquo; and said: &ldquo;Monks, wise men of old, before the Buddha appeared, ordained in an outside sect and keeping only the five precepts, used to chide those who laid aside even grains of salt for the next day; but you, though ordained in such a dispensation which leads to safety, make a hoard for the second and the third day,&rdquo; and so he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past the Bodhisatta was the king&rsquo;s son of the Gandhāra kingdom; at his father&rsquo;s death he became king and ruled with righteousness.<span class="t18"> [3.222]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the Central Region, in the kingdom of Videha a king named Videha was ruling at the time. These two kings had never seen each other, but they were friends and had great trust the one in the other. At that time men were long-lived; their life was for thirty thousand years.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9577"></a>Then once, on the fast day of the full moon, the king of Gandhāra had taken the precepts,<a id="a9578"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15646"><span class="t9">{671}</span></a> and on the dais in the middle of a royal throne prepared for him, looking through an open window on the eastern quarter, he sat giving to his ministers a discourse on the substance of the Dhamma. At that moment Rāhu was covering the moon&rsquo;s orb which was full and spreading over the sky. The moon&rsquo;s light vanished. The ministers, not seeing the moon&rsquo;s brightness, told the king that the moon was seized by Rāhu. The king, observing the moon, thought: &ldquo;That moon has lost its light, being marred by some trouble from outside; now my royal retinue is a trouble, and it is not meet that I should lose my light like the moon seized by Rāhu; I will leave my kingdom like the moon&rsquo;s orb shining in a clear sky and become an ascetic; why should I admonish another? I will go about, detached from kin and people, admonishing myself alone; that is meet for me.&rdquo; So he said: &ldquo;As you please <span class="t18">{3.365}</span><a id="a9579"></a><a id="a9580"></a> so do,&rdquo; and gave over the kingdom to his ministers. When he gave up his kingdom in the two kingdoms of Kashmir and Gandhāra, he took the ascetic life, and attaining the Absorptions and Super Knowledges he passed the rains in the Himālayas region devoted to the delight of Absorption.</p>
<p class="p7">The king of Videha, having asked of merchants, &ldquo;Is it well with my friend?&rdquo; heard that he had taken the ascetic life, and thought: &ldquo;When my friend has taken the ascetic life, what should I do with a kingdom?&rdquo; So he gave up the rule in his city of Mithila, seven leagues in extent, and his kingdom of Videha, three hundred leagues in extent, with sixteen thousand villages, storehouses filled, and sixteen thousand dancing girls, and without thinking of his sons and daughters he went to the Himālayas region and took the ascetic life. There he lived on fruits only, dwelling in a state of quietude.</p>
<p class="p7">Both of them following this quiet life afterwards met, but did not recognise each other; yet they lived together in this quiet life in friendliness. The ascetic of Videha waited upon the ascetic of Gandhāra. On a day of full moon as they were sitting at the root of a tree and talking on things relating to the Dhamma, Rāhu covered the moon&rsquo;s orb as it was shining in the sky. The ascetic of Videha looked up, saying: &ldquo;Why is the moon&rsquo;s light destroyed?&rdquo; And seeing that it was seized by Rāhu, he asked, &ldquo;Teacher, why has he covered the moon and made it dark?&rdquo; &ldquo;Scholar, that is the moon&rsquo;s one trouble, Rāhu by name; he hinders it from shining; I, seeing the moon&rsquo;s orb struck by Rāhu, thought, &lsquo;There is the moon&rsquo;s pure orb become dark by trouble from outside; now this kingdom is a trouble to <span class="t18">[3.223] </span>me; I will take the ascetic life so that the kingdom does not make me dark as Rāhu does the moon&rsquo;s orb;&rsquo; and so taking the moon&rsquo;s orb seized by Rāhu as my theme, I forsook my great kingdom and took the ascetic life.&rdquo; &ldquo;Teacher, were you king of Gandhāra?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.366}</span> &ldquo;Yes, I was.&rdquo; &ldquo;Teacher, I was the king Videha in the kingdom of Videha and city of Mithila; were we not friends though we never saw each other?&rdquo; &ldquo;What was your theme?&rdquo; &ldquo;I heard that you had taken the ascetic life and thinking, &lsquo;Surely he has seen the good of that life,&rsquo; I took you as my theme, and leaving my kingdom took the ascetic life.&rdquo; From that time they were exceedingly intimate and friendly, and lived on fruits only.</p>
<p class="p7">After a long time&rsquo;s dwelling there they came down from the Himālayas for salt and vinegar, and came to a frontier village. The people, being pleased with their behaviour, gave them alms and taking a promise made for them houses for the night and the like in the forest, and made them dwell there, and built by the road a room for taking their meals in a pleasant watered spot. They, after going their rounds for alms in the frontier village, sat and ate the alms in that hut of leaves and then went to their dwelling-house.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9581"></a>The people who gave them food one day put salt on a leaf and gave it them, another day gave them saltless food. One day they gave them a great deal of salt in a leaf basket. The ascetic of Videha took the salt, and coming gave enough to the Bodhisatta at the meal time and took to himself the proper measure; then putting up the rest in a leaf basket he put it in a roll of grass, saying: &ldquo;This will do for a saltless day.&rdquo; Then one day when saltless food was received, the man of Videha, giving the alms-food to the man of Gandhāra, took the salt from the roll of grass and said: &ldquo;Teacher, take salt.&rdquo; &ldquo;The people gave no salt today, where have you got it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Teacher, the people gave much salt one day before; then I kept what was over, saying, &lsquo;This will do for a saltless day.&rsquo; &rdquo; Then the Bodhisatta chided him, saying: &ldquo;O foolish man, you forsook the kingdom of Videha, three hundred leagues in extent, took the ascetic life and attained freedom from attachments, and now you get a desire for grains of salt.&rdquo; And so admonishing him he spoke the first verse: <span class="t18">{3.367}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Villages full sixteen thousand with their wealth you threw away,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Treasuries with wealth in plenty; and you&rsquo;re hoarding here today!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Videha, being thus chidden, did not endure the chiding but became estranged, saying: &ldquo;Teacher, you see not your own fault, though you see mine; did you not leave your kingdom and become an ascetic, saying, &lsquo;Why should I admonish another? I will admonish myself alone;&rsquo; why then are you now admonishing me?&rdquo; So he spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Kandahar and all its province, all its wealth, you threw away,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Giving no more royal orders; and you&rsquo;re ordering me today!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.224]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing him the Bodhisatta spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;It is righteousness I&rsquo;m speaking, for I hate unrighteousness;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Righteousness when I am speaking, wrong on me leaves no impress.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The ascetic of Videha, hearing the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s words, said: &ldquo;Teacher, it is not proper for one to speak after annoying and angering another, even though he speaks to the point; <span class="t18">{3.368}</span> you are speaking very harshly to me, as if shaving me with blunt steel,&rdquo; and so he spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Whatsoever words, if spoken, would to others cause offence,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wise men leave those words unspoken, though of mighty consequence.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta spoke the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Let my hearer scatter chaff, or let him take offence or not,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Righteousness when I am speaking, wrong on me can leave no spot.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9582"></a>Having so said, he went on, &ldquo;I will not work with you, O Ānanda,<a id="a9583"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15648"><span class="t9">{672}</span></a> as a potter with raw clay only; I will speak chiding again and again; what is truth, that will abide.&rdquo; And so being steadfast in conduct suitable to that Sugata&rsquo;s discourse, as a potter among his vessels, after beating them often, takes not the raw clay, but takes the baked vessel only, so preaching and chiding again and again he takes a man like a good vessel, and preaching to show him this, he spoke this pair of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Were not wisdom and good conduct trained in some men&rsquo;s lives to grow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Many would go wandering idly like the blinded buffalo.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. But since some are wisely trained in moral conduct fair to grow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus it is that disciplined in paths of virtue others go.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.369}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, the Videhan ascetic said: &ldquo;Teacher, from this time admonish me; I spoke to you with peevish temper, pardon me,&rdquo; and so paying respect he gained the Great Being&rsquo;s pardon. So they dwelt together in peace and went again to the Himālayas. Then the Bodhisatta told the Videhan ascetic how to focus on the Meditation Object. He did so and reached the Absorptions and Super Knowledges. So both, never leaving off meditation, became destined for the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the Videhan ascetic was Ānanda, the Gandhāra king was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a9595"></a><span class="t34">At Sāvatthi in the house of Anāthapiṇḍika there was always unfailing food for five hundred monks, and the same with Visākhā and the king of Kosala. But in the king&rsquo;s palace, various and fine as was the fare given, no one was friendly to the monks. The result was that the monks never ate in the palace, but they took their food and went off to eat it at the house of Anāthapiṇḍika or Visākhā or some other of their trusted friends.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">One day the king said: &ldquo;A present has been brought; take this to the monks,&rdquo; and sent it to the refectory. An answer was brought that no monks were there in the refectory. &ldquo;Where are they gone?&rdquo; he asked. They were sitting in their friends&rsquo; houses to eat, was the reply. So the king after his morning meal came into the Teacher&rsquo;s presence, and asked him, &ldquo;Good sir, what is the best kind of food?&rdquo; &ldquo;The food of friendship is the best, great king,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;even sour rice-gruel given by a friend becomes sweet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, sir, and with whom do the monks find friendship?&rdquo; &ldquo;With their kindred, great king, or with the Sakya families.&rdquo; Then the king thought, what if he were to make a Sakya girl his queen-consort; then the monks would be his friends, as it were with their own kindred.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So rising from his seat, he returned to the palace, and sent a message to Kapilavatthu to this effect, &ldquo;Please give me one of your daughters in marriage, for I wish to become connected with your family.&rdquo; On receipt of this message the Sakyas gathered together and deliberated. &ldquo;We live in a place subject to the authority of the king of Kosala; if we refuse a daughter, he will be very angry, and if we give her, the custom of our clan will be broken. What are we to do?&rdquo; Then Mahānāma said to them, &ldquo;Do not trouble about it. I have a daughter, named Vāsabhakhattiyā. Her mother is a slave woman, Nāgamuṇḍā by name; she is some sixteen years of age, of great beauty and auspicious prospects, and by her father&rsquo;s side noble. We will send her, as a girl nobly born.&rdquo; The Sakyas agreed, and sent for the messengers, and said they were willing to give a daughter of the clan, and that they might take her with them at once. But the messengers reflected: &ldquo;These Sakyas are desperately proud, in matters of birth. Suppose they should send a girl who was not of them, and say that she was so? We will take none but one who eats along with them.&rdquo; So they replied, &ldquo;Well, we will take her, but we will take one who eats along with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Sakyas assigned a lodging for the messengers, and then wondered what to do. Mahānāma said: &ldquo;Now do not trouble about it; I will find a way. At my mealtime bring in Vāsabhakhattiyā dressed up in her finery; then just as I have taken one mouthful, produce a letter, and say, &lsquo;My lord, such a king has sent you a letter; be pleased to hear his message at once.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">They agreed; and as he was taking his meal they dressed and adorned the maid. &ldquo;Bring my daughter,&rdquo; said Mahānāma, &ldquo;and let her take food with me.&rdquo; &ldquo;In a moment,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;as soon as she is properly adorned,&rdquo; and after a short delay they brought her in. Expecting to take food with her father, she dipped her hand into the same dish. Mahānāma had taken one mouthful with her, and put it in his mouth; but just as he stretched out his hand for another, they brought him a letter, saying: &ldquo;My lord, such a king has sent a letter to you; be pleased to hear his message at once.&rdquo; Said Mahānāma, &ldquo;Go on with your meal, my dear,&rdquo; and holding his right hand in the dish, with his left took the letter and looked at it. As he examined the message the maiden went on eating. When she had eaten, he washed his hand and rinsed out his mouth. The messengers were firmly convinced that she was his daughter, for they did not divine the secret.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So Mahānāma sent away his daughter in great pomp. The messengers brought her to Sāvatthi, and said that this maiden was the true-born daughter of Mahānāma. The king was pleased, and caused the whole city to be decorated, and placed her upon a pile of treasure, and by a ceremonial sprinkling made her his chief queen. She was dear to the king, and beloved.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">In a short time the queen conceived, and the king caused the proper treatment to be used; and at the end of ten months, she brought forth a son whose colour was a golden brown. On the day of his naming, the king sent a message to his grandmother, saying: &ldquo;A son has been born to Vāsabhakhattiyā, daughter of the Sakya king; what shall his name be?&rdquo; Now the courtier who was charged with this message was slightly deaf; but he went and told the king&rsquo;s grandmother. When she heard it, she said: &ldquo;Even when Vāsabhakhattiyā had never borne a son, she was more than all the world; and now she will be the king&rsquo;s darling.&rdquo; The deaf man did not hear the word, &ldquo;darling&rdquo; aright, but thought she said: &ldquo;Viḍūḍabha,&rdquo; so back he went to the king, and told him that he was to name the prince Viḍūḍabha. This, the king thought, must be some ancient family name, and so named him Viḍūḍabha. After this the prince grew up and was treated as a prince should be.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When he was at the age of seven years, having observed how the other princes received presents of toy elephants and horses and other toys from the family of their mothers&rsquo; fathers, the lad said to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, the rest of them get presents from their mothers&rsquo; family, but no one sends me anything. Are you an orphan?&rdquo; Then she replied, &ldquo;My boy, your grandfathers are the Sakya kings, but they live a long way off, and that is why they send you nothing.&rdquo; Again when he was sixteen, he said: &ldquo;Mother, I want to see your father&rsquo;s family.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it, child,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What will you do when you get there?&rdquo; But though she put him off, he asked her again and again. At last his mother said: &ldquo;Well, go then.&rdquo; So the lad got his father&rsquo;s consent, and set out with a number of followers. Vāsabhakhattiyā sent on a letter before him to this effect, &ldquo;I am living here happily; let not my masters tell him anything of the secret.&rdquo; But the Sakyas, on hearing of the coming of Viḍūḍabha, sent off all their young children into the country. &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;to receive him with respect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When the prince arrived at Kapilavatthu, the Sakyas had assembled in the royal rest-house. The prince approached the rest house, and waited. Then they said to him, &ldquo;This is your mother&rsquo;s father, this is her brother,&rdquo; pointing them out. He walked from one to the other, saluting them. But although he bowed to them till his back ached, not one of them vouchsafed a greeting; so he asked, &ldquo;Why is it that none of you greet me?&rdquo; The Sakyas replied, &ldquo;My dear, the youngest princes are all in the country,&rdquo; then they entertained him grandly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">After a few days stay, he set out for home with all his retinue. Just then a slave woman washed the seat which he had used in the rest house with milk-water, saying insultingly, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the seat where sat the son of Vāsabhakhattiyā, the slave girl!&rdquo; A man who had left his spear behind was just fetching it, when he overheard the abuse of prince Viḍūḍabha. He asked what it meant. He was told that Vāsabhakhattiyā was born of a slave to Mahānāma the Sakya. This he told to the soldiers; a great uproar arose, all shouting, &ldquo;Vāsabhakhattiyā is a slave woman&rsquo;s daughter, so they say!&rdquo; The prince heard it. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;let them pour milk-water over the seat I sat in, to wash it! When I am king, I will wash the place with the blood of the hearts!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When he returned to Sāvatthi, the courtiers told the whole matter to the king. The king was enraged against the Sakyas for giving him a slave&rsquo;s daughter to marry. He cut off all allowances made to Vāsabhakhattiyā and her son, and gave them only what is proper to be given to slave men and women.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9596"></a><span class="t34">Some few days later the Teacher came to the palace, and took a seat. The king approached him, and with a greeting said: &ldquo;Sir, I am told that your clansmen gave me a slave&rsquo;s daughter to marry. I have cut off their allowances, mother and son, and grant them only what slaves would get.&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;The Sakyas have done wrong, O great king! If they gave any one, they ought to have given a girl of their own blood. But, O king, this I say; Vāsabhakhattiyā is a king&rsquo;s daughter, and in the house of a noble king she has received the ceremonial sprinkling; Viḍūḍabha too was begotten by a noble king. Wise men of old have said, what matters the mother&rsquo;s birth? The birth of the father is the measure; and to a poor wife, a picker of sticks, they gave the position of queen consort; and the son born of her obtained the sovereignty of Benares, twelve leagues in extent, and became king Kaṭṭhavāhana, the wood-carrier,&rdquo; whereupon he told him the story of the Kaṭṭhahārijātaka [Ja 7].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When the king heard this speech he was pleased; and saying to himself, &ldquo;The father&rsquo;s birth is the measure of the man,&rdquo; he again gave mother and son the treatment suited to them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now the king&rsquo;s commander-in-chief was a man named Bandhula. His wife, Mallikā, was barren, and he sent her away to Kusināra, telling her to return to her own family. &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;when I have saluted the Teacher.&rdquo; She went to Jetavana, and greeting the Tathāgata stood waiting on one side. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked. She replied, &ldquo;My husband has sent me home, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the Teacher. &ldquo;I am barren, sir, I have no son.&rdquo; &ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is no reason why you should go. Return.&rdquo; She was much pleased, and saluting the Teacher went home again. Her husband asked her why she had come back. She answered, &ldquo;The One with Ten Powers sent me back, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the commander-in-chief, &ldquo;the Tathāgata must have seen good reason.&rdquo; The woman soon after conceived, and when her cravings began, told him of it. &ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I desire to go and bathe and drink the water of the tank in Vesāli City where the families of the kings get water for the ceremonial sprinkling.&rdquo; The commander-in-chief promised to try. Seizing his bow, strong as a thousand bows, he put his wife in a chariot, and left Sāvatthi, and drove his chariot to Vesālī.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now at this time there lived close to the gate a Licchavi named Mahāli, who had been educated by the same teacher as the king of Kosala&rsquo;s general, Bandhula. This man was blind, and used to advise the Licchavis on all matters temporal and spiritual. Hearing the clatter of the chariot as it went over the threshold, he said: &ldquo;The noise of the chariot of Bandhula the Mallian! This day there will be fear for the Licchavis!&rdquo; By the tank there was set a strong guard, within and without; above it was spread an iron net; not even a bird could find room to get through. But the general, dismounting from his carriage, put the guards to flight with the blows of his sword, and burst through the iron network, and in the tank bathed his wife and gave her to drink of the water; then after bathing himself, he set Mallikā in the chariot, and left the town, and went back by the way he came.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The guards went and told all to the Licchavis. Then were the kings of the Licchavis angry; and five hundred of them, mounted in five hundred chariots, departed to capture Bandhula the Mallian. They informed Mahāli of it, and he said: &ldquo;Go not! For he will slay you all.&rdquo; But they said: &ldquo;Nay, but we will go.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then if you come to a place where a wheel has sunk up to the nave, you must return. If you return not then, return back from that place when you hear the noise of a thunderbolt. If then you turn not, turn back from that place where you shall see a hole in front of your chariots. Go no further!&rdquo; But they did not turn back according to his word, but pursued on and on.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Mallikā espied them and said: &ldquo;There are chariots in sight, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then tell me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when they all look like one chariot.&rdquo; When they all in a line looked like one, she said: &ldquo;My lord, I see as it were the head of one chariot.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take the reins, then,&rdquo; said he, and gave the reins into her hand; he stood upright in the chariot, and strung his bow. The chariot-wheel sank into the earth nave-deep. The Licchavis came to the place, and saw it, but turned not back. The other went on a little further, and twanged the bow string; then came a noise as the noise of a thunderbolt, yet even then they turned not, but pursued on and on. Bandhula stood up in the chariot and sped a shaft, and it cleft the heads of all the five hundred chariots, and passed right through the five hundred kings in the place where the girdle is fastened, and then buried itself in the earth. As they did not perceive that they were wounded they pursued still, shouting, &ldquo;Stop, holloa, stop!&rdquo; Bandhula stopped his chariot, and said: &ldquo;You are dead men, and I cannot fight with the dead.&rdquo; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;dead, such as we now are?&rdquo; &ldquo;Loose the girdle of the first man,&rdquo; said Bandhula.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">They loosed his girdle, and at the instant the girdle was loosed, he fell dead. Then he said to them, &ldquo;You are all of you in the same condition; go to your homes, and set in order what should be ordered, and give your directions to your wives and families, and then doff your armour.&rdquo; They did so, and then all of them gave up the ghost.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">And Bandhula conveyed Mallikā to Sāvatthi. She bore twin sons sixteen times in succession, and they were all mighty men and heroes, and became perfected in all manner of accomplishments. Each one of them had a thousand men to attend him, and when they went with their father to wait on the king, they alone filled the courtyard of the palace to overflowing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">One day some men who had been defeated in court on a false charge, seeing Bandhula approach, raised a great outcry, and informed him that the judges of the court had supported a false charge. So Bandhula went into the court, and judged the case, and gave each man his own. The crowd uttered loud shouts of applause. The king asked what it meant, and on hearing was much pleased; all those officers he sent away, and gave Bandhula charge of the judgement court, and thenceforward he judged aright. Then the former judges became poor, because they no longer received bribes, and they slandered Bandhula in the king&rsquo;s ear, accusing him of aiming at the kingdom himself. The king listened to their words, and could not control his suspicions. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;if he be slain here, I shall be blamed.&rdquo; He instigated certain men to harry the frontier districts; then sending for Bandhula, he said: &ldquo;The borders are in a blaze; go with your sons and capture the brigands.&rdquo; With him he also sent other men sufficient, mighty men of war, with instructions to kill him and his two-and-thirty sons, and cut off their heads, and bring them back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">While he was yet on the way, the hired brigands got wind of the general&rsquo;s coming, and took to flight. He settled the people of that district in their homes, and quieted the province, and set out for home. Then when he was not far from the city, those warriors cut off his head and the heads of his sons.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9597"></a><span class="t34">On that day Mallikā had sent an invitation to the two chief disciples along with five hundred of the monks. Early in the forenoon a letter was brought to her, with news that her husband and sons had lost their heads. When she heard this, without a word to a soul, she tucked the letter in her dress, and waited upon the company of the monks. Her attendants had given rice to the monks, when bringing in a bowl of ghee they happened to break the bowl just in front of the elders. Then the Captain of the Dhamma said: &ldquo;Pots are made to be broken; do not trouble about it.&rdquo; The lady produced her letter from the fold of her dress, saying: &ldquo;Here I have a letter informing me that my husband and his two-and-thirty sons have been beheaded. If I do not trouble about that, am I likely to trouble when a bowl is broken?&rdquo; The Captain of the Dhamma now began, &ldquo;Unseen, unknown,&rdquo; and so forth, then rising from his seat uttered a discourse [Sallasutta, Snp 3.8], and went home.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">She summoned her two-and-thirty daughters-in-law, and to them said: &ldquo;Your husbands, though innocent, have reaped the fruit of their former deeds. Do not you grieve, nor commit a wrong worse even than the king&rsquo;s.&rdquo; This was her advice. The king&rsquo;s spies hearing this speech brought word to him that they were not angry. Then the king was distressed, and went to her dwelling, and craving pardon of Mallikā and her sons&rsquo; wives, offered a boon. She replied, &ldquo;Be it accepted.&rdquo; She set out the funeral feast, and bathed, and then went before the king. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you granted me a boon. I want nothing but this, that you permit my two-and-thirty daughters-in-law and me to go back to our own homes.&rdquo; The king consented. Each of her two-and-thirty sons&rsquo; wives she sent away to her home, and herself returned to the home of her family in the city of Kusināra. And the king gave the post of commander-in-chief to one Dīghakārāyana, sister&rsquo;s son to the general Bandhula. But he went about picking faults in the king and saying: &ldquo;He murdered my uncle.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Ever after the murder of the innocent Bandhula the king was devoured by remorse, and had no peace of mind, felt no joy in being king.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9598"></a><span class="t34">At that time the Teacher dwelt near a country town of the Sakyas, named Uḷumpa. There went the king, pitched a camp not far from the park, and with a few attendants went to the monastery to salute the Teacher. The five symbols of royalty he handed to Kārāyana, and alone entered the Perfumed Chamber. All that followed must be described as in the Dhammacetiyasutta [MN 89]. When he entered the Perfumed Chamber, Kārāyana took those symbols of royalty, and made Viḍūḍabha king; and leaving behind for the king one horse and a serving woman, he went to Sāvatthi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">After a pleasant conversation with the Teacher, the king on his return saw no army. He enquired of the woman, and learned what had been done. Then set out for the city of Rājagaha, resolved to take his nephew with him, and capture Viḍūḍabha. It was late when he came to the city, and the gates were shut; and lying down in a shed, exhausted by exposure to wind and sun, he died there.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When the night began to grow brighter, the woman began to wail, &ldquo;My lord, the king of Kosala is past help!&rdquo; The sound was heard, and news came to the king. He performed the obsequies of his uncle with great magnificence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Viḍūḍabha once firmly established on the throne remembered that grudge of his, and determined to destroy the Sakyas one and all; to which end he set out with a large army. That day at dawn the Teacher, looking forth over the world, saw destruction threatening his kin. &ldquo;I must help my kindred,&rdquo; thought he. In the forenoon he went in search of alms, then after returning from his meal lay down lion-like in his Perfumed Chamber, and in the evening-time, having past through the air to a spot near Kapilavatthu, sat beneath a tree that gave scanty shade. Hard by that place, a huge and shady banyan tree stood on the boundary of Viḍūḍabha&rsquo;s realms. Viḍūḍabha seeing the Teacher approached and saluting him, said: &ldquo;Why, sir, are you sitting under so thin a tree in all this heat? Sit beneath this shady banyan, sir.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Let be, O king! The shade of my kindred keeps me cool.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Teacher,&rdquo; thought the other, &ldquo;must have come here to protect his clansmen.&rdquo; So he saluted the Teacher, and returned again to Sāvatthi. And the Teacher rising went to Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">A second and a third time the king called to mind his grudge against the Sakyas, a second and a third time he set forth, and again saw the Teacher seated in the same place, then again returned.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">A fourth time he set out; and the Teacher, scanning the former deeds of the Sakyas, perceived that nothing could do away with the effect of their evildoing, in casting poison into the river; so he did not go there the fourth time. Then king Viḍūḍabha slew all the Sakyas, beginning with babes at the breast, and with the blood of the hearts washed the bench, and returned.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks began talking in the Dhamma Hall, saying: &ldquo;The supreme Buddha does good works towards his relatives.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.370}</span><span class="t30"> When the Teacher had asked and been told their theme, he said: &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time a Tathāgata has done good works towards his relatives,&rdquo; and so he told a story of the past time.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a monkey&rsquo;s womb. When he grew up and attained stature and stoutness, he was strong and vigorous, and lived in the Himālayas with a retinue of eighty thousand monkeys. Near the Ganges bank there was a mango tree (others say it was a banyan), with branches and forks, having a deep shade and thick leaves, like a mountaintop. Its sweet fruits, of divine fragrance and flavour, were as large as waterpots; from one branch the fruits fell on the ground, from one into the Ganges water, from two into the main trunk of the tree. The Bodhisatta, while eating the fruit with a troop of monkeys, thought: &ldquo;Someday danger will come upon us owing to the fruit of this tree falling on the water,&rdquo; and so, not to leave one fruit on the branch which grew over the water, he made them eat or throw down the flowers at their season from the time they were of the size of a chick-pea. But notwithstanding, one ripe fruit, unseen by the eighty thousand monkeys, hidden by an ant&rsquo;s nest, fell into the river, and stuck in the net above the king of Benares, who was bathing for amusement with a net above him and another below.</p>
<p class="p7">When the king had amused himself all day and was going away in the evening, the fishermen, who were drawing the net, saw the fruit and not knowing what it was, showed it to the king. The king asked, &ldquo;What is this fruit?&rdquo; &ldquo;We do not know, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who will know?&rdquo; &ldquo;The foresters, sire.&rdquo; He had the foresters called, and learning from them that it was a mango, he cut it with a knife, and first making the foresters eat of it, he ate of it himself <span class="t18">{3.371}</span> and had some of it given to his harem and his ministers. The flavour of the ripe mango remained pervading the king&rsquo;s whole body.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9599"></a>Possessed by desire of the flavour, he asked the foresters where that tree stood, and hearing that it was on a river bank in the <span class="t18">[3.226]</span> Himālayas, he had many rafts joined together and sailed upstream by the route shown by the foresters. The exact account of days is not given. In due course they came to the place, and the foresters said to the king, &ldquo;Sire, there is the tree.&rdquo; The king stopped the rafts and went on foot with a great retinue, and having a bed prepared at the foot of the tree, he lay down after eating the mango fruit and enjoying the various excellent flavours. At each side they set a guard and made a fire.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9600"></a>When the men had fallen asleep, the Bodhisatta came at midnight with his retinue. Eighty thousand monkeys moving from branch to branch ate the mangoes. The king, waking and seeing the herd of monkeys, roused his men and calling his archers said: &ldquo;Surround these monkeys that eat the mangoes so that they may not escape, and shoot them; tomorrow we will eat mangoes with monkey&rsquo;s flesh.&rdquo; The archers obeyed, saying: &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and surrounding the tree stood with arrows ready. The monkeys seeing them and fearing death, as they could not escape, came to the Bodhisatta and said: &ldquo;Sire, the archers stand round the tree, saying: &ldquo;We will shoot those vagrant monkeys,&rdquo; what are we to do?&rdquo; and so stood shivering. The Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;Do not fear, I will give you life,&rdquo; and so comforting the herd of monkeys, he ascended a branch that rose up straight, went along another branch that stretched towards the Ganges, and springing from the end of it, he passed a hundred bow-lengths and lighted on a bush on the bank.<a id="a9601"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15654"><span class="t9">{675}</span></a> Coming down, he marked the distance, saying: &ldquo;That will be the distance I have come,&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.372}</span> and cutting a bamboo shoot at the root and stripping it, he said: &ldquo;So much will be fastened to the tree, and so much will stay in the air,&rdquo; and so reckoned the two lengths, forgetting the part fastened on his own waist. Taking the shoot he fastened one end of it to the tree on the Ganges bank and the other to his own waist, and then cleared the space of a hundred bow-lengths with the speed of a cloud torn by the wind.</p>
<p class="p7">From not reckoning the part fastened to his waist, he failed to reach the tree; so seizing a branch firmly with both hands he gave signal to the troop of monkeys, &ldquo;Go quickly with good luck, treading on my back along the bamboo shoot.&rdquo; The eighty thousand monkeys escaped thus, after saluting the Bodhisatta and getting his leave. Devadatta was then a monkey and among that herd; he said: &ldquo;This is a chance for me to see the last of my enemy,&rdquo; so climbing up a branch he made a spring and fell on the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s back. The Bodhisatta&rsquo;s heart broke and great pain came on him. Devadatta having caused that maddening pain went away; and the Bodhisatta was alone.</p>
<p class="p7">The king being awake saw all that was done by the monkeys and the Bodhisatta; and he lay down thinking: &ldquo;This animal, not reckoning his own life, has seen to the safety of his troop.&rdquo; When day broke, being pleased with the Bodhisatta, he thought: &ldquo;It is not right to <span class="t18">[3.227] </span>destroy this king of the monkeys; I will bring him down by some means and take care of him,&rdquo; so turning the raft down the Ganges and building a platform there, he made the Bodhisatta come down gently, and had him clothed with a yellow robe on his back and washed in Ganges water, made him drink sugared water, and had his body cleansed and anointed with oil refined a thousand times; then he put an oiled skin on a bed and making him lie there, he set himself on a low seat, and spoke the first verse: <span class="t18">{3.373}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;You made yourself a bridge for them to pass in safety through;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What are you then to them, monkey, and what are they to you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing him, the Bodhisatta instructing the king spoke the other verses;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Victorious king, I guard the herd, I am their lord and chief,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When they were filled with fear of you and stricken sore with grief.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. I leapt a hundred times the length of bow outstretched that lies,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When I had bound a bamboo-shoot firmly around my thighs;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. I reached the tree like thunder-cloud sped by the tempest&rsquo;s blast;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I lost my strength, but reached a bough; with hands I held it fast.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. And as I hung extended there held fast by shoot and bough,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My monkeys passed across my back and are in safety now.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Therefore I fear no pain of death, bonds do not give me pain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The happiness of those was won o&rsquo;er whom I used to reign.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. A parable for you, O king, if you the truth would read;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The happiness of kingdom and of army and of steed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And city must be dear to you, if you would rule indeed.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.374}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta, thus instructing and teaching the king, died. The king, calling his ministers, gave orders that the monkey-king should have obsequies like a king, and he sent to the harem, saying: &ldquo;Come to the cemetery, as retinue for the monkey-king, with red garments, and dishevelled hair, and torches in your hands.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.375}</span> The ministers made a funeral pile with a hundred wagon loads of timber. Having prepared the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s obsequies in a royal manner, they took his skull, and came to the king. The king caused a shrine to be built at the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s burial-place, torches to be burnt there and offerings of incense and flowers to be made; he had the skull inlaid with gold, and put in front raised on a spear-point; honouring it with incense and flowers, he put it at the king&rsquo;s gate when he came to Benares, and having the whole city decked out he paid honour to it for seven days. Then taking it as a relic and raising a shrine, he honoured it with incense and garlands all his life; and established in the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s teaching he gave alms and did other good deeds, and ruling his kingdom righteously became destined for heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the king was Ānanda, the monkey&rsquo;s retinue the assembly, and the monkey-king myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

The occasion will appear in the Pānīyajātaka [Ja 459].</span><a id="a9612"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15656"><span class="t9">{676}</span></a><a id="a9613"></a><a id="a9614"></a><span class="t30"> At that time in Sāvatthi five hundred friends, who had become ascetics, dwelling in the House of the Golden Pavement, had lustful thoughts at midnight. The Teacher regards his disciples three times a night and three times a day, six times every night and day, as a jay guards her egg, or a yak-cow her tail, or a mother her beloved son, or a one-eyed man his remaining eye; so in the very instant he overcame wrong which was beginning. He was observing Jetavana on that midnight and knowing the monks&rsquo; conduct and their thoughts, he considered, &ldquo;This wrong among these monks if it grows will destroy the foundation for becoming an Arahat. I will this moment repudiate this wrong and show them how to become an Arahat,&rdquo; so leaving the perfumed chamber he called Ānanda, </span><a id="a9615"></a><span class="t18">{3.376}</span><a id="a9616"></a><a id="a9617"></a><span class="t30"> and bidding him collect all the monks dwelling in the place, he got them together and sat down on the seat prepared for Buddha. He said: &ldquo;Monks, it is not right to live in the power of defiled thoughts; a wrong if it grows brings great ruin like an enemy; a monk ought to rebuke even a little wrong; wise men of old seeing even a very slight cause, rebuked a defiled thought that had begun and so became Paccekabuddhas,&rdquo; and so he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a potter&rsquo;s family in a suburb of Benares; when he grew up he became a householder, had a son and daughter, and supported his wife and children by his potter&rsquo;s handicraft. At that time in the Kaliṅga kingdom, in the city of Dantapura, the king named Karaṇḍu, going to his garden with a great retinue, saw at the garden-gate a mango tree laden with sweet fruit; he stretched out his hand from his seat on the elephant and seized a bunch of mangoes; then entering the garden he sat on the royal seat and ate a mango, giving some to those worthy of favours. From the time when the king took one, ministers, brahmins, and householders, thinking that others should also do so, took down and ate mangoes from that tree. Coming again and again they climbed the tree, and beating it with clubs and breaking the branches down and off, they ate the fruit, not leaving even the unripe.</p>
<p class="p7">The king amused himself in the garden for the day, and at evening as he came by on the royal elephant he dismounted on seeing the tree, and going to its root he looked up and thought: &ldquo;In the morning this tree stood beautiful with its burden of fruit and those who gazed upon it could not be satisfied; now it stands not beautiful with its fruit broken down and off.&rdquo; Again looking from another place <span class="t18">[3.229] </span>he saw another mango tree barren, and thought: &ldquo;This mango tree stands beautiful in its barrenness like a bare mountain of jewels; the other from its fruitfulness <span class="t18">{3.377}</span><a id="a9618"></a> fell into misfortune; the householder&rsquo;s life is like a fruitful tree, the ascetic life like a barren tree; the wealthy have fear, the poor have no fear; I too would be like the barren tree.&rdquo; So taking the fruit tree as his subject, he stood at the root; and considering the three signs<a id="a9619"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15658"><span class="t9">{677}</span></a> and perfecting spiritual insight, he became a Paccekabuddha, and reflecting, &ldquo;The envelope of the womb is now fallen from me, rebirth in the three existences is ended, the filth of transmigration is cleansed, the ocean of tears dried up, the wall of bones broken down, there is no more rebirth for me,&rdquo; he stood as if adorned with every ornament.</p>
<p class="p7">Then his ministers said: &ldquo;You stand too long, O great king.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not a king, I am a Paccekabuddha.&rdquo; &ldquo;Paccekabuddhas are not like you, O king.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then what are they like?&rdquo; &ldquo;Their hair and beards are shaved, they are dressed in yellow robes, they are not attached to family or tribe, they are like clouds torn by wind or the moon&rsquo;s orb freed from Rāhu, and they dwell in the Himālayas in the Nandamūla cave; such, O king, are the Paccekabuddhas.&rdquo; At that moment the king threw up his hand and touched his head, and instantly the marks of a householder disappeared, and the marks of a monastic came into view,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Three robes, bowl, razor, needles, strainer, belt,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A pious monk those eight marks should own,</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9620"></a>the requisites, as they are called, of a monastic became attached to his body. Standing in the air he preached to the multitude, and then went through the sky to the mountain cave Nandamūla in the Upper Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">In the kingdom of Kandahar in the city Taxila, the king named Naggaji on a terrace, in the middle of a royal couch, saw a woman who had put a jewelled bracelet on each hand and was grinding perfume as she sat near; he thought: &ldquo;These jewelled bracelets do not rub or jingle when separate,&rdquo; and so sat watching. Then she, putting the bracelet from the right hand <span class="t18">{3.378}</span> on the left hand and collecting perfume with the right, began to grind it. The bracelet on the left hand rubbing against the other made a noise. The king observed that these two bracelets made a sound when rubbing against each other, and he thought: &ldquo;That bracelet when separate touched nothing, it now touches the second and makes a noise; just so living beings when separate do not touch or make a noise, when they become two or three they rub against each other and make a din; now I rule the inhabitants in the two kingdoms of Kashmir and Kandahar, and I too ought to dwell like the single bracelet ruling myself and not ruling another,&rdquo; so making the rubbing of the bracelets his topic, seated as he <span class="t18">[3.230] </span><a id="a9621"></a><a id="a9622"></a>was, he realised the three characteristics, attained spiritual insight, and became a Paccekabuddha. Standing in the air he preached to the multitude, and then went through the sky to the mountain cave Nandamūla in the Upper Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">In the kingdom of Videha, in the city of Mithila, the king, named Nimi, after breakfast, surrounded by his ministers, stood looking down at the street through an open window of the palace. A hawk, having taken some meat from the meat-market, was flying up into the air. Some vultures or other birds, surrounding the hawk on each side, went on pecking it with their beaks, striking it with their wings and beating it with their feet, for the sake of the meat. Not enduring to be killed, the hawk dropped the flesh, another bird took it; the rest leaving the hawk fell on the other; when he relinquished it, a third took it; and they pecked him also in the same way. The king seeing those birds thought: &ldquo;Whoever took the flesh, sorrow befell him; whoever relinquished it, happiness befell him; whoever takes the five pleasures of sense, sorrow befalls him, happiness the other man; these are common to many; now I have sixteen thousand women; I ought to live in happiness leaving the five pleasures of sense, as the hawk relinquishing the morsel of flesh.&rdquo; Considering this wisely, <span class="t18">{3.379}</span><a id="a9623"></a> standing as he was, he realised the three characteristics, attained spiritual insight, and became a wise Paccekabuddha. Standing in the air he preached to the multitude, and then went through the sky to the mountain cave Nandamūla in the Upper Himālayas.</p>
<p class="p7">In the kingdom of Uttarapañcāla, in the city of Kampilla, the king, named Dummukha, after breakfast, with all his ornaments and surrounded by his ministers, stood looking down on the palace-yard from an open window. At the instant they opened the door of a cow-pen; the bulls coming from the pen set upon one cow in lust; and one great bull with sharp horns seeing another bull coming, possessed by the jealousy of lust, struck him in the thigh with his sharp horns. By the force of the blow his entrails came out, and so he died. The king seeing this thought: &ldquo;Living beings from the state of beasts upwards become sorrowful from the power of lust; this bull through lust has reached death; other beings also are disturbed by lust; I ought to abandon the sensual desires that disturb those beings,&rdquo; and so standing as he was he realised the three characteristics, attained spiritual insight and became a wise Paccekabuddha. Standing in the air he preached to the multitude, and then went through the sky to the mountain cave Nandamūla in the Upper Himālayas</p>
<p class="p7">Then one day those four Paccekabuddhas, considering that it was time for their rounds, left the Nandamūla cave, having cleansed their teeth by chewing betel in the Lake Anotatta, and having attended to their needs in Manosilā, they took the bowl and robe, and by Supernormal Powers flying in the air, and treading on clouds of the five colours, they alighted not far from a suburb of Benares. In a convenient spot they put on the robes, took the bowl, and entering the suburb they went the rounds for alms till they came to the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s house-door. The Bodhisatta seeing them was delighted and making them enter his house he made them sit on a seat prepared, he respectfully <span class="t18">[3.231] </span>gave them water and served them with excellent food, hard and soft. Then sitting on one side he saluted the eldest of them, saying: &ldquo;Sir, your ascetic life appears very beautiful; your senses are very calm, your complexion is very clear; what topic of thought <span class="t18">{3.380}</span> made you take to the ascetic life and ordination?&rdquo; and as he asked the eldest of them, so also he came up to the others and he asked them also. Then those four saying: &ldquo;I was so and so, king of such and such a city, in such and such a kingdom,&rdquo; and so on, in that way each told the causes of his retiring from the world and spoke one verse each in order;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;A mango in a forest did I see</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Full-grown, and dark, fruitful exceedingly;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And for its fruit those men did the tree break,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas this inclined my heart the bowl to take.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;A bracelet, polished by a hand renowned,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A woman wore on each wrist without sound;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">One touched the other and a noise did wake;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas this inclined my heart the bowl to take.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Birds in a flock a bird unfriended tore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who all alone a lump of carrion bore;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The bird was smitten for the carrion&rsquo;s sake</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas this inclined my heart the bowl to take.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;A bull in pride among his fellows paced;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">High rose his back, with strength and beauty graced;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From lust he died; a horn his wound did make;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas this inclined my heart the bowl to take.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {3.381}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta, hearing each verse, said: &ldquo;Good, sir; your topic is suitable,&rdquo; and so commended each Paccekabuddha; and having listened to the discourse delivered by those four, he became disinclined to a householder&rsquo;s life. When the Paccekabuddhas went away, after breakfast seated at his ease, he called his wife and said: &ldquo;Wife, those four Paccekabuddhas left kingdoms to be monks and now live without wrong, without hindrance, in the bliss of the ascetic life; while I make a livelihood by earnings; what have I to do with a householder&rsquo;s life? Do you take the children and stay in the house,&rdquo; and he spoke two verses;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Kaliṅga&rsquo;s king Karaṇḍu, Gandhāra&rsquo;s Naggaji,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pañcāla&rsquo;s ruler Dummukha, Videha&rsquo;s great Nimi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Have left their thrones and live the monastic life sinlessly.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Here their godlike forms they show</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Each one like a blazing fire;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bhaggavi, I too will go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Leaving all that men desire.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.382}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing his words she said: &ldquo;Husband, ever since I heard the discourse of the Paccekabuddhas I too have no happiness in the house,&rdquo; and she spoke a verse: <span class="t18">[3.232]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis the appointed time, I know;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Better teachers may not be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bhaggava, I too will go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like a bird from hand set free.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta hearing her words was silent. She was deceiving the Bodhisatta, as she was anxious to take the ascetic life before him; so she said: &ldquo;Husband, I am going to the water-tank, do you look after the children,&rdquo; and taking a pot as if she had been going there, she went away and coming to the ascetics outside the town she was ordained by them.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta finding that she did not return attended to the children himself. Afterwards when they grew up a little and could understand for themselves, in order to teach them, <span class="t18">{3.383}</span> when cooking rice he would cook one day a little hard and raw, one day a little underdone, one day well-cooked, one day sodden, one day without salt, another with too much. The children said: &ldquo;Father, the rice today is not-boiled, today it is sodden, today well cooked; today it is without salt, today it has too much salt.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;Yes, dears,&rdquo; and thought: &ldquo;These children now know what is raw and what is cooked, what has salt and what has none; they will be able to live in their own way; I ought to become ordained.&rdquo; Then showing them to their kinsfolk he was ordained to the ascetic life, and dwelt outside the city. Then one day the female ascetic begging in Benares saw him and saluted him, saying: &ldquo;Sir, I believe you killed the children.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t kill children; when they could understand for themselves I became ordained; you were careless of them and pleased yourself by being ordained,&rdquo; and so he spoke the last verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Having seen they could distinguish salt from saltless, boiled from raw,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I became a monk; leave me, we can each follow the law.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So exhorting the female ascetic he took leave of her. She taking the exhortation saluted the Bodhisatta and went to a place that pleased her. After that day they never saw each other. The Bodhisatta reaching supernatural knowledge became destined to the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, After the Truths five hundred monks became Arahats. &ldquo;At that time the daughter was Uppalavaṇṇā, the son was Rāhula, the female ascetic Rāhula&rsquo;s mother, and the ascetic was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

Now the way in which this elephant was adorned and the royal lineage of Udena will be set forth in the Mātaṅgajātaka [Ja 497].</span><a id="a9633"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15660"><span class="t9">{678}</span></a><span class="t30"> One day this elephant going out of the city in the morning saw the Buddha surrounded by a multitude of saints, in the incomparable majesty of a Buddha, entering the city for alms, and falling at the Tathāgata&rsquo;s feet, with lamentation she prayed to him, saying: &ldquo;Lord who knowest all, saviour of the whole world, when I was young and able to do work, Udena, the rightful king, loved me, saying, &lsquo;My life and kingdom and queen are all due to her,&rsquo; and gave me great honour, adorning me with all ornaments; he had my stall smeared with perfumed earth, and coloured hangings put round it, and a lamp lit with perfumed oil, and a dish of incense set there, he had a golden pot set on my dunghill, and made me stand on a coloured carpet, and gave me royal food of many choice flavours; but now when I am old and cannot do work, he has cut off all that honour; unprotected and destitute I live by eating ketaka fruit in the forest; I have no other refuge; make Udena think on my merits and restore me again my old honour, O Lord.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher said: &ldquo;Go you, I will speak to the king and get your old honour restored,&rdquo; and he went to the door of the king&rsquo;s dwelling. The king made Buddha enter, and gave great entertainment in the palace to the assembly of monks following Buddha. When the meal was over, the Teacher gave thanks to the king and asked, &ldquo;O king, where is Bhaddavatikā?&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord, I know not.&rdquo; &ldquo;O king, after giving honour to servants, it is not right to take it away in their old age, it is right to be grateful and thankful; Bhaddavatikā is now old, she is worn with age and unprotected, and she lives by eating ketaka fruit in the wood; it is not meet for you to leave her unprotected in her old age,&rdquo; so telling Bhaddavatikā&rsquo;s merits and saying: &ldquo;Restore all her former honours,&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.385}</span><span class="t30"> he departed. The king did so. It was spread over the whole city that the former honour was restored because the Buddha had spoken of her merits.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This became known in the assembly of the monks, and the monks discussed it in their meeting. The Teacher, coming and hearing that this was their subject, said: &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time that the Buddha has by telling her merits got her former honours restored,&rdquo; and he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9634"></a><a id="a9635"></a>In the past there was a king named Daḷhadhamma reigning in Benares. At that time the Bodhisatta was born in a minister&rsquo;s family, and when he grew up he served the king. He received much honour from the king, and stood in the place of the most valued minister. The king had a certain female elephant,<a id="a9636"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15662"><span class="t9">{679}</span></a> endowed with might and very strong. She went a hundred leagues in one day, she did the duties of messenger <span class="t18">[3.234] </span>for the king, and in battle she fought and crushed the enemy. The king said: &ldquo;She is very serviceable to me,&rdquo; gave her all ornaments and caused all honour to be given her such as Udena gave to Bhaddavatikā.</p>
<p class="p7">Then when she was weak from age the king took away all her honour. From that time she was unprotected and lived by eating grass and leaves in the forest. Then one day when the vessels in the king&rsquo;s court were not sufficient, the king sent for a potter, and said: &ldquo;The vessels are not sufficient.&rdquo; &ldquo;O king, I have no oxen to yoke in carts to bring cow-dung (for baking clay).&rdquo; The king hearing this tale said: &ldquo;Where is our female elephant?&rdquo; &ldquo;O king, she is wandering at her own will.&rdquo; The king gave her to the potter, saying: &ldquo;Henceforth do you yoke her and bring cow-dung.&rdquo; The potter said: &ldquo;Good, O king,&rdquo; and did so.</p>
<p class="p7">Then one day she, coming out of the city, saw the Bodhisatta coming in, and falling at his feet, she said, lamenting, &ldquo;Lord, the king in my youth considered me very serviceable and gave me great honour; <span class="t18">{3.386}</span> now that I am old, he has cut it all away and takes no thought of me; I am unprotected and live by eating grass and leaves in the forest; in this misery he has now given me to a potter to yoke in a cart; except you I have no refuge; you know my services to the king; restore me now the honour I have lost,&rdquo; and she spoke three verses;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;I carried for the king of old; was he not satisfied?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With weapons at my breast I faced the fight with mighty stride.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. My feats in battle done of old does not the king forget,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And such good services I did for couriers as were set?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Helpless and kinless now am I; surely my death is near,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To serve a potter when I&rsquo;m come as his dung-carrier.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.387}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta, hearing her tale, comforted her, saying: &ldquo;Grieve not, I will tell the king and restore your honour,&rdquo; so entering the city, he went to the king after his morning meal and took up the talk, saying: &ldquo;Great king, did not a female elephant, named so and so, enter battle at such and such places with weapons bound on her breast, and on such a day with a writing on her neck did she not go a hundred leagues on a message? You gave her great honour; where is she now?&rdquo; &ldquo;I gave her to a potter for carrying dung.&rdquo; Then the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;Is it right, great king, for you to give her to a potter to be yoked in a cart?&rdquo; And for admonition he spoke four verses;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;By selfish hopes men regulate the honours that they pay;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As you the elephant, they throw the outworn slave away.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. Good deeds and services received whenever men forget,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ruin pursues the business still on which their hearts are set.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Good deeds and services received if men do not forget,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Success attends the business still on which their hearts are set. </span><span class="t18">[3.235]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. To all the multitude around this blessed truth I tell;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be grateful all, and for reward you long in heaven shall dwell.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.388}</span></p>
<p class="p6">With this beginning the Bodhisatta gave instruction to all gathered there. Hearing this the king gave the old elephant her former honour, and established in the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s instruction gave alms and did works of merit and became destined for heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the female elephant was Bhaddavatikā, the king Ānanda, the minister was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a9641"></a><span class="t15">In the present one old monk has a novice to help him. But when the novice dies he is inconsolable. The Buddha tells a story of an ascetic who adopted an elephant, and the advice he received from Sakka when it died.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (the King of the Devas) Sakka,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the old monk = the ascetic (tāpasa),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Deep in the wood.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this while dwelling at Jetavana, about a certain old monk. The story was that this monk ordained a novice, who waited on him but soon died of a fatal disease. The old man went about weeping and wailing for his death.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Seeing him, the monks began to talk in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Sirs, this old monk goes about weeping and wailing for the novice&rsquo;s death; he must surely have neglected the meditation on death.&rdquo; The Teacher came, and hearing the subject of their talk, he said: &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time this man is weeping for the other&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; and so he told the old tale.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was Sakka. A certain wealthy brahmin, living in Benares, left the world, and became an ascetic in the Himālayas, <span class="t18">{3.389}</span> living by picking up roots and fruits in the forest. One day, searching for wild fruits, he saw an elephant-calf, and took it to his hermitage; he made as if it were his own son, calling it Somadatta, and tended it with food of grass and leaves. The elephant grew up to be great; but one day he took much food and fell sick of a surfeit. The ascetic took him inside the hermitage, and went to get wild fruits; but before he came back the young elephant died. Coming back with his fruits, the ascetic thought: &ldquo;On other days my child comes to meet me, but not today; what is the matter with him?&rdquo; So he lamented and spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Deep in the wood he&rsquo;d meet me; but today</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No elephant I see; where does he stray?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.236]</span></p>
<p class="p6">With this lament, he saw the elephant lying at the end of the covered walk and taking him round the neck he spoke the second verse in lamentation;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis he that lies in death cut down as a tender shoot is shred;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Low on the ground he lies; alas, my elephant is dead.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">At the instant, Sakka, surveying the world, thought: &ldquo;This ascetic left wife and child for the dispensation, now he is lamenting the young elephant whom he called his son, I will rouse him and make him think,&rdquo; and so coming to the hermitage he stood in the air and spoke the third verse: <span class="t18">{3.390}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;To sorrow for the dead does ill become</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The lone ascetic, freed from ties of home.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, the ascetic spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Should man with beast consort, O Sakka, grief</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For a lost playmate finds in tears relief.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka uttered two verses, admonishing him:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Such as to weep are fain may still lament the dead,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Weep not, O sage, &rsquo;tis vain to weep, the wise have said.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. If by our tears we might prevail against the grave,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus would we all unite our dearest ones to save.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing Sakka&rsquo;s words, the ascetic took thought and comfort, dried his tears, and uttered the remaining verses in praise of Sakka:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;As ghee-fed flame that blazes out amain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is quenched with water, so he quenched my pain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. With sorrow&rsquo;s shaft my heart was wounded sore;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He healed my wound and did my life restore. </span><span class="t18">{3.391}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. The barb extracted, full of joy and peace,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At Sakka&rsquo;s words I from my sorrow cease.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9642"></a>These verses were given above.<a id="a9643"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15664"><span class="t9">{680}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">After admonishing the ascetic, Sakka went to his own place.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, after the lesson, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the young elephant was the novice, the ascetic the old monk, Sakka was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks are discussing the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s Great Renunciation. The Buddha tells a story of a family priest who was asked to rule a country. He did so until shown a grey hair by his queen, upon which he renounced the kingdom and became an ascetic.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a9649"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = king Susīma (Susīmarājā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Rāhulamātā = his queen (aggamahesī),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Ānanda = his friend, the king (of Benares) (sahāyarājā).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9650"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Renunciation, Asceticism.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Heretofore the hairs.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.237] </span><a id="a9651"></a><span class="t30">The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, about the Great Renunciation. The monks were sitting in the Dhamma Hall, praising the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; renunciation. The Teacher, finding that this was their topic, said: &ldquo;Monks, it is not strange that I should now make the Great Renunciation and retirement from the world, I who have for many hundred thousand ages exercised perfection; of old also I gave up the reign over the kingdom of Kāsi, three hundred leagues in extent, and made the renunciation,&rdquo; and so he told the old tale.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was conceived in the womb of his family priest&rsquo;s chief wife. On the day of his birth, the king also had a son born. On the naming day they called the Great Being Susīmakumāra, and the king&rsquo;s son Brahmadattakumāra. The king, seeing the two were born on the same day, had the Bodhisatta given to the nurse and brought up together with his own son. They both grew up fair, like sons of gods; <span class="t18">{3.392}</span> they both learned all sciences at Taxila and came home again.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9652"></a>The prince became viceroy, eating, drinking, and living along with the Bodhisatta; at his father&rsquo;s death he became king, giving great honour to the Bodhisatta and making him his priest; one day he adorned the city, and decked like Sakka, king of gods, he went round the city in procession, seated on the shoulder of a royal elephant in his pride, equal to Erāvaṇa,<a id="a9653"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15666"><span class="t9">{681}</span></a> with the Bodhisatta behind on the elephant&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p class="p7">The queen-mother, looking out from the royal window to see her son, saw the priest behind him as he came back from the procession; she fell in love with him and entering her chamber thought: &ldquo;If I cannot win him, I shall die here,&rdquo; so she left her food and lay there. The king, not seeing her, asked after her; when he heard she was ill, he went to her, and asked with respect what ailed her. She would not tell for shame. He sat on the royal throne, and sent his own chief queen to find what ailed his mother. She went and asked, stroking the queen-mother&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p class="p7">Women do not hide secrets from women; and the secret was told. The queen went and told the king. He said: &ldquo;Well, go and comfort her; I will make the priest king, and make her his chief queen.&rdquo; She went and comforted her. The king sent for the priest and told him the matter, &ldquo;Friend, save my mother&rsquo;s life; you shall be <span class="t18">[3.238] </span>king, she your chief queen, I viceroy.&rdquo; The priest said: &ldquo;It cannot be,&rdquo; but being asked again he consented; and the king made the priest king, the queen-mother chief queen, and himself viceroy. They lived all in harmony together, but the Bodhisatta pined amid a householder&rsquo;s life; he left desires and inclined to an ascetic life; careless of the pleasures of sense he stood and sat and lay alone, like a man bound in jail or a chicken in a cage. <span class="t18">{3.393}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The chief queen thought: &ldquo;The king avoids me, he stands and sits and lies alone; he is young and fresh, I am old and have grey hairs; what if I were to tell him a story that he has one grey hair, make him believe it and seek my company? &ldquo;One day, as if cleaning the king&rsquo;s head, she said: &ldquo;Your majesty is getting old, there is a grey hair on your head.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pull it out and put it in my hand.&rdquo; She pulled a hair out, but threw it away and put into his hand one of her own grey hairs. When he saw it, fear of death made the sweat start from his forehead, though it was like a plate of gold. He admonished himself, saying: &ldquo;Susīma, you have become old in your youth; all this time sunk in the mud of desire, like a village pig wallowing in filth and mire, you cannot leave it; quit desires, and become an ascetic in the Himālayas; it is high time for the ascetic life,&rdquo; and with this thought, he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Heretofore the hairs were dark</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Clustering about my brow;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">White today; Susīma, mark!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Time for dispensation now!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So the Bodhisatta praised the ascetic life; but the queen saw she had caused him to leave her instead of loving her, and in fear, wishing to keep him from the ascetic life by praising his body, she uttered two verses; <span class="t18">{3.394}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Mine, not thine, the silvered hair;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mine the head from which it came;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For your good the lie I dare;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">One such fault forbear to blame!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. You are young, and fair to see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like a tender plant in spring!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Keep your kingdom, smile on me!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seek not now what age will bring!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;Lady, you tell of what must come; as age ripens, these dark hairs must turn and become pale like betel; I see the change and breaking up of body that comes in years, in the ripening of age, to royal maids and all the rest, though they are tender as a wreath of blue lotus-flowers, fair as gold, and drunken with the pride of their glorious youth; such, lady, is the dreary end of living beings,&rdquo; and, moreover, showing the truth with the charm of a Buddha, he uttered two verses; <span class="t18">[3.239] {3.395}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;I have marked the youthful maid,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Swaying like the tender stalk,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In her pride of form arrayed;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Men are witched where&rsquo;er she walk.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &rsquo;Tis the same one I have scanned</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(Eighty, ninety, years have passed),</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Quivering, palsied, staff in hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bent like rafter tree at last.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">In this verse the Great Being showed the misery of beauty, and now declared his discontent with the householder&rsquo;s life; <span class="t18">{3.396}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Such the thoughts I ponder o&rsquo;er;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lonely nights the thoughts allow;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Layman&rsquo;s life I love no more;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Time for dispensation now!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Delight in layman&rsquo;s life is a weak stay;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The wise man cuts it off and goes his way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Renouncing joys of sense and all their sway.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus declaring both the delight and misery of desires, he showed the truth with all a Buddha&rsquo;s charm, he sent for his friend and made him take the kingdom again; he left his majesty and power amid the loud lamentations of kinsmen and friends; he became an ascetic sage in the Himālayas, and entering on Absorption, became destined for the Brahmā Realm. <span class="t18">{3.397}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths, and giving the drink of ambrosia to many, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the chief queen was the mother of Rāhula, the king was Ānanda, and king Susīma was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
