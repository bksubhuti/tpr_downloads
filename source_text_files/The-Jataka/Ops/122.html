<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14089"></a><span class="t12">356. Then Bhāradvāja</span><a id="a14090"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17857"><span class="t19">{1729}</span></a><span class="t12"> went along until he came anigh</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unto the ascetic&rsquo;s place, to whom he spake thus courteously:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14091"></a><span class="t12">357. &lsquo;O holy man, I trust that you are prosperous and well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With grain to glean and roots and fruit abundant where you dwell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">358. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or from wild beasts of prey have you immunity enjoyed?&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The ascetic said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">359. &ldquo;I thank you, brahmin &ndash; yes, I am both prosperous and well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With grain to eat and roots and fruit abundant where I dwell. </span><span class="t18">[6.277]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">360. From flies and gnats and creeping things I suffer not annoy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And from wild beasts of prey I here immunity enjoy.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">361. In all the innumerable years I&rsquo;ve lived upon this ground,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No harmful sickness that I know has ever here been found.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">362. Welcome, O brahmin! Bless the chance directed you this way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come enter with a blessing, come, and wash your feet I pray.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">363. The tindook and the piyal leaves, and kāsumārī sweet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And fruits like honey, brahmin, take the best I have, and eat,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">364. And this cool water from a cave high hidden on a hill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O noble brahmin, take of it, drink if it be your will.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Jūjaka said:<span class="t18"> {6.533}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">365. &ldquo;Accepted is your offering, and your oblation, sir.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I seek the son of Sañjaya, once banished far away</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By Sivi&rsquo;s people: if you know where he abides, please say.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The ascetic said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">366. &ldquo;You seek the king of Sivi, sir, not with a good intent:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I think your honour&rsquo;s real desire upon his wife is bent:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">367. Kaṇhājinā for handmaiden, Jāli for serving-man,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or you would fetch the mother with her children, if you can,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The prince has no enjoyments here, no wealth or food, my man.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, Jūjaka said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">368. &ldquo;I wish no ill to any man, no boon I come to pray:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But sweet it is to see the good, pleasant with them to stay.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">369. I never saw this monarch, whom his people sent away:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I came to see him: if you know where he abides, please say.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The other believed him. &ldquo;Good, I will tell you; only stay with me here today.&rdquo; So he entertained him with wild fruits and roots; and next day, stretching out his hand, he showed him the road.<a id="a14092"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17859"><span class="t9">{1730}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14093"></a><span class="t12">370. &ldquo;Sir brahmin, yonder rocky mount is Gandhamādan hill</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where lives the king Vessantara with wife and children still.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">371. With brahmin&rsquo;s dress, with hook and spoon, the ascetic&rsquo;s matted hair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Skinclad he lies upon the ground and tends the fire with care.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">372. See yonder, trees with many fruits, green on the mountain side,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">While the dark mountain-peaks uplift till in the clouds they hide.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There shrubs, and creepers, horsear, sāl, and many another tree</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sway in the wind like drunken men for anyone to see.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">373. High up above the rows of trees the birds in concert sing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Najjuha, cuckoo, flocks of them, from tree to tree flitting.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">374. Thronging among the leafy twigs they bid the stranger come,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Welcome the guest, delighting all who make the woods their home,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where with his children now abides Vessantara the king.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">375. With brahmin&rsquo;s dress, with hook and spoon, the ascetic&rsquo;s matted hair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14094"></a><span class="t12">Skinclad he lies upon the ground, and tends the fire with care. </span><span class="t18">{6.534}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">376. The foliage of the pepper tree in that fair spot is seen,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No dust is ever blown aloft, the grass is ever green.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">377. The grasses like a peacock&rsquo;s neck, soft-cotton to the touch,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Grow never more than inches four, but always just so much.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kapittha, Mango, Jambu plum, and ripe figs dangling low,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All trees whose fruit is good to eat in that fine forest grow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">378. There sweet and clean and fragrant streams as blue as beryl flow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Through which disporting up and down the shoals of fishes go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">379. A lake lies in a lovely spot, with lilies blue and white,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hard by, like that which in heaven is the Garden of Delight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">380. Three kinds of lilies in that lake present them to the sight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With varied colours: some are blue, some blood-red, others white.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus he praised the foursquare lake of lilies, and went on to praise lake Mucalinda:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">381. &ldquo;As soft as linen are the flowers, those lilies blue and white,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And other herbs grow there: the lake is Mucalinda hight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">382. And there in number infinite the full-blown flowers you see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In summer and in winter both as high as to the knee.</span><span class="t18"> [6.278]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">383. Always the many-coloured flowers blow fragrant on the breeze,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And you may hear drawn by the scent the buzzing of the bees. </span><span class="t18">{6.535}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">384. All round about the water&rsquo;s edge are standing in a row</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The ebony, the trumpet-flower, and tall kadamba trees.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14095"></a><a id="a14096"></a><span class="t12">385-390. Six-Petals and many another tree</span><a id="a14097"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17861"><span class="t19">{1731}</span></a><span class="t12"> with flowers all blow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And leafy bowers all standing round about the lake one sees.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There trees of every shape and size, there flowers of every hue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All shrubs and bushes, high and low are spread before the view:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">391. The breezes sweetly waft the scent from flowers white, blue, and red,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That grow about the hermitage wherein the fire is fed.</span><span class="t18"> {6.536}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">392. Close round about the water&rsquo;s edge grow many plants and trees,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which tremble as they echo to the murmurs of the bees.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">393-397. The scent of all the lovely blooms that grow about that shore</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Will last you if you keep them for a week, or two, or more.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">398. Three kinds of gourds, all distinct, grow in this lake, and some</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Have fruit as big as waterpots, others big as a drum.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">399-401. Mustard, green garlic, lilies blue to pick, and flowers full-blown,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Jasmine, sweet sandal, creepers huge about the trees are grown.</span><span class="t18"> {6.537}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">402. Sweet jasmine, cotton, indigo, and plants of many a name,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cress, trumpet-flower, grow all around like tongues of golden flame.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">403-404. Yea, every kind of flower that grows in water or on land,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In and about this lovely lake lo and behold they stand.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">405-406. There crocodiles and water-beasts abide of every sort,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Red deer and other animals for water do resort.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">407-408. Turmeric, camphor, panick-seed, the liquorice-plant, and all</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Most fragrant seeds and grasses grow with stalks exceeding tall.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">409-410. There lions, tigers, elephants are seeking for a mate,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Deer red and dappled, jackals, dogs, and fawns so swift of gait,</span><span class="t18"> {6.538}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">411. Yaks, antelopes, and flying fox, and monkeys great and small,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bears, bulls, and other mighty beasts come flocking one and all:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">412-413. Rhinoceros, mongoose, squirrel, boar, dog, jackal, buffalo,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Loris, hare, speckled panther, wolf and lizard, there they go:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">414-416. Spiders and snakes and hairy things, and every kind of bird,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which as they chirp and twitter round all make their voices heard:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">417. Hawk, woodcock, heron, piper, owl, the cuckoo with his flute,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Partridge, geese, ospreys, pheasants, cranes, and redbacks, follow suit.</span><span class="t18"> {6.539}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">418. There sweetly singing to their mates the gorgeous-coloured things,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">White-tufted, blue-necked, peacock-hued flutter their pretty wings.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">419-427. Why should I try their thousand names in detail to rehearse?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Imagine every kind of bird, and add them to my verse.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">428. There a melodious company their thousand songs they make</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And fill the air with pleasant noise round Mucalinda lake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">429. The wood is full of elephants, of antelopes and deer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where hanging down from all the trees great creepers do appear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">430. There mustard grows, and sugar-cane, and many kinds of rice,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And beans and other plants and herbs, all comers to suffice.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">431. Yonder the footpath leads you straight unto his settling-ground</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where never hunger, never thirst, and no distaste is found,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where with his children now abides Vessantara the king:</span><span class="t18"> [6.279]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">432. With brahmin&rsquo;s dress, with hook and spoon, the ascetic&rsquo;s matted hair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Skinclad he lies upon the ground, and tends the fire with care. </span><span class="t18">{6.540}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">433. When this he heard, the brahmin walked around him towards the right,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And went to seek Vessantara, his heart in high delight.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx36488"></a>The Children</h4>
<p class="p7">Jūjaka went on by the road pointed out to him by Accata the Ascetic, and arrived at the foursquare lake. &ldquo;It is now late evening,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;Maddī will by now have returned from the forest, and women are always in the way. Tomorrow, when she has gone into the forest, I will go to Vessantara, and ask him for the children, and before she comes back I will be away.&rdquo; So he climbed a flat-topped hill not far off, and lay down in a pleasant spot.</p>
<p class="p7">Now at dawn of the next morning, Maddī had a dream, and her dream was after this fashion: A black man clothed in two yellow robes, with red flowers in his two ears, came and entered the hut of leaves, clutched Maddī by the hair of her head and dragged her out, threw her down on the ground backwards, and amidst her shrieks tore out her two eyes, cut off two arms, cut open her breast, and tearing out the heart dripping with blood carried it away. She awoke in affright, thinking: &ldquo;I have seen an evil dream; I have no one here but Vessantara to interpret my dream, so I will ask him about it.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{6.541}</span> Then going to the hut of the Great Being, she knocked at the door. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; &ldquo;I, my lord, Maddī.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lady, why have you come here unseasonably, and broken our compact?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, it is not from desire that I come; but I have had an evil dream.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell it to me then, Maddī.&rdquo; She told it as it had appeared; the Great Being understood what the dream meant. &ldquo;The perfection of my giving,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;is to be fulfilled; this day comes a suitor to ask for my children. I will console Maddī and let her go.&rdquo; So he said: &ldquo;Your mind must have been disturbed by uneasy sleep or by indigestion; fear nothing.&rdquo; With this deceit he consoled her, and let her go. And when the night grew light, she did all that had to be done, embraced and kissed the children, and said: &ldquo;Last night I had a bad dream; be careful, my dears!&rdquo; Then she gave them in charge of the Great Being, begging him to take care of them, took her basket and tools, wiped her tears, and away to the woods for fruits and roots.</p>
<p class="p7">But Jūjaka, thinking that she would now be gone, came down from the hill and went up the footpath towards the hermitage. And the Great Being came out of his hut, and seated himself upon a slab of stone like a golden image. &ldquo;Now the suitor will come!&rdquo; he thought, like a drunkard, thirsting for a draught, and sat watching the road by which he would come, his children playing about his feet. And as he looked down the road, he saw the brahmin coming; taking up as it were the burden of his giving, for seven months laid down, he cried in joy, &ldquo;Brahmin, pray draw near!&rdquo; and to the boy Jāli he addressed this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">434. &ldquo;Jāli, arise and stand: behold a brahmin in my sight!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis the old time come back again, and fills me with delight!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[6.280]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, the boy says:<span class="t18"> {6.542}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">435. &ldquo;Yes, yes, my father, I behold the brahmin whom you see;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He comes as though a boon to ask; our guest he needs must be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And with these words, to show him honour, the boy rose up from his seat, and went to meet the brahmin, offering to relieve him of his baggage. The brahmin looked at him, and thought: &ldquo;This must be Jāli, the son of Vessantara; from the very first I will speak harshly to him.&rdquo; So he snapped his fingers at him, crying, &ldquo;Go away, go away!&rdquo; The boy thought: &ldquo;A harsh man this, to be sure!&rdquo; and looking at his body, he perceived in him the eighteen blemishes of a man. But the brahmin came up to the Bodhisatta, and politely greeting him, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">436. &ldquo;O holy man, we trust that you are prosperous and well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With grain to glean and roots and fruit abundant where you dwell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">437. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or from wild beasts of prey have you immunity enjoyed?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta answered politely</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">438. &ldquo;I thank you, brahmin, and reply: we prosper and are well</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With grain to glean and roots and fruit abundant where we dwell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">439. From flies and gnats and creeping things we suffer no annoy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14098"></a><span class="t12">And from wild beasts of prey we here immunity enjoy.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">440. Seven months we have lived happy in this forest, and have not</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Once seen a brahmin, as we now see you, godlike, I wot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With wood apple-staff and tinder-box, and with the waterpot.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">441. Welcome, O brahmin! Blessed the chance directed you this way;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come, enter with a blessing, come and wash your feet, I pray.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">442. The tindook and the piyal leaves, the kāsumāri sweet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And fruits like honey, brahmin, take the best I have, and eat.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">443. And this cool water from a cave high hidden on a hill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14099"></a><span class="t12">O noble brahmin, take of it, drink if it be your will.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After these words, the Great Being thought: &ldquo;Not without cause is this brahmin come to this great forest; I will ask him the reason without delay,&rdquo; and he recited this verse:<span class="t18"> {6.543}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">444. &ldquo;Now tell me what may be the cause, what can the reason be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That brings you to this mighty wood? I pray you tell to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Jūjaka said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">445. &ldquo;As a great water-flood is full, and fails not any day,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So you, from whom I come to beg &ndash; give me your children, pray!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a14100"></a>On hearing this, the Great Being was delighted in heart; and said, like one who sets in the outstretched hand a purse of a thousand pieces of money:<a id="a14101"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17863"><span class="t9">{1732}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">446. &ldquo;I give, and shrink not: you shall be their master. But my queen</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">448. Stay here this night: the morning light shall see you on your way.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Decked out with flowers they both shall be, with scents and perfumes sweet;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Take them away, and plenty take of fruits and roots to eat.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Jūjaka said:<span class="t18"> {6.544}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">449. &ldquo;No, mighty monarch, I would go; I do not wish to stay:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ll go, lest some impediment should thwart me in the way.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">450. Women no generous givers are, to thwart they always try,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They know all sorts of cunning spells, and always go awry.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">451. Let him who gives a gift in faith not see his mother&rsquo;s face,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or she will find impediments: O king, I&rsquo;d go apace.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">452. Give me your children; let them not behold their mother&rsquo;s face:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He who gives wealth to such as I, up to heaven goes apace.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Vessantara said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">454. &ldquo;If you wish not to see my wife, a faithful wife is she!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let Jāli and Kaṇhājinā their grandfather go and see.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">455. When these fair children, sweet of speech, shall come within his sight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He&rsquo;ll give you wealth in plenty, full of joy and high delight.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Jūjaka said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">456. &ldquo;I fear the spoiling of my goods: O prince, I pray you hear!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The king may deal me punishment, may slay, or sell, I fear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Without wealth and servants, my wife would mock at me, and jeer!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{6.545}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Vessantara said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">457. &ldquo;When these fair children, sweet of speech, shall come within his sight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The foster-king of Sivi folk, who always does the right,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Will give you wealth in plenty, filled with pleasure and delight.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Jūjaka said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">458. &ldquo;No, no, I will not do this thing which you would recommend:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ll take the children, on my wife as servants to attend.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The children, hearing these harsh words, slunk behind the hut, and away they ran from behind the hut, and hid close to a clump of bushes. Even there they seemed to see themselves caught by Jūjaka: trembling, they could not keep still anywhere, but ran here and there, until they came to the bank of the square lake; where, wrapping the bark garments tightly about them, they plunged into the water and stood there concealed, their heads hidden under the lily leaves.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">459. &ldquo;So Jāli and Kaṇhājinā here and there ran,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In deep distress to hear the voice of the pursuing man.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And Jūjaka, when he saw nothing of the children, upbraided the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Ho, Vessantara! When you gave me the children just now, <span class="t18">[6.282] </span>as soon as I told you that I would not go to the city of Jetuttara, but would make the children my wife&rsquo;s attendants, you made them some sign, and caused them to run away, sitting there like innocence itself! Such a liar there is not in the world, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo; The Great Being was moved. &ldquo;They have run away, no doubt,&rdquo; he thought, and said aloud, &ldquo;Do not trouble about it, sir, I&rsquo;ll fetch them.&rdquo; So he arose and went behind the hut; perceiving that they must have fled to the woods, <span class="t18">{6.546}</span> he followed their footprints to the lakeside, and then seeing a footprint where they went down into the water, he perceived that they must have gone into the water: so he called, &ldquo;Jāli, my boy!&rdquo; reciting these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">460. &ldquo;Come hither, my beloved son, my perfect state fulfil;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come now and consecrate my heart, and follow out my will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">461. Be you my ship to ferry me safe o&rsquo;er existence&rsquo;s sea,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beyond the worlds of birth and gods I&rsquo;ll cross and I&rsquo;ll be free.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;Come, Jāli, my boy!&rdquo; cried he; and the lad hearing his voice thought thus, &ldquo;Let the brahmin do with me what he will, I will not quarrel with my father!&rdquo; He raised his head, parted the lily-leaves, and came out of the water, throwing himself upon the Great Being&rsquo;s right foot; embracing the ankle he wept. Then the Great Being said: &ldquo;My boy, where is your sister?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Father, all creatures take care of themselves in time of danger.&rdquo; The Great Being recognized that the children must have made a bargain together, and he cried out, &ldquo;Here, Kaṇhā!&rdquo; reciting two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">462. &ldquo;Come hither, my beloved girl, my perfect state fulfil,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come now and consecrate my heart, and follow out my will.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">463. Be you my ship to ferry me safe o&rsquo;er existence&rsquo;s sea,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14104"></a><span class="t12">Beyond the worlds of men and gods I&rsquo;ll cross and lift</span><a id="a14105"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17867"><span class="t19">{1734}</span></a><span class="t12"> me free!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">She also thought: &ldquo;I will not quarrel with my father,&rdquo; and in a moment out she came, and falling on her father&rsquo;s left foot clasped his ankle and wept. Their tears fell upon the Great Being&rsquo;s feet, coloured like a lily-leaf; and his tears fell on their backs, which had the colour of golden slabs. Then the Great Being raised up his children and comforted them, saying: &ldquo;My son Jāli, don&rsquo;t you know that I have gladly given you away? Behave well so do that my desire may attain fulfilment.&rdquo; And then and there he put a price on the children, as one puts a price on cattle.</p>
<p class="p7">To his son he said: &ldquo;Son Jāli, if you wish to become free, you must pay the brahmin <span class="t18">{6.547}</span><a id="a14106"></a> a thousand pieces of gold.<a id="a14107"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17869"><span class="t9">{1735}</span></a> But your sister is very beautiful; if any person of low birth should give the brahmin so and so much to make her free, he would break her birthright. None but a king <span class="t18">[6.283] </span>can give all things by the hundred; therefore if your sister would be free let her pay the brahmin a hundred male and a hundred female slaves, with elephants, horses, bulls, and gold pieces, all a hundred each.&rdquo; Thus did he price the children, and comforted them, and took them back to the hermitage. Then he took water in his waterpot, and calling the brahmin to come near, he poured out the water, praying that he might attain omniscience. &ldquo;Dearer than my son a hundredfold, a thousandfold, a hundred thousandfold is omniscience!&rdquo; he cried, making the earth resound, and to the brahmin he gave this precious gift of his children.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">464-465. &ldquo;The foster-king of Sivi land then took his children both,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And gave this gift most precious to the brahmin, nothing loth.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">466. Then was there terror and affright, and the great earth did quake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What time the king with folded hands bestowed the children both;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">467. Then was there terror and affright, and the great earth did shake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When Sivi&rsquo;s king his children gave the brahmin, nothing loth.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.548}</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the Great Being had made the gift, he was joyful, thinking how good a gift he had made, as he stood looking upon the children. And Jūjaka went into the jungle, and bit off a creeper, and with it he bound the boy&rsquo;s right hand to the girl&rsquo;s left, and drove them away beating them with the ends of the creeper.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">468. &ldquo;The cruel brahmin bit a length of creeper off; which done,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14108"></a><span class="t12">He with the creeper bound their hands, and dragged the children on.</span><a id="a14109"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17871"><span class="t19">{1736}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">469. And then the brahmin, staff in hand, holding the creeper tight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beat them and drove them on and on before their father&rsquo;s sight.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Where he struck them, the skin was cut, the blood ran, when struck they staggered against each other back to back. But in a rugged place the man stumbled and fell: with their tender hands the children slipped off the light bond, and ran away weeping to the Great Being.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">470. &ldquo;The children thus at liberty then from the brahmin fly;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The boy looks on his father&rsquo;s face, the tears are in his eye.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">471. Then like a fig-leaf in the wind the little boy did quake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Embracing threw his arms around his father&rsquo;s feet, and spake:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">472. &lsquo;Father, will you dispose of us while mother is away?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O do not give us till she come! Till she return, O stay!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">473. And will you then dispose of us while mother is away?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O wait until she shall return, then give us if you will!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then let the brahmin sell us both, then let the brahmin kill!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">474. His foot is huge, his nails are torn, his flesh hangs sagging down,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Long underlip and broken nose, all trembling, tawny-brown,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14110"></a><span class="t12">475. Pot-bellied, broken-backed, with eyes that chew an ugly squint,</span><a id="a14111"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17873"><span class="t19">{1737}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All spots and </span><span class="t12">w</span><span class="t12">rinkles, yellow-haired, with beard of bloody tint,</span><span class="t18"> [6.284]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">476. Yellow, loose-jointed, cruel, huge, in skins of goats bedight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14112"></a><a id="a14113"></a><span class="t12">An Amanussa, he was a most terrifying sight; </span><span class="t18">{6.549}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">477. A man, or monstrous cannibal? And can you tamely see</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This Yakkha come into the wood to ask this boon of thee?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">478. And is your heart a piece of stone fast bound about with steel,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To care not when this greedy man, who can no pity feel,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Binds us, and drives us off like kine? At least I would appeal</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">479. That sister Kaṇha, who as yet no trouble knows, may stay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now crying like a sucking fawn lost from the herd away.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.550}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a14114"></a>To this the Great Being answered not one word. Then the boy said, lamenting on account of his parents:<a id="a14115"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17875"><span class="t9">{1738}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">480. &ldquo;I care not for the pain of death, that is the lot of all:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ne&rsquo;er more to see my mother&rsquo;s face, &rsquo;tis this that does appal.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">481. I care not for the pain of death, that is the lot of all:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ne&rsquo;er more to see my father&rsquo;s face, &rsquo;tis this that does appal.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">482-487. Long will my parents mourn and weep, long will they nurse their woe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At midnight and at dawn their tears will like a river flow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No more to see Kaṇhājinā, whom they had cherished so.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">488. Those clusters of Jambu plum trees which droop around the lake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And all the fruitage of the woods this day we do forsake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">489. Fig tree and jack-fruit, banyan broad and every tree that grows,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea! All the fruitage of the woods this day we do forsake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">490. There stand they like a pleasant park, there cool the river flows,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The place where once we used to play, this day we do forsake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">491. The fruit that once we used to eat, the flowers we used to wear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That yonder grow upon the hill, this day we do forsake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">492-493. And all the pretty little toys that once we played with there,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The horses, oxen, elephants, this day we do forsake.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.551}</span></p>
<p class="p6">In despite of these lamentations, Jūjaka came and drove him away with his sister.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">494. &ldquo;The children to their father said as they were led away:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O father! Wish our mother well, and happy be your day!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">495. These oxen, horses, elephants wherewith we used to play,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Give them to mother, and they will somewhat her grief allay.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">496. These oxen, horses, elephants wherewith we used to play,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When she looks on them, will anon somewhat her grief allay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now great pain arose in the Great Being because of his children, and his heart grew hot within him: he trembled violently, like an elephant seized by a maned lion, like the moon swallowed in Rāhu&rsquo;s jaws. Not strong enough to endure it, he went into the hut, tears streaming from his eyes, and wept pitifully.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">497. &ldquo;The warrior prince Vessantara thus gave his gift, and went,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And there within his leafy bower he sadly did lament.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[6.285]</span></p>
<p class="p6">What follow are the verses of the Great Being&rsquo;s lamentation.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">498-499. &ldquo;O when at morning or at eve for food my children cry,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Oppressed by hunger or by thirst, who will their want supply? </span><span class="t18">{6.552}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">500. How will their little trembling feet along the roadway go</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unshod? Who&rsquo;ll take them by the hand and lead them gently so?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">501. How could the brahmin feel no shame, while I was standing by,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To strike my harmless innocents? A shameless man say I!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">502. No man with any sense of shame would treat another so,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Were it a servant of my slave, and I brought very low.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">503. I cannot see him, but he scolds and beats my children dear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">While like a fish caught in a trap I&rsquo;m standing helpless here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">These thoughts came into the Great Being&rsquo;s mind, through his affection for the children; he could not dismiss the pain thinking of how the brahmin cruelly beat his children, and he resolved to go in chase of the man, and kill him, and to bring the children back. But no, he thought: that was a mistake; to give a gift, then to repent because the children&rsquo;s trouble would be very great, that was not the way of the righteous. And the two following verses contain the reflections which throw light on that matter.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">504. &ldquo;He bound his sword upon his left, he armed him with his bow:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bring my children back again; to lose them is great woe.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14116"></a><span class="t12">505. But even if my children die &rsquo;tis wicked to feel pain:</span><a id="a14117"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17877"><span class="t19">{1739}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who knows the customs of the good, yet asks a gift again?&rsquo; &rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.553}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Meanwhile Jūjaka beat the children as he led them along. Then the boy said lamenting:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">506. &ldquo;How true that saying seems to be which men are wont to tell:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14118"></a><span class="t12">Who has no mother of his own is fatherless as well.</span><a id="a14119"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17879"><span class="t19">{1740}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">507. Life&rsquo;s nothing to us: let us die; we are his chattels now,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This cruel greedy violent man, who drives us like his cow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">508. These clusters of Jambu plum trees, which droop around the lake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And all the verdure of the woods, O Kaṇhā, we forsake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">509. Fig tree and jack-fruit, banyan tree, and every tree that grows,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea all the many kinds of fruit, O Kaṇhā, we forsake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">510. There stand they like a pleasant park, there cool the river flows;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The place where once we used to play, O Kaṇhā, we forsake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">511-512. The fruit that once we used to eat, the flowers we used to wear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That yonder grow upon the hill, O Kaṇhā, we forsake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">513. And all the little pretty toys that once we played with there,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The horses, oxen, elephants, O Kaṇhā, we forsake.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [6.286]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Again the brahmin fell down in a rough place: the cord fell from his hand, and the children, trembling like wounded fowls, ran away without stopping back to their father.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">514. &ldquo;Now Jāli and Kaṇhājinā, thus by the brahmin led,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Somehow got free, and then away and on and on they fled.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{6.554}</span></p>
<p class="p6">But Jūjaka quickly got up, and followed them, cord and stick in hand, spitting like the fire at the world&rsquo;s end, &ldquo;Very clever you are indeed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;at running away,&rdquo; and he tied their hands and brought them back.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">515. &ldquo;And so the brahmin took his cord, and so his staff he took,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And brought them back with beating, while the king was forced to look.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">As they were led away, Kaṇhājinā turned back, and lamented to her father. Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">516. &ldquo;Then spake Kaṇhājinā and said: &lsquo;My father, pray you see &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As though I were a home-born slave this brahmin thrashes me!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">517. Brahmins are men of upright life: no brahmin he can be.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A Yakkha sure in brahmin-shape, that leads us off to eat.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And can you stay and see us led to be a Yakkha&rsquo;s meat?&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">As his young daughter lamented, trembling as she went, dire grief arose in the Great Being: his heart grew hot within him; his nose was not large enough, so from his mouth he sent forth hot pantings; tears like drops of blood fell from his eyes. Then he thought: &ldquo;All this pain comes from affection, and no other cause; I must quiet this affection, and be calm.&rdquo; Thus by power of his knowledge he did away with that keen pang of sorrow, and sat still as usual.</p>
<p class="p7">Ere they had yet reached the entering in of the mountains, the girl went on lamenting:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">518. &ldquo;Sore are these little feet of mine, hard in the way we go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The brahmin drives us on and on, the sun is sinking low. </span><span class="t18">{6.555}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">519. On hills and forests, and on those that dwell in them, we call,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We reverently bow to greet the spirits, one and all</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">520-521. That haunt this lake; its plants and roots and creepers, and we pray</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To wish our mother health: but us the brahmin drives away.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If she would follow after us, let her make no delay.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">522. Straight leads unto the hermitage this path by which we go;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And if she will but follow this, she soon will find us so.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">523. You gatherer of wild fruits and roots, you of the knotted hair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To see the empty hermitage will cause you great despair.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">524. Long stayed our mother on her quest, great store she must have found,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who knows not that a cruel man and greedy has us bound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A very cruel man, who now like cattle drives us round.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">525. Ah, had our mother come at eve, and had they chanced to meet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Had she given him a meal of fruit with honey mixed, to eat, </span><span class="t18">[6.287]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14120"></a><span class="t12">526. He would not drive us cruelly, when he his meal had hent:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cruel he drove us, and our feet loud echoed as we went!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14121"></a><span class="t12">So for their mother longing sore the children did lament.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{6.556}</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx36761"></a>Maddī</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a14122"></a>Now whereas the king gave his dearly beloved children to the brahmin, the earth did resound with a great uproar that reached even to Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm and pierced the hearts of the deities which dwelt in the Himālayas, who, hearing the children&rsquo;s lamentation as the man drove them along, thought to themselves, &ldquo;If Maddī come betimes to the hermitage, not seeing her children she will ask Vessantara about it; great will be her longing when she hears that they have been given away; she will run after them, and will get into great trouble: so they instructed three<a id="a14123"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17881"><span class="t9">{1741}</span></a><a id="a14124"></a><a id="a14125"></a><a id="a14126"></a> of the Devaputtas to take upon them the shape of a lion and a tiger and a leopard, and to obstruct<a id="a14127"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17883"><span class="t9">{1742}</span></a> her way, not to let her go back for all her asking until the setting of the sun, that she might only get back by moonlight, guarding her safe from the attacks of lions and other wild beasts.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14128"></a><span class="t12">527. &ldquo;A lion, tiger, a leopard, three creatures of the brake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which heard this lamentation loud, thus each to other spake:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">528. Let not the princess back return at eve from seeking food,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lest the wild beasts should slay her in our kingdom of the wood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">529. If lion, leopard, tiger should the auspicious mother slay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O where would then prince Jāli be, O where Kaṇhājinā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The parent and the children both do you preserve this day.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a14129"></a>They agreed, and obeyed the words of the Devatā. Becoming a lion, a tiger, and a leopard, they lay down near the road by which she must go. Now Maddī was thinking to herself, <span class="t18">{6.557}</span><a id="a14130"></a> &ldquo;Last night I saw a bad dream; I will collect my fruits and roots and get me betimes to the hermitage.&rdquo; Trembling she searched for the roots and fruits: the spade fell from her hand, the basket fell from her shoulder, her right eye went throbbing, fruit trees appeared as barren and barren trees as fruitful, she could not tell whether she were on head or heels.<a id="a14131"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17885"><span class="t9">{1743}</span></a> &ldquo;What can be the meaning,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;of this strangeness today!&rdquo; and she said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">530. &ldquo;Down falls my spade, a throbbing now in my right eye I feel,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The fruitful trees unfruitful seem, all round me seems to reel!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">531. And when she turned at evening time to go, the day&rsquo;s work done,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wild beasts beset her homeward path at setting of the sun.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">532. &ldquo;The hermitage is far, I think, the sun is sinking low</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And all the food they have to eat is what I bring, I know.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">533. And there my prince sits all alone within the leafy hut,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The hungry children comforting: and I returning not.</span><span class="t18"> [6.288]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">534-535. It is the time of evening meal, O woe is me! &rsquo;Tis late:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thirsting for water or for milk my children me await;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">536-538. They come to meet me, standing like calves looking for their dam;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like wild-goose chicks above the lake &ndash; O wretched that I am!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">539. This is the sole and only path, with ponds and pits around:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And I can see no other road now I am homeward bound.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">540. O mighty monarchs of the woods, O royal beasts, I cry,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14132"></a><span class="t12">Be brothers now in righteousness,</span><a id="a14133"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17887"><span class="t19">{1744}</span></a><span class="t12"> and let me safe go by!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">541. I am a banished prince&rsquo;s wife, a prince of glory fair;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As Sītā did for Rāma, so I for my husband care.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">542. When you go home at evening time, your children you can see:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So Jāli and Kaṇhājinā be given once more to me!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">543. Here are abundant roots and fruits, much food I have to chew:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The half I offer now to you: O let me safely go!</span><span class="t18"> {6.558}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">544. A king my father, and a queen my mother &ndash; hear my cry!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be brothers now in righteousness, and let me safe go by!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Devaputtas, observing the time, saw that it was time to let her go; and they rose up and departed. </p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher explained it thus:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">545. &ldquo;The beasts that heard her thus lament with great exceeding woe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In voice of sweet and gentle sound, went off and let her go.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the beasts had departed, she returned to the hermitage. Now it was the night of the full moon; and when she came to the end of the covered walk, where she had been used to see her children, and saw them not, she cried out:<span class="t18"> {6.559}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">546. &ldquo;The children, dusty, close to home, are wont to meet me here</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like calves that seek the mother-cow, like birds above the mere.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">547-549. Like little deer, with pricked-up ear, they meet me on the way:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With joy and happiness they skip and frolic in their play:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">550. As goat and lioness may leave their young, a bird her cage,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To seek for food, so have I done their hunger to assuage:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">551. Here are their traces, close by home, like snakes upon the hill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The little heaps of earth they made all round, remaining still:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">552. All covered up with dust to me my children used to run,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sprinkled with mud, but now indeed I can see neither one.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">553. Like kids to welcome back their dam they ran from home away</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As from the forest I returned; I see them not today.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">554-555. Here they were playing, here this yellow wood apple fruit let fall:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">556-557. These breasts of mine are full of milk, my heart will break withal:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">558. They used to cling about my hips, one hanging from my breast:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How they would meet me, dust-begrimed, at time of evening rest!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today.</span><span class="t18"> [6.289]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">559. In the past this hermitage became our meeting-ground:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But now I see no children here, the whole place spins around. </span><span class="t18">{6.560}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">560-561. My children must be dead! The place so silent has become &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The very ravens do not caw, the very birds are dumb.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Lamenting in this fashion, she came up to the Great Being, and set down the basket of fruit. Seeing him sitting in silence, and no children with him, she said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">562-563. &ldquo;Why are you silent? How that dream comes to my thought again:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The birds and ravens make no sound, my children must be slain!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">564. O sir, have they been carried off by some wild beast of prey?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or in the deep deserted wood have they been led astray?</span><span class="t18"> {6.561}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">565. O do the pretty prattlers sleep? On errands do they fare?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O have they wandered out afar in frolic or in play?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">566. I cannot see their hands and feet, I cannot see their hair:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Was it a bird that swooped? Or who has carried them away?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this the Great Being made no reply. Then she asked, &ldquo;My lord, why do you not speak to me? What is my fault?&rdquo; and said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">567. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis like the wound of arrow-shot, and still more bitter smart</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today!)</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">568. This is a second wound that you have struck me to the heart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That I my children cannot see, that you have nought to say.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">569. And so, O royal prince! This night since you will not reply,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I think my days are done indeed, and you will see me die.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being thought that he would assuage his pain for the children by harsh speech, and recited this verse:<span class="t18"> {6.562}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">570. &ldquo;O Maddī, royal princess born, whose glory is so great,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You went for food in early morn: why come you very late?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">She replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">571. &ldquo;Did you not hear the lion and the tiger loudly roar</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When by the lake their thirst to slake they stood upon the shore?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">572. As in the woods I walked, there came the sign I knew so well:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My spade fell from my hand, and from my arm the basket fell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">573. Then hurt, alarmed, I worshipped all the quarters, one by one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Praying that good might come of this, my hands outstretched in prayer:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14134"></a><span class="t12">574. And that no lion, no leopard, hyena, wolf or bear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Might tear or harry or destroy my daughter or my son.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">575. A lion, tiger, and leopard, three ravening beasts, laid wait</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And kept me from my homeward path: so that is why I&rsquo;m late.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">This was all that the Great Being said to her until sunrise, after which Maddī uttered a long lament:<span class="t18"> {6.563}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">576. &ldquo;My husband and my children I have tended day and night,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As pupil tends a teacher, when he tries to do what&rsquo;s right.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">577. In goatskins clothed, wild roots and fruits I from the forest brought,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And every day and every night for your convenience sought.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">578. I brought you yellow wood apple fruit, my little girl and boy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And many a</span><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t12">ripe woodland fruit, to play and make you joy.</span><span class="t18"> [6.290]</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Join with your little ones, O prince, and eat your portion too.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">580. Give the white lily to your girl, to Jāli give the blue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And see them dance in garlands decked: O call them, Sivi, do!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">581. O mighty monarch! Lend an ear while with delightful sound</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kaṇhājinā sings sweetly, and enters our settling-ground.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">582. Since we were banished, joy and woe in common shared has been:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">583. How many holy brahmins I must have offended sore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of holy life, and virtuous, and full of sacred lore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today!&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.564}</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this lament the Great Being answered not one word. As he said nothing, trembling she sought her children by the light of the moon; and wheresoever they used to play, under the Jambu plum trees or where not, she sought them, weeping the while, and saying:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">584. &ldquo;These clusters of Jambu plum trees, that droop around the mere,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And all the fruitage of the woods &ndash; my children are not here!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">585. Fig tree and jack-fruit, banyan broad, and every tree that grows,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea, all the fruitage of the woods &ndash; my children are not here!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">586-587. There stand they like a pleasant park, there cool the river flows,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The place where once they used to play &ndash; but now they are not here.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">588. The fruit that once they used to eat, the flowers they used to wear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That yonder grow upon the hill &ndash; the children are not there!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">589. And all the little toys that once they played with, there are those,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The oxen, horses, elephants &ndash; the children are not there!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">590. Here are the many hares and owls, the dark and dappled deer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With which the children used to play, but they themselves not here!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">591. The peacocks with their gorgeous wings, the herons and the geese,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With which the children used to play, but they themselves not here!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Not finding her darling children in the hermitage, she entered a clump of flowering plants and looked here and there for them, saying:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">592. &ldquo;The woodland thickets, full of flowers that every season blow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where once the children used to play, but they themselves not here!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">593. The lovely lakes that listen, when the ruddy geese give call,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14135"></a><span class="t12">When lotus white and lotus blue and trees like coral grow,</span><a id="a14136"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17890"><span class="t19">{1745}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where once the children played, but now no children are at all.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.565}</span></p>
<p class="p6">But nowhere could she see the children. Then returning to the Great Being, whom she beheld with his face cast down, she said to him:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">594. &ldquo;The kindling wood you have not split, the fire you have not lit,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor brought the water as before: why do you idly sit?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">595. When I return unto my den my toil is done away,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I cannot see today!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Still the Great Being sat silent; and she distressed at his silence, <span class="t18">[6.291] </span>trembling like a wounded fowl, went again round the places which she had searched before, and returning said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">596-597. &ldquo;O husband mine, I cannot see by whom their death has come:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The very ravens do not caw, the very birds are dumb.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Still the Great Being said no word. And she, in her longing for the little ones, a third time searched the same places quick as the wind: in one night the space which she traversed in seeking them was fifteen leagues. Then the night gave place to dawn, and at sunrise she came again to the Great Being, and stood before him lamenting. The Teacher explained it thus:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">598. &ldquo;When she had traversed in the search each forest and each hill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Back to her husband she returned, and stood lamenting still. </span><span class="t18">{6.566}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">599-601. In hills, woods, caves I cannot see by whom their death has come:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The very ravens do not caw, the very birds are dumb.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">602. Then Maddī, dame of high renown, princess of royal birth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lamenting with her arms outstretched fell down upon the earth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; thought the Great Being, and trembled. &ldquo;Ah, this is no place for Maddī to die! Had she died in Jetuttara city, great pomp there would have been, two kingdoms would have quaked. But I am alone in the forest, and what can I do?&rdquo; Great trouble came upon him; then recovering himself somewhat, he determined to do what he could. Rising up he laid a hand on her heart, and felt it to be still warm: he brought water in a pitcher, and although for seven months past he had not touched her body, in his distress he could no longer keep to the ascetic&rsquo;s part, but with tears in his eyes he raised her head and laid it upon his lap, sprinkling it with water, and massaging her face and bosom as he sat. Then Maddī after a little while regains her senses, and, rising up in confusion, does obeisance to the Great Being, and asks, &ldquo;My lord Vessantara, where are the children gone?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have given them,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to a brahmin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher thus explained it:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">603. &ldquo;He sprinkled her with water as she fell down faint as dead,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And when she had come back again to consciousness, he said.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{6.567}</span></p>
<p class="p6">She asked him, &ldquo;My dear, if you had given the children to a brahmin, why did you let me go weeping about all night, without saying a word?&rdquo; The Great Being replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">604. &ldquo;I did not speak at once, because I shrank to cause you pain.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A poor old brahmin came to beg, and so, of giving fain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I gave the children: do not fear, O Maddī! Breathe again.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">605. O Maddī, do not grieve too sore, but set your eyes on me:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We&rsquo;ll get them back alive once more, and happy shall we be.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">606. Good men should ever give when asked, sons, cattle, wealth, and grain.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Maddī, rejoice! A greater gift than children cannot be.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [6.292]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Maddī replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">607. &ldquo;I do rejoice! A greater gift than children cannot be.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By giving set your mind at rest; pray do the like again:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">608. For you, the mighty fostering king of all the Sivi land,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Amidst a world of selfish men gave gifts with lavish hand.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this the Great Being answered, &ldquo;Why do you say this, Maddī? If I had not been able to set my mind at peace by giving my children, these miracles would not have happened to me,&rdquo; and then he told her all the earth-rumblings and what else had happened. <span class="t18">{6.568}</span> Then Maddī rejoicing described the miracles in these words:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">609. &ldquo;The earth did rumble, and the sound the highest heaven fills,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The lightning flared, the thunder woke the echoes of the hills!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">610. Then Nārada and Pabbata both greatly did rejoice,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14137"></a><span class="t12">Yea, all the Three and Thirty Gods with Sakka, at that voice.</span><a id="a14138"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17892"><span class="t19">{1746}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">611. Thus Maddī, dame of royal birth, princess of high degree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Rejoiced with him: a greater gift than children none can be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a14139"></a>Thus the Great Being described his own gift; and thus did Maddī repeat the tale, affirming that he had given a noble gift, and there she sat rejoicing in the same gift: on which occasion the Teacher repeated the verse, &ldquo;Thus Maddī.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx36990"></a>Sakka</h4>
<p class="p7">As they were thus talking together, Sakka thought: &ldquo;Yesterday Vessantara gave his children to Jūjaka, and the earth did resound. Now suppose a vile creature should come and ask him for Maddī herself, the incomparable, the virtuous, and should take her away with him leaving the king alone: he will be left helpless and destitute. Well, then, I will take the form of a brahmin, and beg for Maddī. Thus I will enable him to attain the supreme height of perfection; I shall make it impossible that she should be given to anyone else and then I will give her back.&rdquo; So at dawn, Sakka went to him.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher explained it thus:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">612. &ldquo;And so when night was at an end, about the peep of day,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sakka in brahmin&rsquo;s form to them first early made his way. </span><span class="t18">{6.569}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">613. O holy man, I trust that you are prosperous and well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14140"></a><span class="t12">With grain to glean, and roots and fruit abundant where you dwell.</span><a id="a14141"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17894"><span class="t19">{1747}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">614. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or from wild beasts of prey have you immunity enjoyed?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">615. &ldquo;Thank you, brahmin &ndash; yes, I am both prosperous and well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With grain to glean, and fruits and roots abundant where I dwell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">616. From flies and gnats and creeping things I suffer no annoy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And from wild beasts of prey I here immunity enjoy.</span><span class="t18"> [6.293]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">617. I&rsquo;ve lived here seven sad months, and you the second brahmin found,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Holding a goat-staff in his hand, to reach this forest-ground.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14142"></a><span class="t12">618. Welcome, O brahmin! Blessed the chance directed you this way;</span><a id="a14143"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17896"><span class="t19">{1748}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come enter with a blessing, come, and wash your feet, I pray.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">619. The tindook and the piyal leaves, and kāsumārī sweet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And fruits like honey, brahmin, take the best I have, and eat.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">620. And this cool water from a cave high hidden on a hill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14144"></a><span class="t12">O noble brahmin! Take of it, drink if it be your will.&rdquo;</span><a id="a14145"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17898"><span class="t19">{1749}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">As thus they talked pleasantly together he asked of his coming:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">621. &ldquo;And now what reason or what cause directed you this way?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why have you sought the mighty woods? Resolve me this, I pray.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka replied, &ldquo;O king, I am old, but I have come here to beg your wife Maddī; pray give her to me,&rdquo; and he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">622. &ldquo;As a great water-flood is full and fails not any day,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So you, from whom I come to beg &ndash; give me your wife, I pray.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this the Great Being did not reply: &ldquo;Yesterday I gave away my children to a brahmin, how can I give Maddī to you and be left alone in the forest!&rdquo; No, he was as though putting a purse of a thousand pieces in his hand; indifferent, unattached, with no clinging of mind, he made the mountain re-echo with this verse:<span class="t18"> {6.570}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">623. &ldquo;Weary am I, nor hide I that; yet in my own despite,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I give, and shrink not &ndash; for in gifts my heart does take delight.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a14146"></a>This said, quickly he drew water in a pitcher, and poured it upon his hand,<a id="a14147"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17900"><span class="t9">{1750}</span></a> and made over Maddī to the brahmin. At that moment, all the portents which had occurred before were again seen and heard.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher thus explained it:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">624. &ldquo;Then he took up a water-jar, the king of Sivi land,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And taking Maddī, gave her straight into the brahmin&rsquo;s hand.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">625. Then was there terror and affright, then the great earth did quake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What time he rendered Maddī for his visitor to take.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14148"></a><span class="t12">626. The face of Maddī did not frown,</span><a id="a14149"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17902"><span class="t19">{1751}</span></a><span class="t12"> she did not massage or cry,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But looked on silent, thinking, &lsquo;He knows best the reason why.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">627. &lsquo;Both Jāli and Kaṇhājinā I let another take,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Maddī my devoted wife, and all for wisdom&rsquo;s sake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">628. Not hateful is my faithful wife, nor yet my children are,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But perfect knowledge, to my mind, is something dearer far.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being looked upon Maddī&rsquo;s face to see how she took it; and she, asking him why he looked upon her, cried aloud with a lion&rsquo;s voice in these words:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">629. &ldquo;From maidenhood I was his wife, he is my master still:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let him to whomso he desire to give, or sell, or kill.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[6.294] {6.571}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka, seeing her excellent resolution, gave her praise; and the Teacher explained it thus:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">630. &ldquo;Thereat spake Sakka, seeing how her wishes did incline:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Conquered is every obstacle, both human and divine.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">631. The earth did rumble, and the sound the highest heaven fills,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The lightning flares, the thunder wakes the echoes of the hills.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">632. Now Nārada and Pabbata to hear this mighty voice,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea, all the Three and Thirty Gods at this hard feat rejoice.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">633. &rsquo;Tis hard to do as good men do, to give as they can give,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bad men can hardly imitate the life that good men live.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">634. And so, when good and evil go to pass away from earth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14150"></a><span class="t12">The bad are born in hell below, in heaven the good have birth.</span><a id="a14151"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17904"><span class="t19">{1752}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14152"></a><span class="t12">635. This is the Supreme Vehicle:</span><a id="a14153"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17906"><span class="t19">{1753}</span></a><span class="t12"> both wife and child were given,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14154"></a><span class="t12">Therefore let him descend</span><a id="a14155"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17909"><span class="t19">{1754}</span></a><span class="t12"> no more, but this bear fruit in heaven.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When thus Sakka had expressed his approval, he thought: &ldquo;Now I must make no more delay here, but give her back and go,&rdquo; and he said:<span class="t18"> {6.572}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">636. &ldquo;Sir, now I give you Maddī back, your fair and lovely wife,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A pair well-matched, and fitted for a most harmonious life.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">637. Like the inevitable bond &rsquo;twixt water and a shell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So you with Maddī; mind and heart are both according well.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">638. Of equal birth and family on either parents&rsquo; side</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here in a forest hermitage together you abide,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That you may go on doing good where in the woods you dwell.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">This said, he went on, offering a boon:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">639. &ldquo;Sakka the king of Gods am I, here come your place to see:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Choose you a boon, O royal sage, eight boons I give to you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">As he spoke, he rose into the air ablaze like the morning sun. Then the Bodhisatta said, choosing his boons:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">640. &ldquo;Sakka, the lord of all the earth, has given me a boon.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pray you my father reconcile, let him recall me soon</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And set me in my royal seat: this the first boon I crave.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">641. May I condemn no man to death, not though he guilty be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Condemned, may I release from death: this second boon I crave.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">642. May all the people for their help look only unto me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The young, the old, the middle-aged: this the third boon I crave.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">643. May I not seek my neighbour&rsquo;s wife, contented with my own,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor subject to a woman&rsquo;s will: this the fourth boon I crave.</span><span class="t18"> [6.295]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">644. I pray you, Sakka, grant long life to my beloved son,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Conquering the world in righteousness: this the fifth boon I crave.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">645. Then at the end of every night, at dawning of the day,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May food celestial be revealed: this the sixth boon I crave.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">646. May means of giving never fail, and may I give alway</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With hearty gladness and content: this the seventh boon I crave.</span><span class="t18"> {6.573}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">647. Hence freed, may I be straight advanced to heaven, then that I may</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No more be born upon the earth: this the eighth boon I crave.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When Sakka, king of Gods, had heard his saying, thus said he;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">648. &ldquo;Ere long, the father whom you love, will wish his son to see.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">With this address, Sakka went back to his own place.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">649. &ldquo;The Mighty One, the King of Gods, this said, Sujampati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14156"></a><span class="t12">After the giving of the boons straight back to heaven went he.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx37109"></a>The Great King</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a14157"></a>Now the Bodhisatta and Maddī lived happily together in the hermitage which Sakka had given them; but Jūjaka, with the children, went on a journey of sixty leagues. The deities watched over the children; when the sun went down Jūjaka used to tie up the children with willows and leave them lying upon the ground, but himself in fear of cruel and wild beasts would climb up a tree and would sit in the fork of the boughs. Then a Devaputta would come to the children in the form of Vessantara, and a Devadhītā in the form of Maddī; they would set free the children, and massage their hands and feet, wash them and dress them, would give them food and put them to rest on a celestial couch: <span class="t18">{6.574}</span> then at dawn they would lay them down again in their bonds, and would disappear. Thus by help of the gods the children went on their way unhurt.</p>
<p class="p7">Jūjaka also was guided by the gods, so that intending to go to the kingdom of Kaliṅga, in fifteen days he came to the city of Jetuttara. The same night, Sañjaya, king of Sivi, dreamt a dream, and his dream was on this fashion: As he was seated in high durbar, a man came and gave him two blossoms into his hand, and he hung them one on either ear; and the pollen fell from them upon his chest. When he awoke in the morning, he asked his brahmins what it meant. They said: &ldquo;Some relatives of yours, sire, who have been long absent, will return.&rdquo; So next morning, after feasting on many a dainty dish, he sat in his durbar, and the deities brought this brahmin and set him in the courtyard of the palace. In a moment the king saw the children, and said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">650. &ldquo;Whose face is this that yellow shines, dry as though fire did scorch,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like some gold bangle &ndash; one as though all shrivelled with a torch?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">651. Both like in body, like in marks &ndash; who can these children be?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like Jāli is the boy, and like Kaṇhājinā is she.</span><span class="t18"> [6.296]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">652. They&rsquo;re like two little lion cubs that from their cave descend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And like each other: and they seem all golden as they stand.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After thus praising them in three verses the king sent a courtier to them, with instructions to bring them to him. Quickly he brought them; and the king said to the brahmin:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">653. &ldquo;Good Bhāradvāja, tell me whence you have those children brought?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Jūjaka said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">654. &ldquo;A fortnight since one gave them me, well pleased with what he wrought.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{6.575}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">655. &ldquo;By what soft speech or word of truth did you make him believe?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From whom these children, chief of all gifts, did you receive?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Jūjaka said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">656. &ldquo;It was the king Vessantara, in forest lands who lives,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gave them as slaves, who like the earth to all suitors freely gives.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">657. &rsquo;Twas king Vessantara who gave his own as slaves to me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To whom all suitors go, as go all rivers to the sea.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, the courtiers spake in dispraise of Vessantara:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">658. &ldquo;Were he at home, it were ill done by any king that&rsquo;s good:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How could he give his children then, when banished in the wood?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">659. O listen to me, gentles all, that here assembled stand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How could the king his children give to serve another&rsquo;s hand?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">660. Slaves male or female he might give, a horse, a mule, a car,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or elephants: but how give those who his own children are?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a14158"></a>But the boy hearing this, could not stomach his father&rsquo;s blame; but as though raising with his arm Mount Sineru smitten by the windblast,<a id="a14159"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17911"><span class="t9">{1755}</span></a> he recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">661. &ldquo;How, grandfather, can he give, when none in his possession are,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Slaves male or female, elephants, a horse, a mule, a car?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king said:<span class="t18"> {6.576}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">662. &ldquo;Children, I praise your father&rsquo;s gift: no word of blame I say.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But then how was it with his heart when he gave you away?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The lad replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">663. &ldquo;All full of trouble was his heart, and it burned hot as well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His eyes were red like Rohinī, and down the teardrops fell.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then spake Kaṇhājinā and said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">664. &ldquo;Father, this brahmin see &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With creepers, like his homeborn slave, my back he loves to beat.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">665. This is no brahmin, father dear! For brahmins righteous be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A Yakkha this in brahmin shape, who drives us off to eat.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How can you see us driven off with all this cruelty?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[6.297]</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king, seeing that the brahmin did not let them go, recited a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">666. &ldquo;You children of a king and queen, royal your parents are:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Once you would climb upon my hip; why do you stand afar?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The lad replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">667. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re children of a king and queen, royal our parents are,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But now a brahmin&rsquo;s slaves are we, and so we stand afar.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">668. &ldquo;My dearest children, speak not so; my heart is parched with heat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My body&rsquo;s like a blazing fire, uneasy is this seat.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">669. My dearest children, speak not so; you make me sorrow sore.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come, I will buy you with a price, you shall be slaves no more.</span><span class="t18"> {6.577}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">670. Come tell me truly as it is, I will the brahmin pay &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What price your father set on you when he gave you away?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The lad replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">671. &ldquo;A thousand pieces was my price: to set my sister free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14160"></a><span class="t12">Of elephants and all the rest</span><a id="a14161"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17913"><span class="t19">{1756}</span></a><span class="t12"> a hundred each fixed he.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king bade pay the price for the children.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">672. &ldquo;Up, bailiff, pay the brahmin quick, and let the price be told:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A hundred male and female slaves, and cattle from the fold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A hundred elephants and bulls, a thousand pounds in gold.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">673. The bailiff paid the brahmin quick, at once the price was told:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A hundred male and female slaves, and cattle from the fold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A hundred bulls and elephants, a thousand pounds in gold.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thereto he gave him a seven-storeyed palace; great was the brahmin&rsquo;s pomp! He put away all his treasure, and went up into his palace, and lay down on his fine couch, eating choice meats.</p>
<p class="p7">The children were then washed and fed and dressed; the grandfather took one on his hip, the grandmother took the other.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">674. &ldquo;The children bought, well washed and dressed, richly adorned, and fed, </span><span class="t18">{6.578}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And set on their grandparents&rsquo; hips, the king then spake and said:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14162"></a><a id="a14163"></a><span class="t12">675-677. &lsquo;Jāli, your parents are we trust both prosperous and well,</span><a id="a14164"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17915"><span class="t19">{1757}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14165"></a><span class="t12">With grain to glean and roots and fruits abundant where they dwell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">678. Have they been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And have they from wild beasts of prey immunity enjoyed?&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The lad replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">679. &ldquo;I thank you, king, and answer thus: my parents both are well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With grain to glean and roots and fruits abundant where they dwell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">680. From flies and gnats and creeping things they suffer not annoy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And from wild beasts of prey they there immunity enjoy.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">681. Wild bulbs and radishes she digs, catmint and herbs seeks she,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With jujubes, nuts, and wood apple fruit she finds us food alway.</span><span class="t18"> [6.298]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">682. And when she brings wild fruits and roots, whatever they may be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We all together come and eat by night and eke by day.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">683. Our mother&rsquo;s thin and yellow grown by seeking for our food,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Exposed to heat, exposed to wind in the beast-haunted wood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">684. Like to a tender lotus flower held in the hand which fades:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14166"></a><span class="t12">Her hair is thin</span><a id="a14167"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17917"><span class="t19">{1758}</span></a><span class="t12"> with wandering amid the forest glades.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">685. Beneath her armpits clotted dirt, her hair in topknot bound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She tends the fire, and clothed in skins she sleeps upon the ground.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus having described his mother&rsquo;s hardships, he reproached his grandfather in these words:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">686. &ldquo;It is the custom in the world that each man loves his son;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But this in one case it would seem your honour has not done.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{6.579}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king acknowledged his fault:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">687. &ldquo;It was ill done of me indeed to ruin the innocent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When by the people&rsquo;s voice I drove my son to banishment.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">688. Then all the wealth which I possess, all that I have in hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be his; and let Vessantara come and rule in Sivi land.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The lad replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">689. &ldquo;Not for my word will he return, the chief of Sivi land:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then go thyself and fill your son with blessings from your hand.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then to his general-in-chief king Sañjaya thus said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">690. &ldquo;My horses, chariots, elephants, and soldiers go prepare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And let the people come around, the family priests all be there.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">691. The sixty thousand warrior lords armed and adorned so fair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dressed up in blue or brown or white, with bloodred crests, be there.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">692-694. Like as the spirit-haunted hills, where trees a plenty grow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Are bright and sweet with plants divine, so here the breezes blow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">695-696. Bring fourteen thousand elephants, with trappings all of gold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With drivers holding lance and hook: as many horse be told.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">697-698. Sindh horses, all of noble breed, and very swift to go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14168"></a><span class="t12">Each ridden by a henchman bold, and, holding sword and bow.</span><a id="a14169"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17919"><span class="t19">{1759}</span></a><span class="t18"> {6.580}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">699. Let fourteen thousand chariots be yoked and well arrayed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their wheels well wrought of iron bands, and all with gold inlaid.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">700. Let them prepare the banners there, the shields and coats of mail,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And bows withal, those men of war that strike and do not fail.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a14170"></a>Thus the king described the constitution of his army; and he gave orders to level the road from Jetuttara away to Mount Vaṅka to a width of eight rods,<a id="a14171"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17921"><span class="t9">{1760}</span></a> and thus and thus to decorate it. He said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">701. &ldquo;Strow lāja flowers all about, and scented garlands strow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let there be pious offerings on the way that he shall go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">702. Each hamlet bring a hundred jars of wine for those who wish,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And set them down beside the road by which my son shall go.</span><span class="t18"> [6.299]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">703. Let flesh and cakes be ready there, soup garnished well with fish,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And set them down beside the road by which my son shall go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">704. Wine, oil, and ghee, milk, millet, rice, and curds in many a dish,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let them be set beside the road by which my son shall go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">705-706. Cooks and confectioners be there, and men to sing or play,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dancers and tumblers, tomtom men, to drive dull care away.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">707. The lutes give voice, the harsh-mouthed conch, and let the people thrum</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On timbrels and on tabours and on every kind of drum.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.581}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus the king described the preparation of the road.</p>
<p class="p7">But Jūjaka ate too much and could not digest it, so he died on the spot. The king arranged for his funeral: proclamation was made through the city by beat of drum, but no relative could be found, and his goods fell to the king again.</p>
<p class="p7">On the seventh day, all the host assembled. The king in great ceremony set out with Jāli as his guide.</p>
<p class="p7">This the Teacher explained as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">708. &ldquo;Then did the mighty host set forth, the army of the land,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And went towards the Vaṅka hill, while Jāli led the band.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14172"></a><span class="t12">709. The elephant of sixty years gave forth a trumpet sound,</span><a id="a14173"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17923"><span class="t19">{1761}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Loud trumpeted the mighty beast what time his girth they bound.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">710. Then rattled loud the chariot wheels, then neighed the horses loud,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As the great army marched along the dust rose in a cloud.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">711. For every need provided well the host marched with a will,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Jāli led the army on as guide to Vaṅka hill.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">712. They entered in the forest wide, so full of birds and trees,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With every kind of flowering plant and any fruit you please.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">713. There when the forest is in flower, a shower of song is heard,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The twitter here and twitter there of many a bright-winged bird.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">714. A night and day they marched, and came to the end of their long road,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14174"></a><span class="t12">And entered on the district where Vessantara abode.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.582}</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx37291"></a>The Acts of the Six Nobles</h4>
<p class="p7">On the banks of lake Mucalinda, prince Jāli caused them to set up a camp: the fourteen thousand chariots he set facing the road by which they came, and a guard here and there to keep off lions, tigers, rhinoceros, and other wild beasts. There was a great noise of elephants and so forth; this the Great Being heard, and scared to death thought he, &ldquo;Have they killed my father and come here after me!&rdquo; Taking Maddī with him he climbed a hill and surveyed the army.</p>
<p class="p7">Explaining this, the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">715. &ldquo;The noise of this approaching host Vessantara did hear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He climbed a hill and looked upon the army, full of fear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">716. &lsquo;O listen, Maddī, how the woods are full of roaring sound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The neighing of the horses hear, the banners see around.</span><span class="t18"> [6.300]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">717. Can they be hunters, who with pits or hunting-nets or knives</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seek the wild creatures in the woods with shouts to take their lives?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">718. So we, exiled though innocent, in this wild forest land,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Expect a cruel death, now fallen into an enemy&rsquo;s hand.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When she had heard these words, she looked at the army, and convinced that it was their own army, she recited this verse to comfort him:<span class="t18"> {6.583}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">719. &ldquo;All will be well: your enemies can do no hurt to thee,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No more than any flame of fire could overcome the sea.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So the Great Being was reassured, and with Maddī came down from the hill and sat before his hut. This the Teacher explained:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">720. &ldquo;Then king Vessantara hereat descended from the hill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And sat before his leafy hut and bade his heart be still.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">At that moment, Sañjaya sent for his queen, and said to her, &ldquo;My dear Phusatī, if we all go together it will be a great shock, so I will first go alone. When you feel that they must be quiet and reassured, you may come with a company.&rdquo; After a little time he told Jāli and Kaṇhājinā to come. He turned his chariot to face the road by which he had come, and set a guard in this place and in that, mounted upon his caparisoned elephant, and went to seek his son.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher explained it thus:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">721. &ldquo;He set his army in array, his car turned to the road,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And sought the forest where his son in loneliness abode.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">722. Upon his elephant, his robe over one shoulder thrown,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Clasping his upraised hands, he went to give his son the throne.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">723. Then he beheld the beauteous prince, fearless, composed in will,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seated before his hut of leaves and meditating still.</span><span class="t18"> {6.584}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">724. Vessantara and Maddī then their father went to greet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As they beheld him drawing nigh, eager his son to see.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">725. Then Maddī made obeisance, laid her head before his feet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then he embraced them; with his hand he stroked them pleasantly.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then weeping and lamenting for sorrow, the king spoke kindly to them.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">726. &ldquo;I hope and trust, my son, that you are prosperous and well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With grain to glean and fruits and roots abundant where you dwell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">727. Have you been much by flies and gnats and creeping things annoyed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And have you from wild beasts of prey immunity enjoyed?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being answered his father:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">728. &ldquo;My lord, the life we had to live a wretched life has been;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">We had to live as best we could, to eat what we could glean.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">729. Adversity breaks in a man, just as a charioteer</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Breaks in a horse: adversity, O king, has tamed us here.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">730. But &rsquo;tis our parents&rsquo; absence which has made our bodies thin,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Banished, O king, and with the woods and forests to live in.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After this he asked the fate of his children.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">731. &ldquo;But Jāli and Kaṇhājinā, your hapless heirs, whom now,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A brahmin cruel, merciless, drives on like any cow, </span><span class="t18">[6.301] {6.585}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">732. If you know anything of these the royal children, tell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As a physician tries to make a man with snake-bite well.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">733. &ldquo;Both Jāli and Kaṇhājinā, your children, now are bought:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I paid the brahmin: therefore be consoled, my son, fear nought.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being was consoled to hear this, and conversed pleasantly with his father.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">734. &ldquo;I hope, dear father, you are well, and trouble comes no more,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And that my mother does not weep until her eyes are sore.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">735. &ldquo;Thank you, my son, I am quite well, and trouble comes no more,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So too your mother does not weep until her eyes are sore.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">736. &ldquo;I hope the kingdom all is well, the countryside at peace,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The animals all strong to work, the rain clouds do not cease.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">737. &ldquo;O yes, the kingdom all is well, the countryside at peace,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The animals all strong to work, the rain clouds do not cease.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">As they thus talked together, queen Phusatī, feeling sure that they must be all relieved from anxiety, came to her son with a great company.<span class="t18"> {6.586}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher explained it thus:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">738. &ldquo;Now while they talked together thus, the mother there was seen</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Approaching to the door afoot, barefooted though a queen.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">739. Vessantara and Maddī then their mother went to greet,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Maddī ran and laid her head before her mother&rsquo;s feet.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">740. The children safe and sound afar then Maddī did espy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like little calves that see their dam loud greetings they did cry.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">741. And Maddī saw them safe and sound: like one possessed she sped,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Trembling, and felt all full of milk the breasts at which they fed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">At that moment the hills resounded, the earth quaked, the great ocean was troubled, Sineru, king of mountains, bent down: the six abodes of the gods were all one mighty sound. Sakka, King of the Devas, perceived that six royal personages and their attendants lay senseless on the ground, and not one of them could arise and sprinkle the others with water; so he resolved to produce a shower of rain. This he did, so that those who wished to be wet were wet, and those who did not, not a drop of rain fell upon them, but the water ran off as it runs from a lotus-leaf. That rain was like rain that falls on a clump of lotus-lilies. <span class="t18">{6.587}</span> The six royal persons were restored to their senses, and all the people cried out at the marvel, how the rain fell on the group of kinsfolk, and the great earth did quake.</p>
<p class="p7">This the Teacher explained as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">742. &ldquo;When these of kindred blood were met, a mighty sound outspake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That all the hills reechoed round, and the great earth did quake. </span><span class="t18">[6.302]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">743. God brought a mighty cloud wherefrom he sent a shower of rain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When as the king Vessantara his kindred met again.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">744. King, queen, and son, and daughter-in-law, and grandsons, all were there,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When they were met their flesh did creep with rising of the hair.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The people clapped their hands and loud made to the king a prayer:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">745. They called upon Vessantara and Maddī, one and all:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14175"></a><span class="t12">&lsquo;Be you our lord, be king and queen, and listen to our call!&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx37390"></a>The City</h4>
<p class="p7">Then the Great Being addressed his father:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">746. &ldquo;You and the people, countryfolk and townsfolk, banished me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When I upon my royal throne was ruling righteously.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king replied, to allay his son&rsquo;s resentment:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">747. &ldquo;It was ill done of me indeed to ruin the innocent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When by the people&rsquo;s voice I drove my son to banishment.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After reciting this verse, he added yet another, to ask for relief from his own sorrow:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">748. &ldquo;A father&rsquo;s or a mother&rsquo;s pain, or sister&rsquo;s, to relieve,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A man should never hesitate his very life to give.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{6.588}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta, who had been desirous of resuming his royalty, but had refrained from saying so much in order to inspire respect, now agreed; whereupon the sixty thousand courtiers, his birthmates, cried out:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">749. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis time to wash, O mighty king &ndash; wash off the dust and dirt!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a14176"></a>But the Great Being replied, &ldquo;Wait a little.&rdquo; Then he entered his hut, and took off his ascetic&rsquo;s dress, and put it away. Next he came out of the hut, and said: &ldquo;This is the place where I have spent nine months and a half in ascetic practices, where I attained the summit of perfection in giving, and where the earth did quake.&rdquo; Thrice he went about the hut rightwise and made the five-fold prostration before it.<a id="a14177"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17925"><span class="t9">{1762}</span></a> Then they attended to his hair and beard, and poured over him the water of consecration, while he shone in all his magnificence like the King of the Devas. So it is said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">750. &ldquo;Then did the king Vessantara wash off the dust and dirt.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Great was his glory: every place quaked that he looked on, those skilled in auspicious words uttered them, they caught up all manner of musical instruments; over the mighty ocean there was a sound like the noise of thunder; the precious elephant they brought richly caparisoned, and girding himself with an expensive sword he mounted the precious elephant, while the sixty thousand courtiers, his birthmates, compassed him around in gorgeous array. <span class="t18">[6.303]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Maddī also they bathed and adorned and sprinkled with the water of consecration, and as they poured the water they cried aloud: &ldquo;May Vessantara protect you!&rdquo; with other words of good omen. </p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher explained it thus:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">751. &ldquo;With well-washed head and goodly robes and ornaments of state,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14178"></a><span class="t12">Girt with his awful sword he rode the elephant his mate.</span><a id="a14179"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17927"><span class="t19">{1763}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">752. And then the sixty thousand chiefs, so beauteous to view,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His birthmates, came about their lord and did obeisance due.</span><span class="t18"> {6.589}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">753. The women then bathed Maddī, and all together pray &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vessantara and Sañjaya preserve you all alway!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">754-755. Thus reestablished, and their past trouble remembering,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There in the pleasant master&rsquo;s land they made a merry cheer.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">756. Thus reestablished, and the past trouble remembering,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Happy and glad the lady went with her own children dear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So in happiness she said to her children:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">757. &ldquo;I only ate one meal a day, I slept upon the ground,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That was my vow for love of you until you should be found.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">758. But now my vow is brought to pass, and now again I pray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What good so ever we have done preserve you both alway,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And may the great king Sañjaya preserve you both alway.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">759. What good so ever has been done by father or by me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By that truth grow you never old, immortal do you be.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.590}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Queen Phusatī said also, &ldquo;Henceforth let my daughter-in-law be robed in these robes, and wear these ornaments!&rdquo; These she sent her in boxes.</p>
<p class="p7">This the Teacher explained thus:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">760. &ldquo;Garments of cotton and of silk, linen and cloth so fine</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Her mother-in-law to Maddī sent which made her beauty shine.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14180"></a><a id="a14181"></a><span class="t12">761-764. Necklet and bracelet, frontlet-piece, foot-bangle, jewelled zone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Her mother-in-law to Maddī sent, wherewith her beauty shone.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">765. And when the princess passing fair her jewellery surveyed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She shone, as shines in Nandana the Devakaññā arrayed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">766. With well-washed head and ornaments and goodly robes to see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14182"></a><span class="t12">She shone, like to some Accharā before the Thirty-Three.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14183"></a><span class="t12">767. As when in Cittalatā Grove</span><a id="a14184"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17929"><span class="t19">{1764}</span></a><span class="t12"> the wind a plantain sways,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The princess of the beauteous lips looked lovely as that tree.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">768. Like as a brilliant-feathered bird that flies the airy ways,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">She with her pretty pouting lips and beauty did amaze.</span><span class="t18"> {6.591}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">769. They brought a fine young elephant, a mighty and a strong,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which neither spear nor battle din could fright, whose tusks were long.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">770. She mounts upon the elephant, so mighty and so strong,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which neither spear nor battle din could fright, whose tusks were long.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a14185"></a>So they two in great pomp proceeded to the camp. King Sañjaya and his innumerable host<a id="a14186"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17931"><span class="t9">{1765}</span></a> amused themselves in hill sports and woodland <span class="t18">[6.304] </span>sports for a whole month. During that time, by the Great Being&rsquo;s glory, no hurt was done in all that great forest by wild beast or bird.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher thus explained it:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14187"></a><span class="t12">771-772. &ldquo;By glory of Vessantara, through all that mighty wood,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No beast or bird did any harm to the others, all did good.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">773-776. And when he was to go away, they all with one consent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Birds, beasts, and all the creatures of the wood, together went:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But silent were all pleasant sounds when he had left the wood.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.592}</span></p>
<p class="p6">After the month&rsquo;s merry-making, Sañjaya summoned his captain-in-chief, and said: &ldquo;We have stayed a long time in the forest; is the road ready for my son&rsquo;s return?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Yes, my lord, it is time to go.&rdquo; He sent word to Vessantara, and with his army departed, following with all his host the road which had been prepared from the heart of Vaṅka hill to the city of Jetuttara.</p>
<p class="p7">This the Teacher explained as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">777. &ldquo;The royal road was newly made, with flowers and bunting fair arrayed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From where he lived in forest glade down to the town Jetuttara.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">778-779. His sixty thousand mates around, and boys and women places found,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brahmins and vesiyas, homeward bound unto the town Jetuttara.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">780. There many an elephant mahout, the charioteers and men afoot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With all the royal guard to boot were going to Jetuttara.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14188"></a><span class="t12">781. Warriors that skulls</span><a id="a14189"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17933"><span class="t19">{1766}</span></a><span class="t12"> or pelties wore, of mailed men with swords good store,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To guard the prince went on before down to the town Jetuttara.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king traversed this journey of sixty leagues in two months. He then entered Jetuttara, decorated to receive him, and went up to the palace.</p>
<p class="p7">This the Teacher explained:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">782. &ldquo;Then the fair city entered they, with walls and arches high,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With songs and dances, food and drink in plentiful supply.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">783. Delighted were the country folk and people of the town</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To welcome back to Sivi land their prince of high renown.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">784. All waved their kerchiefs in the air to see the giver come;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14190"></a><span class="t12">Now is a goal-delivery proclaimed by beat of drum.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.593}</span></p>
<p class="p6">So king Vessantara set free all creatures, down to the very cats; and on the day that he entered the city, in the evening, he thought: &ldquo;When day dawns, the suitors who have heard of my return will come, and what shall I give them?&rdquo; At that moment Sakka&rsquo;s throne grew hot: he considered, and saw the reason. He brought down a rain of the seven kinds of jewels like a thundershower, filling the back and front of the palace with them waist-high, and over all the city knee-deep. Next day, he allotted this or that place to various families and let them pick up the jewels; the rest he made to be collected and placed in his own dwelling with his treasure; and in his treasuries he had enough to distribute always in future. </p>
<p class="p7">This the Teacher explained as follows: <span class="t18">[6.305]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">785. &ldquo;When as Vessantara came back, Sivi&rsquo;s protector king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The god a shower of precious gold upon the place did bring.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a14191"></a><span class="t12">786. So when Vessantara the prince his generous gifts had given;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He died at last, and fully wise, he passed away to heaven.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a14192"></a><a id="a14193"></a><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse of Vessantara, with its thousand verses, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time, Devadatta was Jūjaka, the lady Ciñcā was Amitatāpanī, Channa was Cetaputta, Sāriputta was the ascetic Accuta, Anuruddha was Sakka, king Suddhodana was king Sañjaya, Mahāmāyā was Phusatī, Rāhula&rsquo;s mother was queen Maddī, Rāhula was prince Jāli, Uppalavaṇṇā was Kaṇhājinā, the followers of Buddha were the rest of the people, and king Vessantara was I myself.&rdquo;</span><a id="a14194"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17935"><span class="t9">{1767}</span></a></p>
