<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present two elders cannot settle a question about which half of the month is cold. They go to the Buddha who explains that he had settled this question for them in a previous life by showing time is not important, the wind is what makes for the cold.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the ascetic who answered the question (pañhavissajjanakatāpasa),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Whether in the dark or bright fortnight.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about two monks who had joined the Saṅgha in their old age. Tradition says </span><span class="t18">{1.165}</span><a id="a1180"></a><a id="a1181"></a><span class="t30"> that they were living in a forest-dwelling in the Kosala country, and that one was named the elder Kāḷa [Dark] and the other the elder Juṇha [Light]. Now one day Juṇha said to Kāḷa, &ldquo;Sir, at what time does what is called cold appear?&rdquo; &ldquo;It appears in the dark half of the month.&rdquo; And one day Kāḷa said to Juṇha, &ldquo;Sir, at what time does what is called cold appear?&rdquo; &ldquo;It appears in the light half of the month.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">As the pair of them together could not solve the question, they went to the Teacher and with due salutation asked, saying: &ldquo;Sir, at what time does what is called cold appear?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1182"></a><span class="t30">After the Teacher had heard what they had to say, he said: &ldquo;Monks, in bygone days also, I answered for you this very same question; but your previous existences have become confused in your minds.&rdquo;</span><a id="a1183"></a><a href="notes.html#a14707"><span class="t9">{234}</span></a><span class="t30"> And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span><a id="a1184"></a><span class="t18"> [1.51]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past at the foot of a certain mountain there were living together in one and the same cave two friends, a lion and a tiger. The Bodhisatta too was living at the foot of the same hill, as an ascetic.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day a dispute arose between the two friends about the cold. The tiger said it was cold in the dark half of the month, while the lion maintained that it was cold in the light half. As the two of them together could not settle the question, they put it to the Bodhisatta. He repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Kāḷe vā yadi vā juṇhe, yadā vāyati māluto,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vātajāni hi sītāni, ubhottha-m-aparājitā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Whether in the dark or bright fortnight, whenever the wind does blow, because the cold is caused by the wind, both are undefeated here.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus did the Bodhisatta make peace between those friends. <span class="t18">{1.166}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended his lesson in support of what he had said as to his having answered the same question in bygone days, he preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof both of the elders won the Fruit of the First Path. The Teacher showed the connection and identified the Jātaka, by saying: &ldquo;Kāḷa was the tiger of those days, Juṇha the lion, and I myself the ascetic who answered the question.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks hear about a Feast for the Dead which involves animal sacrifice, and ask the Buddha if any good can come of it. The Buddha replies that it cannot, and tells a story of a goat who laughed and cried when being prepared for slaughter: he laughed as this was his final punishment for making a sacrifice, and cried in compassion for those who would suffer a similar fate.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a1189"></a><a id="a1190"></a><a id="a1191"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the Tree Devatā (Rukkhadevatā).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a1192"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Restraint, Compassion, Devas, Animals.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;If beings knew thus.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about Feasts for the Dead. For at this time the folk were putting to death goats, sheep, and other animals, and offering them up as what is called a Feast for the Dead, for the sake of their departed kinsmen. Finding them thus engaged, the monks asked the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;Just now, sir, the folk are taking the lives of many living creatures and offering them up as what is called a Feast for the Dead. Can it be, sir, that there is any good in this?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;No, monks&rdquo; replied the Teacher, &ldquo;not even when life is taken with the object of providing a Feast for the Dead, does any good arise therefrom. In bygone days the wise, preaching the Dhamma from mid-air, and showing the evil consequences of the practice, made the whole continent renounce it. But now, when their previous existences have become confused in their minds, the practice has sprung up afresh.&rdquo; And, so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, a brahmin, who was versed in the Three Vedas and world-famed as a teacher, being minded to offer a Feast for the Dead, had a goat fetched and said to his <a id="a1193"></a><span class="t18">[1.52]</span> pupils, &ldquo;My sons, take this goat down to the river and bathe it; then hang a garland round its neck, give it a basket of grain to eat, groom it a bit, and bring it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; they said, and down to the river they took the goat, where they bathed and groomed the creature and set it on the bank. The goat, becoming conscious of the deeds of its past lives, was overjoyed at the thought that on this very day it would be freed from all its misery, and laughed aloud like the smashing of a pot. Then at the thought that the brahmin by slaying it would bear the misery which it had borne, the goat felt a great compassion for the brahmin, and wept with a loud voice. &ldquo;Friend goat,&rdquo; said the young brahmins, <span class="t18">{1.167}</span> &ldquo;your voice has been loud both in laughter and in weeping; what made you laugh and what made you weep?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ask me this question before your master.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So with the goat they came to their master and told him of the matter. After hearing their story, the master asked the goat why it laughed and why it wept. Hereupon the animal, recalling its past deeds by its power of remembering its former existences, spoke thus to the brahmin, &ldquo;In times past, brahmin, I, like you, was a brahmin versed in the mantras of the Vedas, and I, to offer a Feast for the Dead, killed a goat for my offering. All through killing that single goat, I have had my head cut off five hundred times all but one. This is my five hundredth and last birth; and I laughed aloud when I thought that this very day I should be freed from my misery.</p>
<p class="p7">On the other hand, I wept when I thought how, while I, who for killing a goat had been doomed to lose my head five hundred times, was today being freed from my misery, you, as a penalty for killing me, would be doomed to lose your head, like me, five hundred times. Thus it was out of compassion for you that I wept.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fear not, goat,&rdquo; said the brahmin, &ldquo;I will not kill you.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is this you say, brahmin?&rdquo; said the goat. &ldquo;Whether you kill me or not, I cannot escape death today.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fear not, goat; I will go about with you to guard you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Weak is your protection, brahmin, and strong is the force of my evil-doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Setting the goat at liberty, the brahmin said to his disciples, &ldquo;Let us not allow anyone to kill this goat,&rdquo; and, accompanied by the young men, he followed the animal closely about. The moment the goat was set free, it reached out its neck to browse on the leaves of a bush growing near the top of a rock. And at that very instant a thunderbolt struck the rock, rending off a mass which hit the goat on the outstretched neck and tore off its head. And people came crowding round.<span class="t18"> {1.168}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In those days the Bodhisatta had been born a Tree Devatā in that self-same spot. By his supernatural powers he now seated himself cross-legged in mid-air while all the crowd looked on. Thinking to himself. &lsquo;If <a id="a1194"></a><span class="t18">[1.53]</span> these creatures only knew the fruit of evil-doing, perhaps they would desist from killing,&rsquo; in his sweet voice he taught them the Dhamma in this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Evaṁ ce sattā jāneyyuṁ: dukkhāyaṁ jātisambhavo,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Na pāṇo pāṇinaṁ haññe, pāṇaghātī hi socatī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">If beings knew thus: this leads to a rebirth full of suffering, no one would kill living beings, for the slayer of beings grieves.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus did the Great Being preach the Dhamma, scaring his hearers with the fear of hell; and the people, hearing him, were so terrified at the fear of hell that they left off taking life. And the Bodhisatta after establishing the multitude in the Precepts by preaching the Dhamma to them, passed away to fare according to his deeds. The people, too, remained steadfast in the teaching of the Bodhisatta and spent their lives in generosity and other good works, so that in the end they thronged the City of the Devas.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher showed the connection, and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;In those days I was the Tree Devatā.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks hear about a tradition of making a sacrifice following a journey, after making a vow to the gods, and ask the Buddha if any good can come of it. The Buddha replies that it cannot, and tells a story of someone who wanted to make a sacrifice to a Tree Devatā, only to be reproved by that very same god.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;If you would be released after dying.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{1.169}</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about the offering of a sacrifice under vow to gods. Tradition says that in those days folk when going a journey on business, used to slay living creatures and offer them as a sacrifice to gods, and set out on their way, after making this vow, &ldquo;If we come safely back with a profit, we will give you another sacrifice.&rdquo; And when they did come safely back with a profit, the idea that this was all due to gods made them slay a number of living creatures and offer them up as a sacrifice to obtain a release from their vow.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the monks became aware of this, they asked the Fortunate One, saying: &ldquo;Can there be any good in this, sir?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Fortunate One told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past in the Kāsi country the householder of a certain little village had promised a sacrifice to the Devatā of a banyan tree which stood at the entrance to the village. Afterwards when he returned, he slew a number <a id="a1200"></a><span class="t18">[1.54]</span> of creatures and betook himself to the tree to get released from his vow. But the Tree Devatā, standing in the fork of its tree, repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Sace mucce pecca mucce, muccamāno hi bajjhati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Na hevaṁ dhīrā muccanti, mutti bālassa bandhanan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">If you would be released after dying, know that releasing surely binds you, for the wise do not release in this way, such release is only a fool&rsquo;s bondage.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thenceforth, men refrained from such taking of life, and by walking in righteousness thronged thereafter the city of the Devas.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher showed the connection and identified the Jātaka, by saying: &ldquo;I was the Tree Devatā of those days.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks find that the cane sticks their novices collect are useless, as they are hollow throughout. The Buddha tells how this came about in a previous life when through the power of the truth he determined it should be so.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Seeing footsteps that didn&rsquo;t cross.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {1.170}</span><a id="a1208"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while journeying on an alms pilgrimage through Kosala, when he had come to the village of Naḷakapāna (Cane-drink) and was dwelling at Ketakavana near the Pool of Naḷakapāna, about cane-sticks. In those days the monks, after bathing in the Pool of Naḷakapāna, made the novices get them cane-sticks for needle-cases,</span><a id="a1209"></a><a href="notes.html#a14709"><span class="t9">{235}</span></a><span class="t30"> but, finding them hollow throughout, went to the Teacher and said: &ldquo;Sir, we had cane-sticks got in order to provide needle-cases; and from top to bottom they are quite hollow. Now how can that be?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;such was my ordinance in times gone by.&rdquo; And, so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1210"></a><a id="a1211"></a><a id="a1212"></a>In past times, we are told, there was a thick forest on this spot. And in the lake here dwelt a Water Rakkhasa who used to devour everyone who went down into the water. In those days the Bodhisatta had come to life as the king of the monkeys, and was as big as the fawn of a red deer; he lived in that forest at the head of a troop of no less than eighty thousand monkeys <a id="a1213"></a><span class="t18">[1.55]</span><a id="a1214"></a> whom he shielded from harm. Thus did he counsel his subjects, &ldquo;My friends, in this forest there are trees that are poisonous and lakes that are haunted by Amanussas. Mind to ask me first before you either eat any fruit which you have not eaten before, or drink of any water where you have not drunk before.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said they readily.</p>
<p class="p7">One day they came to a spot they had never visited before. As, they were searching for water to drink after their day&rsquo;s wanderings, they came on this lake. But they did not drink; on the contrary they sat down watching for the coming of the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p class="p7">When he came up, he said: &ldquo;Well, my friends, why don&rsquo;t you drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;We waited for you to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1215"></a>&ldquo;Quite right, my friends,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta. Then he made a circuit of the lake, and scrutinized the footprints round, with the result that he found that all the footsteps led down into the water and none came up again. &ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; thought he to himself, &ldquo;this is the haunt of Amanussas.&rdquo; So he said to his followers, &ldquo;You are quite right, my friends, in not drinking of this water; for the lake is haunted by Amanussas.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">When the Water Rakkhasa realised that they were not entering his domain, <span class="t18">{1.171}</span><a id="a1216"></a> he assumed the shape of a horrible monster with a blue belly, a white face, and bright-red hands and feet; in this shape he came out from the water, and said: &ldquo;Why are you seated here? Go down into the lake and drink.&rdquo; But the Bodhisatta said to him, &ldquo;Are not you the Water Rakkhasa who dwells here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Do you take as your prey all those who go down into this water?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I do; from small birds upwards, I never let anything go which comes down into my water. I will eat the lot of you too.&rdquo; &ldquo;But we shall not let you eat us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Just drink the water.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, we will drink the water, and yet not fall into your power.&rdquo; &ldquo;How do you propose to drink the water, then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, you think we shall have to go down into the water to drink; whereas we shall not enter the water at all, but the whole eighty thousand of us will take a cane each and drink therewith from your lake as easily as we could through the hollow stalk of a lotus. And so you will not be able to eat us.&rdquo; And he repeated the latter half of the following verse (the first half being added by the Teacher when, as Buddha, he recalled the incident):</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Disvā padam-anuttiṇṇaṁ, disvānotaritaṁ padaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Naḷena vāriṁ pivissāma, neva maṁ tvaṁ vadhissasī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Seeing footsteps that didn&rsquo;t cross, seeing footsteps that descended, we will drink the water with reeds, but you will surely not kill me.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a1217"></a><a id="a1218"></a>So saying, the Bodhisatta had a cane brought to him. Then, calling to mind the Ten Perfections displayed by him, he recited them in a solemn Assertion of Truth,<a id="a1219"></a><a href="notes.html#a14711"><span class="t9">{236}</span></a> and blew down the cane. <span class="t18">{1.172}</span> Straightaway the cane became <a id="a1220"></a><span class="t18">[1.56]</span> hollow throughout, without a single knot being left in all its length. In this fashion he had another and another brought and blew down them. (But if this were so, he could never have finished; and accordingly the foregoing sentence must not be understood in its literal sense.) Next the Bodhisatta made the tour of the lake, and commanded, saying: &ldquo;Let all canes growing here become hollow throughout.&rdquo; Now, thanks to the great virtues of the saving goodness of Bodhisattas, their commands are always fulfilled. And thenceforth every single cane that grew round that lake became hollow throughout.</p>
<p class="p7">(In this <span class="t11">Kappa</span>, or Era, there are four miracles which endure through the whole Era. What are the four? Well, they are first, the sign of the hare in the moon,<a id="a1221"></a><a href="notes.html#a14713"><span class="t9">{237}</span></a><a id="a1222"></a><a id="a1223"></a><a id="a1224"></a> which will last through the whole Era; secondly, the spot where the fire was put out as told in the Vaṭṭakajātaka [Ja 35], which shall remain untouched by fire throughout the Era; thirdly, on the site of Ghaṭīkāra&rsquo;s house<a id="a1225"></a><a href="notes.html#a14715"><span class="t9">{238}</span></a> no rain shall ever fall while this Era lasts; and lastly, the canes that grow round this lake shall be hollow throughout during the whole of the Era. Such are the four Era-miracles [Kappaṭṭhiyapāṭihāriya], as they are called.)</p>
<p class="p7">After giving this command, the Bodhisatta seated himself with a cane in his hands. All the other eighty thousand monkeys too seated themselves round the lake, each with a cane in his hands. And at the same moment when the Bodhisatta sucked the water up through his cane, they all drank too in the same manner, as they sat on the bank. This was the way they drank, and not one of them could the Water Rakkhasa get; so he went off in a rage to his own habitation. The Bodhisatta, too, with his following went back into the forest.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended his lesson and had repeated what he had said as to the hollowness of the canes being the result of a former ordinance of his own, he showed the connection, and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Devadatta was the Water Rakkhasa of those days; my disciples were the eighty thousand monkeys; and I was the monkey-king, having skill in means.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a1239"></a><span class="t30">For once when the monks were gathered together in the Dhamma Hall, they sat talking reproachfully of Devadatta, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, with a view to destroy the Tathāgata, Devadatta hired bowmen, hurled down a rock, and let loose the elephant Dhanapālaka; in every way he goes about to slay the One with Ten Powers.&rdquo;</span><a id="a1240"></a><a href="notes.html#a14717"><span class="t9">{239}</span></a><span class="t30"> Entering and seating himself on the seat prepared for him, the Teacher asked, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, what is theme you are discussing here in a meeting?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;we were discussing the wickedness of Devadatta, saying that he was always going about to slay you.&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;It is not only in these present days, monks, that Devadatta goes about seeking to slay me; he went about with the like intent in bygone days also &ndash; but was unable to slay me.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as an antelope, and used to live on fruits in his haunts in the forest.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1241"></a>At one period he was subsisting on the fruit of a Sepaṇṇi tree.<a id="a1242"></a><a href="notes.html#a14719"><span class="t9">{240}</span></a> And there was a village hunter, whose method was to build a platform in trees at the foot of which he found the track of deer, and to watch aloft for their coming to eat the fruits of the trees. When the deer came, he brought them down with a javelin, and sold the flesh for a living. This hunter one day marked the tracks of the Bodhisatta at the foot of the tree, and made himself a platform up in the boughs. Having breakfasted early, he went with his javelin into the forest and seated himself on his platform. The Bodhisatta, too, came abroad early to eat the fruit of that tree; but he was not in too great a hurry to approach it. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; thought he to himself, &ldquo;sometimes these platform-building hunters build themselves platforms in the boughs. Can it be that this can have happened here?&rdquo; And he halted some way off to reconnoitre.</p>
<p class="p7">Finding that the Bodhisatta did not approach, the hunter, still seated aloft on his platform, <span class="t18">{1.174}</span> threw fruit down in front of the antelope. Said the latter to himself, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the fruit coming to meet me; I wonder if there is a hunter up there.&rdquo; So he looked, and looked, till he caught sight of the hunter in the tree; but, feigning not to have seen the man, he shouted, &ldquo;My worthy tree, hitherto you have been in the habit of letting your fruit fall straight to <a id="a1243"></a><span class="t18">[1.58]</span> the ground like a pendant creeper; but today you have ceased to act like a tree. And therefore, as you have ceased to behave as becomes a tree, I too must change, and look for food beneath another tree.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Ñātam-etaṁ kuruṅgassa yaṁ tvaṁ Sepaṇṇi seyyasi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Aññaṁ Sepaṇṇi gacchāmi, na me te ruccate phalan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">For the antelope knows who it is drops fruit from the Sepaṇṇi, I will go to another Sepaṇṇi, I do not like your fruit.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Then the hunter from his platform hurled his javelin at the Bodhisatta, crying, &ldquo;Begone! I&rsquo;ve missed you this time.&rdquo; Wheeling round, the Bodhisatta halted and said: &ldquo;You may have missed me, my good man; but depend upon it, you have not missed the reward of your conduct, namely, the eight Large and the sixteen Lesser hells and all the five forms of bondage and torture.&rdquo; With these words the antelope bounded off on its way; and the hunter, too, climbed down and went his way.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse and had repeated what he had said about Devadatta&rsquo;s going about to slay him in bygone days also, he showed the connection and identified the Jātaka, by saying: &ldquo;Devadatta was the platform-hunter of those days, and I myself the antelope.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a1256"></a><a id="a1257"></a><span class="t34">Tradition tells us that she was the daughter of Mahānāma Sakka by a slave girl named Nāgamuṇḍā, and that she afterwards became the consort of the king of Kosala. She conceived a son by the king; but the king, coming to know of her servile origin, degraded her from her rank, and also degraded her son Viḍūḍabha. Mother and son never came outside the palace.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Hearing of this, the Teacher at early dawn came to the palace attended by five hundred monks, and, sitting down on the seat prepared for him, said: &ldquo;Sire, where is Vāsabhakhattiyā?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then the king told him what had happened.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1258"></a><span class="t34">&ldquo;Sire, whose daughter is Vāsabhakhattiyā?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mahānāma&rsquo;s daughter, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;When she came away, to whom did she come as wife?&rdquo; &ldquo;To me, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, she is a king&rsquo;s daughter; to a king she is wed; and to a king she bore her son. Wherefore is that son not in authority over the realm which owns his father&rsquo;s sway? In bygone days, a monarch who had a son by a casual faggot-gatherer gave that son his sovereignty.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">It was to drive home that lesson that he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the result of a past act of the Bodhisatta was that he came to life as a dog, and dwelt in a great cemetery at the head of several hundred dogs.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day, the king set out for his pleasure gardens in his chariot of state drawn by milk-white horses, and after amusing himself all the day in the grounds came back to the city after sunset. The carriage-harness <a id="a1259"></a><span class="t18">[1.59]</span> they left in the courtyard, still hitched on to the chariot. In the night it rained and the harness got wet. Moreover, the king&rsquo;s dogs came down from the upper chambers and gnawed the leather work and straps.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day they told the king, saying: &ldquo;Sire, dogs have got in through the mouth of the sewer and have gnawed the leather work and straps of your majesty&rsquo;s carriage.&rdquo; Enraged at the dogs, the king said: &ldquo;Kill every dog you see.&rdquo; Then began a great slaughter of dogs; and the creatures, finding that they were being slain whenever they were seen, repaired to the cemetery to the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;What is the meaning,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;of your assembling in such numbers?&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;The king is so enraged at the report that the leather work and straps of his carriage have been gnawed by dogs within the royal precincts, that he has ordered all dogs to be killed. Dogs are being destroyed wholesale, and great peril has arisen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1260"></a>Thought the Bodhisatta to himself, &ldquo;No dogs from without can get into a place so closely watched; it must be the thoroughbred dogs inside the palace who have done it. At present nothing happens to the real culprits, while the guiltless are being put to death. What if I were to discover the culprits to the king and so save the lives of my kith and kin?&rdquo; He comforted his kinsfolk by saying: &ldquo;Have no fear; I will save you. <span class="t18">{1.176}</span> Only wait here till I see the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then, guided by the thoughts of love, and calling to mind the Ten Perfections, he made his way alone and unattended into the city, commanding thus, &ldquo;Let no hand be lifted to throw stick or stone at me.&rdquo; Accordingly, when he made his appearance, not a man grew angry at the sight of him.</p>
<p class="p7">The king meantime, after ordering the dogs&rsquo; destruction, had taken his seat in the hall of justice. And straight to him ran the Bodhisatta, leaping under the king&rsquo;s throne. The king&rsquo;s servants tried to get him out; but his majesty stopped them. Taking heart a little, the Bodhisatta came forth from under the throne, and bowing to the king, said: &ldquo;Is it you who are having the dogs destroyed?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it is I.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is their offence, king of men?&rdquo; &ldquo;They have been gnawing the straps and the leather covering my carriage.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you know the dogs who actually did the mischief?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I do not.&rdquo; &ldquo;But, your majesty, if you do not know for certain the real culprits, it is not right to order the destruction of every dog that is seen.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was because dogs had gnawed the leather of my carriage that I ordered them all to be killed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do your people kill all dogs without exception; or are there some dogs who are spared?&rdquo; &ldquo;Some are spared &ndash; the thoroughbred dogs of my own palace.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, just now you were saying that you had ordered the universal slaughter of all dogs wherever found, because dogs had gnawed the leather of your carriage; whereas, now, you say that the thoroughbred dogs of your own palace escape death. Therefore you are following <a id="a1261"></a><span class="t18">[1.60]</span> the four Evil Courses of partiality, dislike, ignorance and fear. Such courses are wrong, and not kinglike. For kings in trying cases should be as unbiassed as the beam of a balance. But in this instance, since the royal dogs go scot-free, while poor dogs are killed, this is not the impartial doom of all dogs alike, but only the slaughter of poor dogs,&rdquo; And moreover, the Great Being, lifting up his sweet voice, said: &ldquo;Sire, it is not justice that you are performing,&rdquo; and he taught the Dhamma to the king in this verse: <span class="t18">{1.177}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Ye kukkurā rājakulamhi vaddhā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Koleyyakā vaṇṇabalūpapannā,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nāyaṁ saghaccā dubbalaghātikāyan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Those hounds reared by the royal family, well-bred and endowed with good looks and strength, these are not slaughtered, but we are slaughtered, this is not just, only the weak are killed.</span></p>
<p class="p23">After listening to the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s words, the king said: &ldquo;Do you in your wisdom know who it actually was that gnawed the leather of my carriage?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; &ldquo;The thoroughbred dogs that live in your own palace.&rdquo; &ldquo;How can it be shown that it was they who gnawed the leather?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will prove it to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do so, sage.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then send for your dogs, and have a little buttermilk and kusa grass brought in.&rdquo; The king did so.</p>
<p class="p7">Then said the Great Being, &ldquo;Let this grass be mashed up in the buttermilk, and make the dogs drink it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1262"></a>The king did so; with the result that each of the dogs, as he drank, vomited. And they all brought up bits of leather! &ldquo;Why it is like a judgment of a Perfect Buddha himself,&rdquo; cried the king overjoyed, and he did homage to the Bodhisatta by offering him the royal umbrella. But the Bodhisatta taught the Dhamma in the ten verses on righteousness in the Tesakuṇajātaka [Ja 521], beginning with the words:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">To friends and courtiers,</span><a id="a1263"></a><a href="notes.html#a14721"><span class="t36">{241}</span></a><span class="t25"> warrior king, do righteously; and so</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t25">With watchful vigilance, O king, on paths of goodness go:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t25">The goddess of all happiness herself to heaven did raise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then having established the king in the Five Precepts, and having exhorted his majesty to be steadfast, the Bodhisatta handed back to the king the white umbrella of kingship.</p>
<p class="p7">At the close of the Great Being&rsquo;s words, <span class="t18">{1.178}</span><a id="a1264"></a> the king commanded that the lives of all creatures should be safe from harm. He ordered that all dogs from the Bodhisatta downwards, should have a constant supply of food such as he himself ate; and, abiding by the teachings of the Bodhisatta, he spent his life long in generosity and other good deeds, so that when he died he was reborn in the Deva Heaven. The &lsquo;Dog&rsquo;s Teaching&rsquo; endured for ten thousand years. The Bodhisatta also lived to a ripe old age, and then passed away to fare according to his deeds.<a id="a1265"></a><span class="t18"> [1.61]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this lesson, and had said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, does the Tathāgata do what profits his kindred; in former times also he did the like,&rdquo; he showed the connection, and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Ānanda was the king of those days, the Buddha&rsquo;s followers were the others, and I myself was the dog.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Though lying on my side.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about a monk who gave up persevering. For it was then that the Teacher addressed that monk and said: &ldquo;Monks, in bygone days the wise and good persevered even amid hostile surroundings, and, even when they were wounded, still did not give in.&rdquo; And, so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a thoroughbred Sindh horse and was made the king&rsquo;s warhorse, surrounded by all pomp and state. He was fed on exquisite three-year old rice, which was always served up to him in a golden dish worth a hundred thousand pieces of money; and the ground of his stall was perfumed with the four odours. Round his stall were hung crimson curtains, while overhead was a canopy studded with stars of gold. On the walls were festooned wreaths and garlands of fragrant flowers; and a lamp fed with scented oil was always burning there.</p>
<p class="p7">Now all the kings round coveted the kingdom of Benares. Once seven kings encompassed Benares, and sent a missive to the king, saying: &ldquo;Either yield up your kingdom to us or give battle.&rdquo; Assembling his ministers, the king of Benares laid the matter before them, and asked them what he was to do. They said: &ldquo;You ought not to go out to do battle in person, sire, in the first instance. <span class="t18">{1.179}</span> Dispatch such and such a knight out first to fight them; and later on, if he fails, we will decide what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king sent for that knight and said to him, &ldquo;Can you fight the seven kings, my dear knight?&rdquo; Said he, &ldquo;Give me but your noble warhorse, and then I could fight not seven kings only, but all the kings in Jambudīpa.&rdquo; &ldquo;My dear knight, take my warhorse or any other horse you please, and do battle.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good, my sovereign lord,&rdquo; said the knight; and with a bow he passed down from the upper chambers of the palace.</p>
<p class="p7">Then he had the noble warhorse led out and sheathed in mail, arming himself too from head to foot, <a id="a1277"></a><span class="t18">[1.62]</span> and girding on his sword. Mounted on his noble steed he passed out of the city-gate, and with a lightning charge broke down the first camp, taking one king alive and bringing him back a prisoner to the soldiers&rsquo; custody. Returning to the field, he broke down the second and the third camps, and so on until he captured alive five kings. The sixth camp he had just broken down, and had captured the sixth king, when his warhorse received a wound, which streamed with blood and caused the noble animal sharp pain. Perceiving that the horse was wounded, the knight made it lie down at the king&rsquo;s gate, loosened its mail, and set about arming another horse.</p>
<p class="p7">As the Bodhisatta lay at full length on his side, he opened his eyes, and gathered what the knight was doing. &ldquo;My rider,&rdquo; thought he to himself, &ldquo;is arming another horse. That other horse will never be able to break down the seventh camp and capture the seventh king; he will lose all that I have accomplished. This peerless knight will be slain; and the king, too, will fall into the hands of the foe. I alone, and no other horse, can break down that seventh camp and capture the seventh king.&rdquo; So, as he lay there, he called to the knight, and said: &ldquo;Sir knight, there is no horse but I who can break down the seventh camp and capture the seventh king. I will not throw away what I have already done; only have me set upon my feet and clad again in my armour.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated this verse: <span class="t18">{1.180}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Api passena semāno, sallebhi sallalīkato,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seyyo va vaḷavā bhojjho, yuñja maṁ yeva sārathī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Though lying on my side, and pierced by arrows, a well-bred horse beats a mare, harness me, driver.</span></p>
<p class="p23">The knight had the Bodhisatta set upon his feet, bound up his wound, and armed him again in proof. Mounted on the warhorse, he broke down the seventh camp, and brought back alive the seventh king, whom he handed over to the custody of the soldiers. They led the Bodhisatta too up to the king&rsquo;s gate, and the king came out to look upon him. Then said the Great Being to the king, &ldquo;Great king, slay not these seven kings; bind them by an oath, and let them go. Let the knight enjoy all the honour due to us both, for it is not right that a warrior who has presented you with seven captive kings should be brought low. And as for yourself, exercise generosity, keep the Precepts, and rule your kingdom in righteousness and justice.&rdquo; When the Bodhisatta had thus exhorted the king, they took off his mail; but when they were taking it off piecemeal, he passed away.</p>
<p class="p7">The king had the body burned with all respect, and bestowed great honour on the knight, and sent the seven kings to their homes after exacting from each an oath never to war against him any more. And he ruled his kingdom in righteousness and justice, passing away when his life closed to fare thereafter according to his deeds.<a id="a1278"></a><span class="t18"> [1.63]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the Teacher said: &ldquo;Thus, monks, in bygone days the wise and good persevered even amid hostile surroundings, and, even when wounded so grievously, still did not give in. Whereas you who have devoted yourself to so saving a dispensation &ndash; how comes it that you give up persevering?&rdquo; After which, he preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof the faint-hearted monk became an Arahat. His lesson ended, the Teacher </span><span class="t18">{1.181}</span><span class="t30"> showed the connection, and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Ānanda was the king of those days, Sāriputta the knight, and I myself the thoroughbred Sindh horse.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, there were seven kings who encompassed the city, just as in the foregoing story.</p>
<p class="p7">So a warrior who fought from a chariot harnessed two Sindh horses (a pair of brothers), and, sallying from the city, broke down six camps and captured six kings. Just at this juncture the elder horse was wounded. On drove the charioteer till he reached the king&rsquo;s gate, where he took the elder brother out of the chariot, and, after unfastening the horse&rsquo;s mail as he lay upon one side, set to work to arm another horse. Realising the warrior&rsquo;s intent, the Bodhisatta had the same thoughts pass through his head as in the foregoing story, and sending for the charioteer, repeated this verse, as he lay:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Yadā yadā, yattha yadā, yattha yattha, yadā yadā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ājañño kurute vegaṁ, hāyanti tattha vāḷavā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Whenever the time, wherever, wherever the place, whenever, the thoroughbred is energetic, the mare fades right there.</span></p>
<p class="p23">The charioteer had the Bodhisatta set on his feet and harnessed. Then he broke down the seventh camp and took prisoner the seventh king, with whom he drove away <span class="t18">{1.182}</span> to the king&rsquo;s gate, and there took out the noble horse. As he lay upon one side, the Bodhisatta gave the same counsels to the king as in the foregoing story, and then expired. The king had the body burned with all respect, lavished honours on the charioteer, and <a id="a1287"></a><span class="t18">[1.64]</span> after ruling his kingdom in righteousness passed away to fare thereafter according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Truths, at the close whereof that monk became an Arahat; and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The elder Ānanda was the king, and the Perfect Buddha was the horse of those days.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;In different places.&rdquo;</span><a id="a1295"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about an ex-goldsmith, who had become a monk and was co-resident with (Sāriputta) the Captain of the Dhamma.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now, it is only a Buddha who has knowledge of the hearts and can read the thoughts of men; and therefore through lack of this power, the Captain of the Dhamma had so little knowledge of the heart and thoughts of his co-resident, as to prescribe impurity as theme for meditation. This was no good to that monk. The reason why it was no good to him was that, according to tradition, he had invariably been born, throughout five hundred successive births, as a goldsmith; and, consequently, the cumulative effect of seeing absolutely pure gold for so long a time had made theme of impurity useless. He spent four months without being able to get so much as the first inkling of the idea. Finding himself unable to confer Arahatship on his co-resident, the Captain of the Dhamma thought to himself, &ldquo;This must certainly be one whom none but a Buddha can convert; I will take him to the Tathāgata.&rdquo; So at early dawn he came with the monk to the Teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;What can it be, Sāriputta,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;that has brought you here with this monk?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, I gave him a theme for meditation, and after four months he has not attained to so much as the first inkling of the idea; so I brought him to you, thinking that here was one whom none but a Buddha can convert.&rdquo; &ldquo;What meditation, Sāriputta, did you prescribe for him?&rdquo; &ldquo;The meditation on impurity, Fortunate One.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sāriputta, it is not yours to have knowledge of the hearts and to read the thoughts of men. Depart now alone, and in the evening come back to fetch your co-resident.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After thus dismissing the elder, the Teacher had that monk clad in a nice under-robe and a robe, kept him constantly at his side when he went into town for alms, and saw that he received choice food of all kinds. Returning to the monastery once more, surrounded by the monks, the Teacher retired during the daytime </span><span class="t18">{1.183}</span><span class="t30"> to his perfumed chamber, and at evening, as he walked about the monastery with that monk by his side, he made a pond appear and in it a great clump of lotuses out of which grew a great lotus-flower. &ldquo;Sit here, monk,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and gaze at this flower.&rdquo; And, leaving the monk seated thus, he retired to his perfumed chamber.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">That monk gazed and gazed at that flower. The Fortunate One made it decay. As the monk looked at it, the flower in its decay faded; the Petals </span><a id="a1296"></a><span class="t18">[1.65]</span><span class="t30"> fell off, beginning at the rim, till in a little while all were gone; then the stamens fell away, and only the pericarp was left. As he looked, that monk thought within himself, &ldquo;Even now, this lotus-flower was lovely and fair; yet its colour is departed, and only the pericarp is left standing. Decay has come upon this beautiful lotus; what may not befall my body? Transitory are all compounded things!&rdquo; And with the thought he won Insight.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Knowing that the monk&rsquo;s mind had risen to Insight, the Teacher, seated as he was in his perfumed chamber, emitted a radiant semblance of himself, and uttered this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&ldquo;Pluck out self-love, as with the hand you pluck</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">The autumn water-lily. Set your heart</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">On naught but this, the perfect Path of Peace,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">And that Nibbāna which the Buddha taught.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">At the close of this verse, that monk became an Arahat. At the thought that he would never be born again, never be troubled with existence in any shape hereafter, he burst into a exalted utterance beginning with these verses:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&ldquo;He who has lived his life, whose thought is ripe;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">He who, from all defilements purged and free,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Wears his last body; he whose life is pure,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Whose subject senses own him sovereign lord;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">He, like the moon that wins her way at last</span></p>
<p class="p11"><a id="a1297"></a><span class="t31">From Rāhu&rsquo;s jaws,</span><a id="a1298"></a><a href="notes.html#a14723"><span class="t32">{242}</span></a><span class="t31"> has won supreme release.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">The foulness which enveloped me, which wrought</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Delusion&rsquo;s utter darkness, I dispelled;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&ndash; As, tricked with thousand rays, the beaming sun</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Illumines heaven with a flood of light.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">After this and renewed exalted utterance, he went to the Fortunate One and saluted him. The elder, too, came, and after due salutation to the Teacher, went away with his co-resident.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When news of all this spread among the monks, </span><span class="t18">{1.184}</span><span class="t30"> they gathered together in the Dhamma Hall and there sat praising the virtues of the One with Ten Powers, and saying: &ldquo;Sirs, through not knowing the hearts and thoughts of men, the elder Sāriputta was ignorant of his co-resident&rsquo;s disposition. But the Teacher knew, and in a single day bestowed on him Arahatship together with analytic knowledges. Oh, how great are the marvellous powers of a Buddha!&rdquo; Entering and taking the seat set ready for him, the Teacher asked, saying: &ldquo;What is theme of your discourse here in a meeting, monks?&rdquo; &ldquo;Naught else, Fortunate One, than this &ndash; that you alone had knowledge of the heart, and could read the thoughts, of the co-resident of the Captain of the Dhamma.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is no marvel, monks; that I, as Buddha, should now know that monk&rsquo;s disposition. Even in bygone days I knew it equally well.&rdquo; And, so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares. In those days the Bodhisatta used to be the king&rsquo;s director in things temporal and spiritual.<a id="a1299"></a><span class="t18"> [1.66]</span></p>
<p class="p7">At this time folk had washed another horse, a sorry beast, at the bathing-place of the king&rsquo;s state-charger. And when the groom was for leading the state-charger down into the same water, the animal was so affronted that he would not go in. So the groom went off to the king and said: &ldquo;Please your Majesty, your state-charger won&rsquo;t take his bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king sent the Bodhisatta, saying: &ldquo;Do you go, sage, and find out why the animal will not go into the water when they lead him down.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good, sire,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, and went his way to the waterside. Here he examined the horse; and, finding it was not ailing in any way, he tried to divine what the reason could be. At last he came to the conclusion that some other horse must have been washed at that place, and that the charger had taken such umbrage thereat that he would not go into the water. So he asked the grooms what animal they had washed first in the water. &ldquo;Another horse, my lord &ndash; an ordinary animal.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s his self-love that has been offended so deeply that he will not go into the water,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta to himself, &ldquo;the thing to do is to wash him elsewhere.&rdquo; So he said to the groom, &ldquo;A man will tire, my friend, of even the daintiest fare, if he has it always. And that&rsquo;s how it is with this horse. He has been washed here times without number. Take him to other waters, <span class="t18">{1.185}</span> and there bathe and water him.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Aññamaññehi titthehi assaṁ pāyehi, sārathi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Accāsanassa puriso, pāyāsassa pi tappatī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">In different places let the horse drink, driver, for one sitting too long, e&rsquo;en milk-rice is torment.</span></p>
<p class="p23">After listening to his words, they led the horse off elsewhere, and there watered and bathed him all-right. And while they were washing the animal down after watering him, the Bodhisatta went back to the king. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;has my horse taken his drink and bath, my friend?&rdquo; &ldquo;He has, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why would he not do so at first?&rdquo; &ldquo;For the following reason,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, and told the king the whole story. &ldquo;What a clever fellow he is,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;he can read the mind even of an animal like this.&rdquo; And he gave great honour to the Bodhisatta, and when his life closed passed away to fare according to his deeds. The Bodhisatta also passed away to fare likewise according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended his lesson and had repeated what he had said as to his knowledge, in the past as well as the present, of that monk&rsquo;s disposition, he showed the connection, and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;This monk was the state-charger of those days; Ānanda was the king and I myself the wise minister.&rdquo;</span></p>

Prince Ajātasattu had a monastery built for Devadatta at Gayāsīsa, and every day brought to him </span><span class="t18">{1.186}</span><span class="t30"> five hundred pots of perfumed three-year-old rice flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. All this gain and honour brought Devadatta a great following, with whom Devadatta lived on, without ever stirring out of his monastery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At that time there were living in Rājagaha two friends, of whom one had taken the vows under the Teacher, while the other had taken them under Devadatta. And these continued to see one another, either casually or by visiting the monasteries. Now one day the disciple of Devadatta said to the other, &ldquo;Sir, why do you daily go round for alms with the sweat streaming off you? Devadatta sits quietly at Gayāsīsa and feeds on the best of fare, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. There&rsquo;s no way like his. Why create misery for yourself? Why should it not be a good thing for you to come the first thing in the morning to the monastery at Gayāsīsa and there drink our rice-gruel with a relish after it, try our eighteen kinds of solid victuals, and enjoy our excellent soft food, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1316"></a><span class="t30">Being pressed time after time to accept the invitation, the other began to want to go, and thenceforth used to go to Gayāsīsa and there eat and eat, not forgetting however to return to the Bamboo Grove at the proper hour. Nevertheless he could not keep it secret always; and in a little while it came out that he used to go off to Gayāsīsa and there regale himself with the food provided for Devadatta. Accordingly, his friends asked him, saying: &ldquo;Is it true, as they say, that you regale yourself on the food provided for Devadatta?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;So-and-so said it.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true, sirs, that I go to Gayāsīsa and eat there. But it is not Devadatta who gives me food; others do that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, Devadatta is the foe of the Buddhas; in his wickedness, he has secured the adherence of Ajātasattu and by unrighteousness got gain and honour for himself. Yet you who have taken the vows according to this dispensation which leads to safety, eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness. Come, let us bring you before the Teacher.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1317"></a><span class="t30">And, taking with them the monk, they went to the Dhamma Hall. When the Teacher became aware of their presence, he said: &ldquo;Monks, are you bringing this monk here against his will?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir, this monk, after taking the vows under you, eats the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it true, as they say, that you eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness?&rdquo; &ldquo;It was not Devadatta, sir, that gave it me, but others.&rdquo; &ldquo;Raise no quibbles here, monk,&rdquo; said the Teacher. &ldquo;Devadatta is a man of bad conduct and bad principle. Oh, how could you, who have taken the vows in the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation, eat Devadatta&rsquo;s food, while living in the Teacher&rsquo;s presence? But you have always been prone to being led away, and have followed in turn every one you meet.&rdquo; And, so saying, he told this story of the past.</span><a id="a1318"></a><span class="t18"> [1.68]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta became his minister. In those days the king had a state elephant, <span class="t18">{1.187}</span><a id="a1319"></a> named Mahilāmukha [Damsel-face], who was virtuous and good, and never hurt anybody.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day some burglars came close up to the elephant&rsquo;s stall by night and sat down to discuss their plans in these words, &ldquo;This is the way to tunnel into a house; this is the way to break in through the walls; before carrying off the plunder, the tunnel or breach in the walls ought to be made as clear and open as a road or a ford. In lifting the goods, you shouldn&rsquo;t stick at murder; for thus there will be none able to resist. A burglar should get rid of all goodness and virtue, and be quite pitiless, a man of cruelty and violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">After having schooled one another in these counsels, the burglars took themselves off. The next day too they came, and many other days besides, and held like converse together, till the elephant came to the conclusion that they came expressly to instruct him, and that he must turn pitiless, cruel, and violent. And such indeed he became. No sooner did his mahout appear in the early morning than the elephant took the man in his trunk and dashed him to death on the ground. And in the same way he treated a second, and a third, and every person in turn who came near him.</p>
<p class="p7">The news was brought to the king that Mahilāmukha had gone mad and was killing everybody that he caught sight of. So the king sent the Bodhisatta, saying: &ldquo;Go, sage, and find out what has perverted him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Away went the Bodhisatta, and soon satisfied himself that the elephant showed no signs of bodily ailment. As he thought over the possible causes of the change, he came to the conclusion that the elephant must have heard persons talking near him, and have imagined that they were giving him a lesson, and that this was what had perverted the animal. Accordingly, he asked the elephant-keepers whether any persons had been talking together recently near the stall by night. &ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;some burglars came and talked.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the Bodhisatta went and told the king, saying: &ldquo;There is nothing wrong, sire, with the elephant bodily; he has been perverted by overhearing some burglars talk.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, what is to be done now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Order good men, sages and brahmins, to sit in his stall and to talk of goodness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do so, my friend,&rdquo; said the king. Then the Bodhisatta set good men, sages and brahmins, in the stall, <span class="t18">{1.188}</span> and bade them talk of goodness. And they, taking their seats nearby the elephant, spoke as follows, &ldquo;Neither maltreat nor kill. The good should be long-suffering, loving, and merciful.&rdquo; Hearing this the elephant thought they must mean this as a lesson for him, and resolved thenceforth to become good. And good he became.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, my friend,&rdquo; said the king to the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;is he good now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, your majesty,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;thanks to wise and <a id="a1320"></a><span class="t18">[1.69]</span> good men the elephant who was so perverted has become himself again.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Purāṇacorāna&rsquo; vaco nisamma,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mahiḷāmukho pothayam-anvacāri,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Considering the former thieves&rsquo; word, Mahiḷāmukha roamed round lashing out, considering the word of the restrained, the elephant supreme was established in all virtues.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Said the king, &ldquo;He can read the mind even of an animal!&rdquo; And he conferred great honour on the Bodhisatta. After living to a good old age, he, with the Bodhisatta, passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Said the Teacher, &ldquo;In the past, too, you followed everyone you met, monk; hearing burglars talk, you followed what they said; and hearing the wise and good talk, you followed what they said.&rdquo; His lesson ended, he showed the connection, and identified the Jātaka, by saying: &ldquo;The traitorous monk was Mahilāmukha of those days, Ānanda the king, and I myself the minister.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present a monk and lay disciple are the best of friends, and always associate together.

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;No morsel is sufficient to receive.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a lay-disciple and an aged elder. </span><span class="t18">{1.189}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Tradition says that there were in Sāvatthi two friends, of whom one joined the Saṅgha but used to go every day to the other&rsquo;s house, where his friend used to give him alms food and make a meal himself, and then accompany him back to the monastery, where he sat talking all the livelong day till the sun went down, when he went back to town. And his friend the monk used to escort him on his homeward way, going as far as the city-gates before turning back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The intimacy of these two became known among the monks, who were sitting one day in the Dhamma Hall, talking about the intimacy which existed between the pair, when the Teacher, entering the Hall, asked what was the subject of their talk; and the monks told him. &ldquo;Not only now, monks, are these two intimate with one another,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;they were intimate in bygone days as well.&rdquo; And, so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta became his minister. In those days there was a dog which used to go to the stall of the elephant of state, and eat the gobbets of rice which fell where the elephant fed. Haunting the place for the food&rsquo;s sake, <a id="a1327"></a><span class="t18">[1.70]</span> the dog grew very friendly with the elephant, and at last would never eat except with him. And neither could get on without the other. The dog used to disport himself by swinging backwards and forwards on the elephant&rsquo;s trunk. Now one day a villager bought the dog of the mahout and took the dog home with him. Thenceforward the elephant, missing the dog, refused either to eat or drink or take his bath; and the king was told of it. His majesty dispatched the Bodhisatta to find out why the elephant behaved like this. Proceeding to the elephant-house, the Bodhisatta, seeing how sad the elephant was, said to himself, &ldquo;He has got no bodily ailment; he must have formed an ardent friendship, and is sorrowing at the loss of his friend.&rdquo; So he asked whether the elephant had become friends with anyone.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a very warm friendship between him and a dog.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is that dog now?&rdquo; &ldquo;A man took it off.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you happen to know where that man lives?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta went to the king and said: &ldquo;There is nothing the matter with the elephant, sire; but he was very friendly with a dog, <span class="t18">{1.190}</span> and it is missing his friend which has made him refuse to eat, I imagine.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Nālaṁ kabalaṁ padātave,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Na ca piṇḍaṁ, na kuse, na ghaṁsituṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Maññāmi abhiṇhadassanā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nāgo sneham-akāsi kukkure ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">No morsel is sufficient to receive, no rice, and no grass, and no rubbing down, I think through seeing him regularly, the elephant had affection for the dog.</span></p>
<p class="p23">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the king on hearing this, &ldquo;what is to be done now, sage?&rdquo; &ldquo;Let proclamation be made by beat of drum, your majesty, to the effect that a man is reported to have carried off a dog of which the elephant of state was fond, and that the man in whose house that dog shall be found, shall pay such and such a penalty.&rdquo; The king acted on this advice; and the man, when he came to hear of it, promptly let the dog loose. Away ran the dog at once, and made his way to the elephant. The elephant took the dog up in his trunk, and placed it on his head, and wept and cried, and, again setting the dog on the ground, saw the dog eat first and then took his own food.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Even the minds of animals are known to him,&rdquo; said the king, and he loaded the Bodhisatta with honours.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Thus the Teacher ended his lesson to show that the two were intimate in bygone days as well as at that date. This done, he unfolded the Four Truths. (This unfolding of the Four Truths forms part of all the other Jātakas; but we shall only mention it where it is expressly mentioned that it was blessed unto fruit.) Then he showed the connection, and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The lay-disciple was the dog of those days, the aged elder was the elephant, and I myself the wise minister.&rdquo;</span></p>

This the monks reported to the Fortunate One, who sent for the group of six and asked whether this charge was true. On their admitting its truth, he rebuked them, saying: &ldquo;Monks, hard words gall even animals: in bygone days an animal made a man who had used harsh language to him lose a thousand pieces.&rdquo; And, so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1341"></a>In the past at Taxila in the land of Gandhāra there was a king reigning there, and the Bodhisatta came to life as a bull. When he was quite a tiny calf, he was presented by his owners to a brahmin who came in &ndash; they being known to give away presents of oxen to such-like holy men. The brahmin called it Nandivisāla (Great-Joy), and treated it like his own child, feeding the young creature on rice-gruel and rice. When the Bodhisatta grew up, he thought thus to himself, &ldquo;I have been brought up by this brahmin with great pains, and all Jambudīpa cannot show the bull which can draw what I can. How if I were to repay the brahmin the cost of my nurture by making proof of my strength?&rdquo; Accordingly, one day he said to the brahmin, &ldquo;Go, brahmin, to some merchant rich in herds, and wager him a thousand pieces that your bull can draw a hundred loaded carts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The brahmin went his way to a merchant and got into a discussion with him as to whose oxen in the town were the strongest. &ldquo;Oh, so-and-so&rsquo;s, or so-and-so&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the merchant. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;there are no oxen in the town which can compare with mine for real strength.&rdquo; Said the brahmin, &ldquo;I have a bull who can pull a hundred loaded carts.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s such a bull to be found?&rdquo; laughed the merchant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him at home,&rdquo; said the brahmin. &ldquo;Make it a wager.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the brahmin, and staked <span class="t18">{1.192}</span> a thousand pieces. Then he loaded a hundred carts with sand, gravel, and stones, and tied the lot together, one behind the other, by cords from the axle tree of the one in front to the trace-bar of its successor. This done, he bathed Nandivisāla, gave him a measure of perfumed rice to eat, hung a garland round his neck, and harnessed him all <a id="a1342"></a><span class="t18">[1.72]</span> alone to the leading cart. The brahmin in person took his seat upon the pole, and flourished his goad in the air, shouting, &ldquo;Now then, you rascal! Pull them along, you rascal!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the rascal he calls me,&rdquo; thought the Bodhisatta to himself; and so he planted his four feet like so many posts, and budged not an inch.</p>
<p class="p7">Straightaway, the merchant made the brahmin pay over the thousand pieces. His money gone, the brahmin took his bull out of the cart and went home, where he lay down on his bed in an agony of grief. When Nandivisāla strolled in and found the brahmin a prey to such grief, he went up to him and enquired if the brahmin were taking a nap. &ldquo;How should I be taking a nap, when I have lost a thousand pieces?&rdquo; &ldquo;Brahmin, all the time I have lived in your house, have I ever broken a pot, or squeezed up against anybody, or made messes about?&rdquo; &ldquo;Never, my child.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, why did you call me a rascal? It&rsquo;s you who are to blame, not I. Go and bet him two thousand this time. Only remember not to call me rascal again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">When he heard this, the brahmin went off to the merchant, and laid a wager of two thousand. Just as before, he tied the hundred carts to one another and harnessed Nandivisāla, very spruce and fine, to the leading cart. If you ask how he harnessed him, well, he did it in this way: first, he fastened the cross-yoke on to the pole; then he put the bull in on one side, and made the other fast by fastening a smooth piece of wood from the cross-yoke on to the axletree, so that the yoke was taut and could not skew round either way. Thus a single bull could draw a cart made to be drawn by two. So now seated on the pole, the brahmin stroked Nandivisāla on the back, and urged on him in this style, &ldquo;Now then, my fine fellow! Pull them along, my fine fellow!&rdquo; With a single pull the Bodhisatta tugged along the whole string of the hundred carts <span class="t18">{1.193}</span> till the hindermost stood where the foremost had started. The merchant, rich in herds, paid up the two thousand pieces he had lost to the brahmin. Other folks, too, gave large sums to the Bodhisatta, and the whole passed into the hands of the brahmin. Thus did he gain greatly by reason of the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Thus laying down, by way of rebuke to the Six, the rule</span><a id="a1343"></a><a href="notes.html#a14728"><span class="t9">{244}</span></a><span class="t30"> that hard words please no one, the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, uttered this verse:</span></p>

<p class="p22"><span class="t4">You should surely speak pleasantly, and speak nothing unpleasantly, for the one who spoke pleasantly he pulled a very heavy load, because of that he received wealth and satisfaction, it is said.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">When he had thus ended his lesson as to speaking only words of kindness, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Ānanda was the brahmin of those days, and I myself Nandivisāla.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Teacher, for the confounding of the schismatics having performed a twofold miracle passing marvellous among his disciples, caused faith to spring up in multitudes, then arose and, sitting in the Buddha&rsquo;s seat, declared the Dhamma.

Then, meditating to see whither it was that former Buddhas went when they had done a miracle, and perceiving that it was to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, up he rose from the Buddha&rsquo;s seat, the right foot he placed on the top of Mount Yugandhara, and with his left strode to the peak of Sineru, he began the season of rains under the great Coral Tree, seated upon the yellow-stone throne; for the space of three months he discoursed upon the Abhidhamma to the gods.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1356"></a><a id="a1357"></a><span class="t30">After he had performed the Double Miracle and had made a stay in Heaven, the All-knowing Buddha descended at the city of Saṅkassa on the day of the Great Pavāraṇā</span><a id="a1358"></a><a href="notes.html#a14730"><span class="t9">{245}</span></a><span class="t30"> Festival, and thence passed with a large following to Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1359"></a><span class="t30">Gathering together in the Dhamma Hall, the monks sat praising the virtues of the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, peerless is the Tathāgata; none may bear the yoke borne by the Tathāgata. The six teachers, though they protested so often that they, and they only, would perform miracles, yet not a single miracle did they work. O! How peerless is the Teacher!&rdquo; Entering the Hall and asking theme which the monks were discussing in a meeting, </span><span class="t18">{1.194}</span><span class="t30"> the Teacher was informed that their theme was none other than his own virtues. &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;who shall now bear the yoke borne by me? Even in bygone days, when I came to life as an animal, I was unmatched.&rdquo; And, so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1360"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a bull. And while he was still a young calf, his owners, who had been lodging with an old woman, made him over to her in settlement of their reckoning. She reared him like her own child, feeding him on rice-gruel and rice and on other good cheer. The name he became known by was, &ldquo;Ayyikā Kāḷaka [Granny&rsquo;s Blackie].&rdquo; Growing up, he used to range about with the other cattle of the village, and was as black as jet. The village urchins used to catch hold of his horns and ears and dewlaps, and have a ride; or they would hold on to his tail in play, and mount on his back.</p>
<p class="p7">One day he thought to himself, &ldquo;My mother is very poor; she has painfully reared me, as if I were her own child. What if I were to earn some money to ease her hard lot?&rdquo; Thenceforth he was always looking out for a job. Now, one day a young merchant at the head of a caravan came with five hundred wagons to a ford the bottom of which was so rough that his oxen could not pull the wagons through. And even when he took out the five hundred pairs of oxen and yoked the lot together to form one team, they could not get a single cart by itself across the river. Close <a id="a1361"></a><span class="t18">[1.74]</span> by that ford the Bodhisatta was about with the other cattle of the village, and the young merchant, being a judge of cattle, ran his eye over the herd to see whether among them there was a thoroughbred bull who could pull the wagons across. When his eye fell on the Bodhisatta, he felt sure he would do; and, to find out the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s owner, he said to the herdsmen, &ldquo;Who owns this animal? If I could yoke him on and get my wagons across, I would pay for his services.&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;Take him and harness him, then; he has got no master hereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">But when the young merchant slipped a cord <span class="t18">{1.195}</span> through the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s nose and tried to lead him off, the bull would not budge. For, we are told, the Bodhisatta would not go till his pay was fixed. Understanding his meaning, the merchant said: &ldquo;Master, if you will pull these five hundred wagons across, I will pay you two coins per cart, or a thousand coins in all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">It now required no force to get the Bodhisatta to come. Away he went, and the men harnessed him to the carts. The first he dragged over with a single pull, and landed it high and dry; and in like manner he dealt with the whole string of wagons.</p>
<p class="p7">The young merchant tied round the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s neck a bundle containing five hundred coins, or at the rate of only one for each cart. Thought the Bodhisatta to himself, &ldquo;This fellow is not paying me according to contract! I won&rsquo;t let him move on!&rdquo; So he stood across the path of the foremost wagon and blocked the way. And try as they would, they could not get him out of the way. &ldquo;I suppose he knows I&rsquo;ve paid him short,&rdquo; thought the merchant; and he wrapped up a thousand coins in a bundle, which he tied round the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s neck, saying: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your pay for pulling the wagons across.&rdquo; And away went the Bodhisatta with the thousand pieces of money to his &lsquo;mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that round the neck of Kāḷaka?&rdquo; cried the children of the village, running up to him. But the Bodhisatta made at them from afar and made them scamper off, so that he reached his &lsquo;mother&rsquo; all right. Not but what he appeared fagged out, with his eyes bloodshot, from dragging all those five hundred wagons over the river. The pious woman, finding a thousand pieces of money round his neck, cried out, &ldquo;Where did you get this, my child?&rdquo; Learning from the herdsmen what had happened, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Have I any wish to live on your earnings, my child? Why did you go through all this fatigue?&rdquo; So saying, she washed the Bodhisatta with warm water and rubbed him all over with oil; she gave him drink and regaled him with due victuals. And when her life closed, she passed away, with the Bodhisatta, to fare according to her deeds.<a id="a1362"></a><span class="t18"> [1.75]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When he had ended this lesson to show that the Buddha was unmatched in the past as then, he showed the connection by uttering, after Fully Awakening, this verse: </span><span class="t18">{1.196}</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t34">There was then, we learn, a girl of about sixteen, daughter of a citizen of Sāvatthi, such as might bring good luck to a man, yet no man chose her. So her mother thought to herself, &ldquo;This my daughter is of full age, yet no one chooses her. I will use her as bait for a fish, and make one of those Sākiyan ascetics come back to the world, and live upon him.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At the time there was a young man of good birth living in Sāvatthi, who had given his heart to the dispensation and went forth. But from the time when he had received full ordination he had lost all desire for learning, and lived devoted to the adornment of his person.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The lay sister used to prepare in her house rice gruel, and other food hard or soft, and standing at the door, as the monks walked along the streets, looked out for someone who could be tempted by the craving for delicacies. Streaming by went a crowd of monks who upheld the Three Baskets, including the Abhidhamma and the Vinaya; but among them she saw none ready to rise to her bait. Among the figures with bowl and robe, preachers of the Dhamma with honey-sweet voice, moving like fleecy scud before the wind, she saw not one.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But at last she perceived a man approaching, the outer corners of his eyes anointed, hair hanging down, wearing an under-robe of fine cloth, and an outer robe shaken and cleansed, bearing a bowl coloured like some precious gem, and a sunshade after his own heart, a man who let his senses have their own way, his body much bronzed. &ldquo;Here is a man I can catch!&rdquo; thought she; and greeting him, she took his bowl, and invited him into the house. She found him a seat, and provided rice gruel and all the rest; then after the meal, begged him to make that house his resort in future. So he used to visit the house after that, and in course of time became intimate.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">One day, the lay sister said in his hearing, &ldquo;In this household we are happy enough, only I have no son or son-in-law capable of keeping it up.&rdquo; The man heard it, and wondering what reason she could have for so saying, in a little while he was as it were pierced to the heart. She said to her daughter, &ldquo;Tempt this man, and get him into your power.&rdquo; So the girl after that time decked herself and adorned herself, and tempted him with all women&rsquo;s tricks and wiles. Then the man, being young and under the power of passion, thought in his heart, &ldquo;I cannot now hold on to the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation,&rdquo; and he went to the monastery, and laying down bowl and robe, said to his spiritual teachers, &ldquo;I am discontented.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then they conducted him to the Teacher, and said: &ldquo;Sir, this monk is discontented.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1379"></a><span class="t30">Then the Teacher asked that monk, saying: &ldquo;Is it true, monk, as they say, that you are overcome by passion?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true, sir,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Monk,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;she is your bane; even in bygone days, you met your end and were made into a relish for the company on her marriage-day.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a1380"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as an ox, named Mahālohita [Big Red], on the householder&rsquo;s estate in a certain hamlet. And he had a younger brother who was known as Cullalohita [Little Red]. There were only these two brothers to do all the draught-work of the family. Also, the householder had an only daughter, whose hand was asked in marriage for his son by a gentleman of the town. And the parents of the girl, with a view to furnishing dainty fare <span class="t18">{1.197}</span> for the wedding guests, began to fatten up a pig named Muṇika.</p>
<p class="p7">Observing this, Cullalohita said to his brother, &ldquo;All the loads that have to be drawn for this household are drawn by you and me, my brother; but all they give us for our pains is sorry grass and straw to eat. Yet here is the pig being victualled on rice! What can be the reason why he should be treated to such fare?&rdquo;<a id="a1381"></a><span class="t18"> [1.76]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Said his brother, &ldquo;My dear Cullalohita, envy him not; for the pig eats the food of death. It is but to furnish a relish for the guests at their daughter&rsquo;s wedding, that the family are feeding up the pig. Wait but a little time and the guests will be coming. Then will you see that pig lugged out of his quarters by the legs, killed, and in process of conversion into curry.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Mā Muṇikassa pihayi, āturannāni bhuñjati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Appossukko bhusaṁ khāda, etaṁ dīghāyulakkhaṇan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Do not envy Munika, he eats food ending in misery, being unconcerned eat your chaff, that is the mark of a long life.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Not long afterwards the guests did arrive; and Muṇika was killed and cooked into all manner of dishes. Said the Bodhisatta to Cullalohita, &ldquo;Did you see Muṇika, dear brother?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have indeed seen, brother, the outcome of Muṇika&rsquo;s feasting. Better a hundred, nay a thousand, times than such food is ours, though it be but grass, straw, and chaff; for our fare harms us not, and is a pledge that our lives will not be cut short.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When he had ended his lesson to the effect that the monk had thus in bygone days been brought to his doom by that young woman and had been made into a relish for the company, </span><span class="t18">{1.198}</span><span class="t30"> he preached the Truths, at the close whereof the monk overcome by passion reached the First Path. Also the Teacher showed the connection and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The monk overcome by passion was the pig Muṇika of those days, the young woman is the same in both cases, Ānanda was Cullalohita, and I myself Mahālohita.&rdquo;</span></p>
