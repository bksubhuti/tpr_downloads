The circumstances of the event are like those of the Sāmajātaka [Ja 540].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10422"></a><a id="a10423"></a><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain monk who supported his mother. They say that there was a wealthy merchant at Sāvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, he exclaimed that he would go too.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the Tathāgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parents&rsquo; consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then he thought to himself, &ldquo;I live here distracted &ndash; it is not suitable for me,&rdquo; and he became anxious to reach the goal of insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the son&rsquo;s place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, &ldquo;Tell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchant&rsquo;s family in Sāvatthi.&rdquo; &ldquo;O friend, don&rsquo;t ask for news of that family.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;They say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When he heard the other&rsquo;s words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, &ldquo;O sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;they are my own father and mother, I am their son.&rdquo; &ldquo;O friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you &ndash; do you go and take care of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;For twelve years,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;I have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit: I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for heaven.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from Sāvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to Sāvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: &ldquo;Shall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?&rdquo; Then he said to himself, &ldquo;In old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.&rdquo; So he left the road to Sāvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the Mātiposakasutta [SN 7.19]. As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: &ldquo;If I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, &lsquo;A son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,&rsquo; I went away before without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.&rdquo; So he took his ticket and his ticket-food and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to Sāvatthi and he thought to himself, &ldquo;Shall I first get the gruel or see my parents?&rdquo; He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their round for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, &ldquo;We have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.&rdquo; When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At last the father said to the mother, &ldquo;Go to him; can this be your son?&rdquo; She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: &ldquo;Do not grieve, I will support you,&rdquo; so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, &ldquo;Your complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale &ndash; has some illness come upon you?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;No illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,&rdquo; and he told them the history. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;the Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.&rdquo; When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;So and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.&rdquo; The Teacher sent for the young man of family and said to him, &ldquo;Is it true that you, an ascetic, take the offerings of the faithful and support laymen with them?&rdquo; He confessed that it was true. Then the Teacher, wishing to praise what he had done and to declare an old action of his own, said: &ldquo;When you support laymen whom do you support?&rdquo; &ldquo;My parents,&rdquo; he answered.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On this occasion also the Teacher said, addressing the monks, &ldquo;Be not angry, monks, with this man; wise men there have been of old, who even when born from the womb of animals, being parted asunder from their mothers, refused for seven days to take food, pining away; and even when they were offered food fit for a king, did but reply, &lsquo;Without my mother I will not eat;&rsquo; yet took food again when they saw the mother.&rdquo; So saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as an elephant in the Himālayas region. All white he was, a magnificent beast, and a herd of eighty thousand elephants surrounded him; but his mother was blind. He would give his elephants the sweet wild fruit, so sweet, to convey to her; yet to her they gave none, but themselves ate all of it. When he made enquiry, and heard news of this, said he, &ldquo;I will leave the herd, and cherish my mother.&rdquo; So in the night, unknown to the other elephants, taking his mother with him, he departed to Mount Caṇḍoraṇa; and there he placed his mother in a cave of the hills, nearby a lake, and cherished her.</p>
<p class="p7">Now a certain forester, who dwelt in Benares, lost his way; and being unable to get his bearings, <span class="t18">{4.91}</span> began to lament with a great noise. Hearing this noise, the Bodhisatta thought to himself, &ldquo;There is a man in distress, and it is not good that he come to harm while I am here.&rdquo; So he drew near to the man; but the man fled in fear. Seeing which, the elephant said to him, &ldquo;Ho man! You have no need to fear me. Do not flee, but say why you walk about weeping?&rdquo; <span class="t18">[4.59]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I have lost my way, this seven days gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Said the elephant, &ldquo;Fear not, O man; for I will put you in the path of men.&rdquo; Then he made the man sit on his back, and carried him out of the forest, and then returned.</p>
<p class="p7">This wicked man determined to go into the city, and tell the king. So he marked the trees, and marked the hills, and then made his way to Benares. At that time the king&rsquo;s state elephant had just died. The king caused it to be proclaimed by beat of drum, &ldquo;If any man has in any place seen an elephant fit and proper for the king&rsquo;s riding, let him declare it!&rdquo; Then this man came before the king, and said: &ldquo;I, my lord, have seen a splendid elephant, white all over and excellent, fit for the king&rsquo;s riding. I will show the way; send but with me the elephant trainers, and you shall catch him.&rdquo; The king agreed, and sent with the man a forester and a great troop of followers.</p>
<p class="p7">The man went with him, and found the Bodhisatta feeding in the lake. When the Bodhisatta saw the forester, he thought: &ldquo;This danger has doubtless come from none other than that man. But I am very strong; I can scatter even a thousand elephants; in anger I am able to destroy all the beasts that carry the army of a whole kingdom. But if I give way to anger, my virtue will be marred. So today I will not be angry, not even though pierced with knives.&rdquo; With this resolve, bowing his head he remained immovable.</p>
<p class="p7">Down into the lotus-lake went the forester, and seeing the beauty of his points, said: &ldquo;Come, my son!&rdquo; Then seizing him by the trunk (and like a silver rope it was), he led him in seven days to Benares.</p>
<p class="p7">When the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s mother found that her son came not, she thought that he must have been caught by the king&rsquo;s nobles. <span class="t18">{4.92}</span> &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;all these trees will go on growing, but he will be far away,&rdquo; and she repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Though far away this elephant should go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10424"></a><span class="t12">Still olibane and kuṭaja</span><a id="a10425"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15884"><span class="t19">{784}</span></a><span class="t12"> will grow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Grain, grass, and oleander, lilies white,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On sheltered spots the bluebells dark still blow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Somewhere that royal elephant must go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Full fed by those whose breast and body show</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All gold-bedecked, that king or prince may ride</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fearless to triumph o&rsquo;er the mailclad foe.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now the trainer, while he was yet in the way, sent on a message to tell the king. And the king caused the city to be decorated. The trainer led the Bodhisatta into a stable all adorned and decked out with festoons and with garlands, and surrounding him, with a screen of <span class="t18">[4.60] </span>many colours, sent word to the king. And the king took all manner of fine food and caused it to be given to the Bodhisatta. But not a bit would he eat, &ldquo;Without my mother, I will eat nothing,&rdquo; said he. The king besought him to eat, repeating the third verse: <span class="t18">{4.93}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Come, take a morsel, elephant, and never pine away:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There&rsquo;s many a thing to serve your king that you shall do one day.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, the Bodhisatta repeated the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Nay, she by Mount Caṇḍoraṇa, poor blind and wretched one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beats with a foot on some tree-root, without her royal son.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king said the fifth verse to ask his meaning:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Who is&rsquo;t by Mount Caṇḍoraṇa, what blind and wretched one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beats with a foot on some tree-root, without her royal son?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To which the other replied in the sixth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;My mother by Caṇḍoraṇa, ah blind, ah wretched one!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beats with her foot on some tree-root for lack of me, her son!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And hearing this, the king gave him freedom, reciting the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;This mighty elephant, who feeds his mother, let go free:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And let him to his mother go, and to all his family.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The eighth and ninth verses are those of the Buddha after Fully Awakening:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;The elephant from prison freed, the beast set free from chain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10426"></a><span class="t12">With words of consolation</span><a id="a10427"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15886"><span class="t19">{785}</span></a><span class="t12"> went back to the hills again. </span><span class="t18">{4.94}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Then from the cool and limpid pool, where Elephants frequent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10428"></a><span class="t12">He with his trunk drew water, and his mother all besprent.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But the mother of the Bodhisatta thought it had begun to rain, and repeated the tenth verse, rebuking the rain:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Who brings unseasonable rain &ndash; what evil deity?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For he is gone, my own, my son, who used to care for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta repeated the eleventh verse, to reassure her:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;Rise mother! Why should you there lie? Your own, your son has come!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vedeha, Kāsi&rsquo;s glorious king, has sent me safely home.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And she returned thanks to the king by repeating the last verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;Long live that king! Long may he bring his realms prosperity,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who freed that son who ever has done so great respect to me!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.61]</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king was pleased with the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s goodness; and he built a town not far from the lake, and did continual service to the Bodhisatta and to his mother. Afterwards, when his mother died, and the Bodhisatta had performed her obsequies, <span class="t18">{4.95}</span> he went away to a monastery called Karaṇḍaka. In this place five hundred sages came and dwelt, and the king did the like service for them. The king had a stone image made in the figure of the Bodhisatta, and great honour he paid to this. There the inhabitants of all Jambudīpa year by year gathered together, to perform what was called the Elephant Festival.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, now at the conclusion of the Truths the monk who supported his mother was established in the fruit of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time, Ānanda was the king, the lady Mahāmāyā was the female elephant, and I was myself the elephant that fed his mother.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the Buddha is growing older and is looking for a permanent attendant to help him. All are willing, but the Buddha turns them down. Ven. Ānanda then says he will do it if he is granted eight boons, and he is chosen. The Buddha then tells a story of how a brahmin had asked for several boons from a king in the past, and had been granted his heart&rsquo;s desire.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = king (of Benares) (rājā),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;O king of men.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10437"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana about the boons received by elder Ānanda. During the twenty years of his first Buddhahood the Fortunate One&rsquo;s attendants were not always the same: sometimes elder Nāgasamāla, sometimes Nāgita, Upavāṇa, Sunakkhatta, Cunda, Sāgala, sometimes Meghiya waited upon the Fortunate One. One day the Fortunate One said to the monks, &ldquo;Now I am old, monks: and when I say, &lsquo;Let us go in this way,&rsquo; some of the Saṅgha go by another way, some drop my bowl and robe on the ground. Choose out one monk to attend always upon me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then they all rose up, beginning with elder Sāriputta, and laid their joined hands to their heads, crying, &ldquo;I will serve you, sir, I will serve you!&rdquo; But he refused them, saying: &ldquo;Your prayer is forestalled! Enough.&rdquo; Then the monks said to the elder Ānanda, &ldquo;Do you, friend, ask for the post of attendant.&rdquo; The elder said: &ldquo;If the Fortunate One will not give me the robe which he himself has received, if he will not give me his dole of food, if he will not grant me to dwell in the same fragrant cell, if he will not have me with him to go where he is invited; but if the Fortunate One will go with me where I am invited, if I shall be granted to introduce the company at the moment of coming, which comes from foreign parts and foreign countries to see the Fortunate One, </span><span class="t18">{4.96}</span><a id="a10438"></a><span class="t30"> if I shall be granted to approach the Fortunate One as soon as doubt shall arise, if whenever the Fortunate One shall discourse in my absence he will repeat his discourse to me as soon as I shall return: then I will attend upon the Fortunate One.&rdquo; These eight boons he craved, four negative and four positive. And the Fortunate One granted them to him. </span><span class="t18">[4.62]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10439"></a><span class="t30">After that he attended continually upon his Teacher for five and twenty years. So having obtained the preeminence in the five points,</span><a id="a10440"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15891"><span class="t9">{787}</span></a><a id="a10441"></a><span class="t30"> and having gained seven blessings &ndash; blessing of Dhamma, blessing of instruction, blessing of the knowledge of causes, blessing of inquiry as to one&rsquo;s good, blessing of dwelling in a holy place, blessing of enlightened devotion, blessing of potential Buddhahood &ndash; in the presence of the Buddha he received the heritage of eight boons, and became famous in the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation, and shone as the moon in the heavens.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day they began to talk about it in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Friend, the Tathāgata has satisfied elder Ānanda by granting his boons.&rdquo; The Teacher entered, and asked, &ldquo;What are you speaking of, monks, as you sit here?&rdquo; They told him. Then he said: &ldquo;It is not now the first time, monks, but in former days as now I satisfied Ānanda with a boon; in former days, as now, whatsoever he asked, I gave him.&rdquo; And so saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, a son of his named prince Juṇha, or the Moonlight prince, was studying at Taxila. One night, after he had been listening carefully to his teacher&rsquo;s instruction, he left the house of his teacher in the dark, and set out for home. A certain brahmin had been seeking alms, and was going home, and the prince not perceiving him ran up against the brahmin, and broke his alms bowl with a blow of his arm. The brahmin fell, with a cry. In compassion the prince turned round, and taking hold of the man&rsquo;s hands raised him to his feet. The brahmin said: &ldquo;Now, my son, you have broken my alms-bowl, so give me the price of a meal.&rdquo; Said the prince, &ldquo;I cannot now give you the price of a meal, brahmin; but I am prince Juṇha, son of the king of Kāsi, and when I come to my kingdom, you may come to me and ask for the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">When his education was finished, he took leave of his teacher, and returning to Benares, showed his father what he had learned.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I have seen my son before my death,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;and I will see him king indeed.&rdquo; Then he sprinkled him and made him king. <span class="t18">{4.97}</span> Under the name of king Juṇha the prince ruled in righteousness. When the brahmin heard of it, he thought now he would recover the price of his meal. So to Benares he came, and saw the city all decorated, and the king moving in solemn procession right-wise around it. Taking his stand upon a high place, the brahmin stretched out his hand, and cried, &ldquo;Victory to the king!&rdquo; The king passed by without looking at him. When the brahmin found that he was not noticed, he asked an explanation by repeating the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;O king of men, hear what I have to say!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Not without cause have I come here this day.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis said, O best of men, one should not pass</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A wandering brahmin standing in the way.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.63]</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a10442"></a>On hearing these words the king turned back the elephant with his jewelled goad, and repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;I heard, I stand: come brahmin, quickly say,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What cause it is has brought you here today?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What boon is it that you would crave of me</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That you are come to see me? Speak, I pray!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">What further king and brahmin said to each other by way of question and answer, is told in the remaining verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Give me five villages, all choice and fine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A hundred slave girls, seven hundred kine,</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Have you a penance, brahmin, dread to tell,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or Yakkhas, ready your behests to do,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or any claim for having served me well?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;I cannot call to mind, in time past o&rsquo;er,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell me, I beg you, tell this thing to me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When have we met, or where, in days of yore?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor ever once before, nor ever since.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;I do the right.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10460"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana, how Devadatta was swallowed up in the earth. They gathered in the Dhamma Hall to talk, &ldquo;Friend, Devadatta fell at odds with the Tathāgata, and was swallowed up in the earth.&rdquo; The Teacher entered and asked what they were talking of as they sat there. They told him. He replied, &ldquo;Now, monks, he has been swallowed up in the earth because he dealt a blow at my victorious authority; but formerly he dealt a blow at the authority of the Dhamma, and was swallowed up in the earth, and went on his way to nethermost hell.&rdquo; So saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into the world of the Devaputtas, and was named Dhamma, or Right, while Devadatta was called Adhamma, or Wrong.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10461"></a>As on the Uposatha of the full moon, in the evening when meals were done, men were sitting in enjoyment each at his own house-door in village and city and royal capital, Dhamma appeared before them, poised in the air, in his celestial chariot mounted, and adorned with celestial array, in the midst of a multitude of Accharā, and thus addressed them:</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10462"></a>&ldquo;Take not the life of living creatures, and the other ten paths of evildoing eschew, fulfil the duty of service to mother and the duty of service to father and the threefold course of right;<a id="a10463"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15895"><span class="t9">{788}</span></a> <span class="t18">{4.101}</span> thus you shall become destined for heaven, and shall receive great glory.&rdquo; Thus did he urge men <span class="t18">[4.65] </span>to follow the ten paths of doing right, and made a solemn circuit around Jambudīpa right-wise. But Adhamma taught them, &ldquo;Kill that which lives,&rdquo; and in like manner urged men to follow the other ten paths of evildoing, and made a circuit around Jambudīpa left-wise.</p>
<p class="p7">Now their chariots met face to face in the air, and their attendant multitudes asked each the other, &ldquo;Whose are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;And whose are you?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;We are of Dhamma,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;We of Adhamma,&rdquo; and made room, so that their paths were divided. But Dhamma said to Adhamma, &ldquo;Good sir, you are Adhamma, and I am Dhamma; I have the right of way; turn your chariot aside, and give me way,&rdquo; repeating the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;I do the right, men&rsquo;s fame is of my grace,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Me sages and me brahmins ever praise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Worshipped of men and gods, the right of way</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is mine. Right am I; then, O Wrong, give place!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Make way today for Right to pass me by?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Right am I: Wrong, how can you conquer here?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. By iron gold is beaten, nor do we</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gold used for beating iron ever see:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Swallow I will all these your evil words;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And willy nilly I will make you way.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">These six verses they repeated, one answering the other.<span class="t18"> {4.103}</span></p>
<p class="p7">But at the very moment when the Bodhisatta repeated this verse, Adhamma could no longer stand in his carriage, but head-foremost plunged into the earth which gaped to receive him, and was born again in nethermost hell. <span class="t18">[4.66]</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Fortunate One no sooner perceived that this had happened, than after Fully Awakening he recited the remaining verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;The words no sooner heard, Wrong from the height</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Plunged over heels head-foremost out of sight:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This was the end and direful fate of Wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I had no battle, though I longed to fight.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;You flawless.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10476"></a><a id="a10477"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told, while dwelling in Jetavana, about a discontented monk. The occasion will be explained under the Kusajātaka [Ja 531].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10478"></a><span class="t34">The story tells that he was of noble birth and lived at Sāvatthi, and on his heartily embracing the dispensation he adopted the ascetic life. Now one day as he was going his rounds for alms in Sāvatthi, he met a fair lady and fell in love with her at first sight. Overcome by his passion he lived an unhappy life, and letting his nails and hair grow long and wearing soiled robes, he pined away and became quite sallow, with all his veins standing out on his body. And just as in the Deva world, the Devaputtas who are destined to fall from their heavenly existence manifest five well-known signs, that is to say, their garlands wither, their robes soil, their bodies grow ill-favoured, perspiration pours from their armpits, and they no longer find pleasure in their Deva home, so too in the case of worldly monks, who fall from the Dhamma, the same five signs are to be seen: the flowers of faith wither, the robes of righteousness soil, through discontent and the effects of an evil name their persons grow ill-favoured, the sweat of corruption streams from them and they no longer delight in a life of solitude at the foot of forest trees &ndash; all these signs were to be found in him. So they brought him into the presence of the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;Venerable sir, this fellow is discontented.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Again the Teacher asked the man, &ldquo;Is it true, monk, that you are discontent, as they say?&rdquo; And he replied, &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Then he said: &ldquo;O monk, why are you discontent from a dispensation such as ours, that leads to safety, and all for fleshly sensual desires? Wise men of old, who were kings in Surundha, a city prosperous and measuring twelve leagues either way, though for seven hundred years they lived in one chamber with a woman beauteous as the Devaccharās, yet did not yield to their senses, and never so much as looked at her with desire.&rdquo; So saying, he told a story of the past.</span><span class="t18"> [4.67]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when king Kāsi was reigning over the realm of Kāsi, in Surundha his city, neither son nor daughter had he. So he bade his queens offer prayer for sons. Then the Bodhisatta, passing out of the Brahmā Realm, was conceived in the womb of his chief queen. And because by his birth he cheered the hearts of a great multitude, he received the name of Udayabhadda, or Welcome. At the time when the lad could walk upon his feet, another being came into this world from the Brahmā Realm, and became a girl child in the womb of another of this king&rsquo;s wives, and she was named with the same name, Udayabhaddā.</p>
<p class="p7">When the prince came of years, he attained a mastery in all branches of education; <span class="t18">{4.105}</span><a id="a10479"></a> more, he was chaste to a degree, and knew nothing of the deeds of the flesh, not even in dream, nor was his heart bent on sinfulness. The king desired<a id="a10480"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15899"><span class="t9">{790}</span></a> to make his son king, with the solemn sprinkling, and to arrange plays for his pleasure; and gave command accordingly. But the Bodhisatta replied, &ldquo;I do not want the kingdom, and my heart is not bent on sinfulness.&rdquo; Again and again he was entreated, but his reply was to have made a woman&rsquo;s image of red gold, which he sent to his parents, with the message, &ldquo;When I find such a woman as this, I will accept the kingdom.&rdquo; This golden image they dispatched over all Jambudīpa, but found no woman like to it. Then they decked out Udayabhaddā very fine, and confronted her with the image; and her beauty surpassed it as she stood. Then they wedded her to the Bodhisatta for consort, against their wills though it were, his own sister the princess Udayabhaddā, born of a different mother, and sprinkled him to be king.</p>
<p class="p7">These two lived together a life of chastity. In course of time, when his parents were dead, the Bodhisatta ruled the realm. The two dwelt together in one chamber, yet denied their senses, and never so much as looked upon one another in the way of desire; nay, a promise they even made, that which of them soever should first die, he should return to the other from his place of new birth, and say, &ldquo;In such a place am I born again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10481"></a>Now from the time of his sprinkling the Bodhisatta lived seven hundred years, and then he died. There was no other king, the commands of Udayabhaddā were promulgated, the courtiers administered the kingdom. The Bodhisatta had become Sakka in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, and by the magnificence of his glory was for seven days unable to remember the past. So he, after the course of seven hundred years, according to man&rsquo;s reckoning,<a id="a10482"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15901"><span class="t9">{791}</span></a> remembered, and said to himself, &ldquo;To the king&rsquo;s daughter Udayabhaddā I will go, and I will test her with <span class="t18">[4.68] </span>riches, and roaring with the roar of a lion I will discourse, and will fulfil my promise!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">In that age they say that the length of man&rsquo;s life was ten thousand years. Now at that time, it being the time of night, the palace doors were fast closed, and the guard set, and the king&rsquo;s daughter was sitting quiet and alone, in a magnificent chamber upon the fine terrace of her seven-storeyed mansion, <span class="t18">{4.106}</span> meditating upon her own virtue. Then Sakka took a golden dish filled with coins all of gold, and in her very sleeping-chamber appeared before her; and standing on one side, began speech with her by reciting the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;You flawless in your beauty, pure and bright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You sitting lonely on this terrace-height,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In pose most graceful, eyed like nymphs of heaven,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I pray you, let me spend with you this night!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this the princess made answer in the two verses following:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;To this battlemented city, dug with moats, approach is hard,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">While its trenches and its towers hand and sword unite to guard.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Not the young and not the mighty entrance here can lightly gain;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell me &ndash; what can be the reason why to meet me you are fain?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka recited the fourth verse: <span class="t18">{4.107}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;I, fair beauty, am a Yakkha, I that now appear to you:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Grant to me your favour, lady, this full bowl receive from me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing which the princess replied by repeating the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;I ask for none, since Udaya has died,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor god nor Yakkha, no nor man, beside:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Therefore, O mighty Yakkha, get you gone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come no more hither, but far off abide.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing her lion&rsquo;s note, he stood not, but made as though to depart; and at once disappeared. Next day at the same hour, he took a silver bowl filled with golden coins and addressed her by repeating the sixth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;That chief joy, to lovers known completely,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which makes men do full many an evil thing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Despise not you, O lady, smiling sweetly:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">See, a full bowl of silver here I bring!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the princess began to think, &ldquo;If I allow him to talk and prate, he will come again and again. I will have nothing to say to him now.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.108}</span> So she said nothing at all. Sakka finding that she had nothing to say, disappeared at once from his place.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day, at the same time, he took an iron bowl full of coins, and said: &ldquo;Lady, if you will bless me with your love, I will give this iron bowl full of coins to you.&rdquo; When she saw him, the princess repeated the seventh verse: <span class="t18">[4.69]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Men that would woo a woman, raise and raise</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The bids of gold, till she their will obeys.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The gods&rsquo; ways differ, as I judge by you:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You comest now with less than other days.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being, when he heard these words, made reply, &ldquo;Lady princess, I am a wary trader, and I waste not my substance for nought. If you were increasing in youth or beauty, I would also increase the present I offer you; but you are fading, and so I make the offering dwindle also.&rdquo; So saying, he repeated three verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;O woman! Youthful bloom and beauty fade</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Within this world of men, you fair-limbed maid.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And you today are older grown than erst,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So dwindles less the sum I would have paid.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Thus, glorious daughter of a king, before my gazing eyes</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As goes the flight of day and night your beauty fades and dies.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. But if, O daughter of a king most wise, it pleases you</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Holy and pure to aye endure, more lovely shall you be!&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.109}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hereupon the princess repeated another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;The gods are not like men, they grow not old;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Upon their flesh is seen no wrinkled fold.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How is&rsquo;t the gods have no corporeal frame?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This, mighty Yakkha, I would now be told!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka explained the matter by repeating another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;The gods are not like men: they grow not old;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Upon their flesh is seen no wrinkled fold:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tomorrow and tomorrow ever more</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Celestial beauty grows, and bliss untold.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.110}</span></p>
<p class="p6">When she heard the beauty of the world of gods, she asked the way to go there in another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;What terrifies so many mortals here?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I ask you, mighty Yakkha, to make clear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That path, in such diversity explained:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How faring heavenwards need no one fear?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Sakka explained the matter in another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;Who keeps in due control both voice and mind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who with the body loves not wrong to do,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Within whose house much food and drink we find,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Large-handed, bounteous, in all faith all true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of favours free, soft-tongued, of kindly cheer &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He that so walks to heaven need nothing fear.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.111}</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the princess had heard his words, she rendered thanks in another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;Like a mother, like a father, Yakkha, you admonish me:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mighty one, O beauteous being, tell me, tell me who you be?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.70]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta repeated another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;I am Udaya, fair lady, for my promise come to you:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now I go, for I have spoken; from the promise I am free.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The princess drew a deep breath, and said: &ldquo;You are king Udayabhadda, my lord!&rdquo; then burst into a flood of tears, and added, &ldquo;Without you I cannot live! Instruct me, that I may live with you always!&rdquo; So saying she repeated another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re Udaya, come hither for your promise &ndash; truly he &ndash;,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then instruct me, that together we, O prince, again may be!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then he repeated four verses by way of instruction:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. &ldquo;Youth passes soon: a moment &ndash; &rsquo;tis gone by;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No standing-place is firm: all creatures die</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To new life born: this fragile frame decays:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then be not careless, walk in piety.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. If the whole earth with all her wealth could be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The realm of one sole king to hold in fee,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A holy saint would leave him in the race:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then be not careless, walk in piety.</span><span class="t18"> {4.112}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. Mother and father, brother-kin, and she</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">(The wife) who with a price can purchased be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They go, and each the other leave behind:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then be not careless, walk in piety.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. Remember that this body food shall be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For others; joy alike and misery,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A passing hour, as life succeeds to life:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then be not careless, walk in piety.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">In this manner discoursed the Great Being. The lady being pleased with the discoursing, rendered thanks in the words of the last verse: <span class="t18">{4.113}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;Sweet the saying of this Yakkha: brief the life that mortals know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sad it is, and short, and with it comes inseparable woe.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I renounce the world: from Kāsi, from Surundhana, I go.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Having thus discoursed to her, the Bodhisatta went back to his own place.</p>
<p class="p7">The next day the princess entrusted her courtiers with the government; and in that very city of hers, in a delightful park, she became a recluse. There she lived righteously, until at the end of her days she was born again in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, as the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s handmaiden.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, now at the conclusion of the Truths, the discontented monk was established in the fruit of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time Rāhula&rsquo;s mother was the princess, and Sakka was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a10492"></a><a id="a10493"></a><span class="t30">At one time, we learn, five hundred citizens of Sāvatthi, being householders and friends of the Tathāgata, had heard the Dhamma and had renounced the world, and been ordained as monastics. Living in the house of the Golden Pavement, at midnight they indulged in thoughts of wrong. (All the details are to be understood as in a previous story.)</span><a id="a10494"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15903"><span class="t9">{792}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10495"></a><a id="a10496"></a><span class="t34">The Teacher regards his disciples three times a night and three times a day, six times every night and day, as a jay guards her egg, or a yak-cow her tail, or a mother her beloved son, or a one-eyed man his remaining eye; so in the very instant he overcame wrong which was beginning. He was observing Jetavana on that midnight and knowing the monks&rsquo; conduct and their thoughts, he considered, &ldquo;This wrong among these monks if it grows will destroy the foundation for becoming an Arahat. I will this moment repudiate this wrong and show them how to become Arahats,&rdquo; so leaving the perfumed chamber he called Ānanda, and bidding him collect all the monks dwelling in the place, he got them together and sat down on the seat prepared for Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At the command of the Fortunate One, the Saṅgha was assembled by the venerable Ānanda. The Teacher sat in the appointed seat, and without asking them, &ldquo;Do you indulge in thoughts of wrongdoing?&rdquo; he addressed them comprehensively and in general terms, &ldquo;Monks, there is no such thing as a petty wrong. A monk must check all defilements as they each arise. Wise men of old, before the Buddha came, subdued their defilements and attained to the knowledge of a Paccekabuddha.&rdquo; With these words, he told there a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{4.114}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10497"></a><a id="a10498"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, there were two friends in a certain village in the kingdom of Kāsi. These had gone afield, taking with them vessels for drinking, which they laid out of the way as they broke the clods, and when they were thirsty, went and drank water out of them. One of them, on going for a drink, conserved the water in his own pot, and drank out of the pot of the other. In the evening, when he came out from the woodland, and had bathed, he stood thinking. &ldquo;Have I done any wrong today,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;either by the door of the body, or any other?&rdquo;<a id="a10499"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15905"><span class="t9">{793}</span></a><a id="a10500"></a> Then he remembered how he drank the stolen water, and grief came upon him, and he cried, &ldquo;If this thirst grows upon me, it will bring me to some evil birth! I will subdue my wrongs.&rdquo; So with this stolen draught of water for cause,<a id="a10501"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15907"><span class="t9">{794}</span></a> he gradually acquired supernatural insight, and attained the knowledge of a Paccekabuddha; and there he stood, reflecting upon the knowledge which he had attained.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10502"></a>Now the other man, having bathed, got up, saying: &ldquo;Come, friend, let us go home.&rdquo; Said the other, &ldquo;Go home you, home is nothing to me, I am a Paccekabuddha.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pooh! Are Paccekabuddhas like you?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are they like, then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hair two fingers long, they wear yellow robes, they live in Nandamūla cave high up in the Himālayas.&rdquo; The other stroked his head, and in that very moment the marks of a layman disappeared, <span class="t18">[4.72] </span>a pair of red cloths were wrapped round him, a waist-band yellow like a flash of lightning was tied about him, the upper robe of the colour of red lac was thrown over one shoulder, a dust-heap ragged cloth dingy as a storm-cloud lay on his shoulder, a bee-brown earthen bowl dangled from over his left shoulder; there he stood poised in mid-air, and having delivered a discourse, he rose and did not descend until he came to the mountain cave of Nandamūla.</p>
<p class="p7">Another man, who also lived in a village of Kāsi, a landowner, was sitting in the bazaar, when he saw a man approach leading his wife. Seeing her (and she was a woman of surpassing beauty) he broke the moral principles, and looked upon her; then again he thought: &ldquo;This desire, if it increases, will cast me into some evil birth.&rdquo; Being exercised in mind, he developed supernatural insight, and attained the knowledge of a Paccekabuddha; then poised in the air, he delivered a discourse, <span class="t18">{4.115}</span><a id="a10503"></a> and he also went to the Nandamūla cave.<a id="a10504"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15909"><span class="t9">{795}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">Villagers of a place in Kāsi were likewise two, a father and a son, who were going on a journey together. At the entering in of a forest robbers were posted. These robbers, if they took a father and son together, would keep the son with them, and send the father away, saying: &ldquo;Bring back a ransom for your son,&rdquo; or if two brothers, they kept the younger and sent the elder away; or if teacher and pupil, they kept the teacher and sent the pupil &ndash; and the pupil for love of learning would bring money and release his teacher. Now when this father and son saw the robbers lying in wait, the father said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call me &lsquo;father,&rsquo; and I will not call you &lsquo;son.&rsquo; &rdquo; And so they agreed. So when the robbers came up, and asked how they stood to one another, they replied, &ldquo;We are nothing to one another,&rdquo; thus telling a premeditated lie. When they came out of the forest, and were resting after the evening bath, the son examined his own virtue, and remembering this lie, he thought: &ldquo;This wrong, if it increases, will plunge me in some evil birth. I will subdue my wrongdoing!&rdquo; Then he developed supernatural insight, and attained to the knowledge of a Paccekabuddha, and poised in the air delivered a discourse to his father, and he too went to the Nandamūla cave.</p>
<p class="p7">In a village of Kāsi also lived a village headman, who laid an interdict upon all slaughter. Now when the time came when offering was wont to be made to the spirits, a great crowd gathered, and said: &ldquo;My lord! This is the time for sacrifice: let us slay deer and swine and other animals, and make offering to the Yakkhas,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Do as you have done previously.&rdquo; The people made a great slaughter. The man seeing a great quantity of fish and flesh, thought to himself, &ldquo;All these living creatures the men have slain, and all because of my word alone!&rdquo; He repented: and as he stood <span class="t18">[4.73] </span>by the window, he developed supernatural insight, and attained to the knowledge of a Paccekabuddha, and poised in the air delivered a discourse, then he too went to the Nandamūla cave.</p>
<p class="p7">Another village headman who lived in the kingdom of Kāsi, prohibited the sale of strong drink. A crowd of people cried out to him, &ldquo;My lord, what shall we do? It is the time-honoured drinking festival!&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Do as you have always done previously.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.116}</span> The people made their festival, and drank strong drink, and fell quarrelling; there were broken legs and arms, and cracked crowns, and ears torn off, and many a penalty was inflicted for it. The village headman seeing this, thought to himself, &ldquo;If I had not permitted this, they would not have suffered this misery.&rdquo; Even for this trifle he felt remorse: then he developed supernatural insight, and attained the knowledge of a Paccekabuddha, poised in the air he discoursed, and bade them be vigilant, then he too went to the Nandamūla cave.</p>
<p class="p7">Some time afterwards, the five Paccekabuddhas all alighted at the gate of Benares, seeking for alms. Their upper robe and lower robe neatly arranged, with gracious address they went on their rounds, and came to the gate of the king&rsquo;s palace. The king was much pleased to behold them; he invited them into his palace, and washed their feet, anointed them with fragrant oil, set before them savoury food both hard and soft, and sitting on one side, thus addressed them, &ldquo;Sirs, that you in your youth have embraced the ascetic life, is beautiful; at this age, you have become ascetics, and you see the misery of evil sensual desires. What was the cause of your action?&rdquo; They replied as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;The water-draught of my own friend, although a friend, I stole:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10505"></a><span class="t12">Loathing the wrong which I had done, I afterwards was fain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10506"></a><span class="t12">To leave the world, an eremite, lest I do wrong again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;I looked upon another&rsquo;s wife; lust rose within my soul:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10507"></a><span class="t12">Loathing the wrong which I had done, I afterwards was fain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10508"></a><span class="t12">To leave the world, an eremite, lest I do wrong again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Thieves caught my father in a wood: to whom I did forth tell</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That he was other than he was &ndash; a lie, I knew it well:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Loathing the wrong which I had done, I afterwards was fain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To leave the world, an eremite, lest I do wrong again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;The people at a drinking-feast full many beasts did kill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And not against my will:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Loathing the wrong which I had done, I afterwards was fain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To leave the world, an eremite, lest I do wrong again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Those persons who in former times of liquors drank their fill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now carried out a drinking-bout, whence many suffered ill, </span><span class="t18">{4.117}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And not against my will:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Loathing the wrong which I had done, I afterwards was fain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To leave the world, an eremite, lest I do wrong again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">These five verses they repeated one after the other.</p>
<p class="p7">When the king had heard the explanation of each, he uttered his praise, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, your asceticism becomes you well.&rdquo; <span class="t18">[4.74]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10509"></a>The king was delighted at the discourse of these men. He bestowed upon them cloth for outer and inner garments, and medicines, then let the Paccekabuddhas go away. They thanked him, and returned to the place whence they came. Ever after that the king loathed the pleasures of sense, was free from desire, ate<a id="a10510"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15911"><span class="t9">{796}</span></a> his choice and dainty food, but to women he would not speak, would not look at them, rose up disgusted at heart and retired to his magnificent chamber, and there he sat: stared at a white wall until focusing on the Meditation Object, he attained Absorption. In this rapture rapt, he recited a verse in dispraise of desire:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Come, out on lust, I say, unsavoury, thorn-beset!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Never, though long I followed wrong, such joy as this I met!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.118}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then his chief queen thought to herself, &ldquo;That king heard the discoursing of the Paccekabuddhas, and now he never speaks to us, but buries himself despondent in his magnificent chamber. I must take him in hand.&rdquo; So she came to the door of that lordly chamber, and standing at the door, heard the king&rsquo;s exalted utterances, in dispraise of desire. She said: &ldquo;O mighty king, you speak ill of desire! But there is no joy like the joy of sweet desire!&rdquo; Then in praise of desire she repeated another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Great is the joy of sweet desire: no greater joy than love:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who follow this attain the bliss of paradise above!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, the king made reply, &ldquo;Perish, vile jade! What say you? Whence comes the joy of desire? There are miseries which come to pay for it,&rdquo; with which he uttered the remaining verses in dispraise:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Ill-tasting, painful is desire, there is no worser woe:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who follow wrong are sure to win the pains of hell below.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Than sword well whetted, or a blade implacable, athirst,</span></p>

<p class="p6">Thus the Great Being discoursed to his consort.

Then along the path of the wind he past to the furthest Himālayas, and in a delightful spot built a <span class="t18">[4.75] </span>hermitage; there he lived the life of a sage, until at the end of his days he became destined for the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended this discourse, added, &ldquo;Monks, there is no such thing as a petty wrong: the very smallest wrong must be checked by a wise man.&rdquo; Then he declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka; now at the conclusion of the Truths the five hundred monks became Arahats. &ldquo;At that time the Paccekabuddhas attained Nibbāna, Rāhula&rsquo;s mother was the queen consort, and I myself was the king.&rdquo;</span></p>

Yet all this magnificence he renounced when he perceived the bane that lies in desires. At midnight, with Channa in company, he mounted his horse Kanthaka, and departed: on the banks of Anomā, the River Glorious, he renounced the world, and for six years he tormented himself with austerities, and then attained to perfect wisdom.&rdquo; Thus they talked of the Buddha&rsquo;s virtues. The Teacher entering, asked, &ldquo;What are you speaking of now, monks, as you sit here?&rdquo; They told him. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that the Tathāgata has made the Great Renunciation. In days of yore he retired and gave up the kingdom of Benares City, which was twelve leagues in extent.&rdquo; So saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10530"></a><a id="a10531"></a><a id="a10532"></a>In the past a king named Sabbadatta reigned in the city of Ramma. The place which we now call Benares is named Surundhana City in the Udayajātaka [Ja 458], and Sudassana in the Cullasutasomajātaka [Ja 525],<span class="t9"> </span>and <span class="t18">[4.76]</span><a id="a10534"></a> Brahmavaddhana in the Sonanadajātaka [Ja 532],<span class="t9"> </span><a id="a10536"></a>and Pupphavatī in the Khaṇḍahālajātaka [Ja 542]: <span class="t18">{4.120}</span><a id="a10537"></a> but in this Yuvañjayajātaka [Ja 460] it is named Ramma City. In this manner its name changes on each several occasion. At that time the king Sabbadatta had a thousand sons; and to his eldest son Yuvañjana he gave the viceroyalty.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10538"></a>One day early in the morning he mounted his splendid chariot, and in great pomp went to sport in the park. On the tree-tops, on the grass-tips, at the ends of the branches, on all the spiders&rsquo; webs and threads, on the points of the rushes, he saw the dew-drops hanging like so many strings of pearls. &ldquo;Friend charioteer,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what is this?&rdquo; &ldquo;This, my lord,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;is what falls in the cold weather, and they call it dew.&rdquo; The prince took his pleasure in the park for a portion of the day. In the evening, as he was returning home, he could see none of it. &ldquo;Friend charioteer,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;where are the dew-drops? I do not see them now.&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;as the sun rises higher, they all melt and sink into the ground.&rdquo; On hearing this, the prince was distressed, and said: &ldquo;The life of us living beings is fashioned like dew-drops on the grass. I must be rid of the oppression of disease, old age, and death; I must take leave of my parents, and renounce the world.&rdquo; So because of the dew-drops, he perceived the Three Worlds<a id="a10539"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15921"><span class="t9">{801}</span></a> as it were in a blazing fire. When he came home, he went into the presence of his father in his magnificent Hall of Judgement, and greeting his father, he stood on one side, and repeated the first verse, asking his leave to renounce the world:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;I greet the lord of charioteers with friends and courtiers by:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The world, O king! I would renounce: let not my lord deny.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the king repeated the second verse, dissuading him:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;If aught you crave, Yuvañjana, I will fulfil it quite:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If any hurt you, I protect: be you no eremite.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.121}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, the prince recited the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;No man there is that does me harm, my wishes nothing lack;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But I would seek a refuge, where old age makes no attack.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">By way of explaining this matter, the Teacher uttered a half-verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4a. &ldquo;The son speaks to his father thus, the father to his son,&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The remaining half-verse was uttered by the king:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4b. &ldquo;Leave not the world, O prince! So cry the townsfolk every one.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.77]</span></p>
<p class="p6">The prince again repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;O do not from the unworldly life, great monarch, make me stay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lest I, intoxicate with sensual desires, to age become a prey!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">This said, the king hesitated. Then the mother was told, &ldquo;Your son, my lady, is asking his father&rsquo;s leave to renounce the world.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; she asked. It took her breath away. Seated in her litter of gold she went swiftly to the Hall of Judgement, and repeating the sixth verse, asked:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;I beg you, it is I, my dear, and I would make you stay!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Long wish I you, my son, to see, O do not go away!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.122}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing which the prince repeated the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Like as the dew upon the grass, when the sun rises hot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So is the life of mortal men, O mother, stay me not!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When he had said this, she begged him again and again to the same effect. Then the Great Being addressed his father in the eighth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Let those that bear this litter, lift, let not my mother stay</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10540"></a><span class="t12">Me, mighty king! From entering upon my holy way.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10541"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15923"><span class="t19">{802}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">When the king heard his son&rsquo;s words, he said: &ldquo;Go, lady, in your litter, back to our palace of Perennial Delight.&rdquo; At his words her feet failed her: and surrounded with her company of women, she departed, and entered the palace, and stood looking towards the Hall of Judgement, and wondering what news of her son. After his mother&rsquo;s departure the Bodhisatta again asked leave of his father. The king could not refuse him, and said: &ldquo;Have your will, then, dear son, and renounce the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">When this consent was gained, the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s youngest brother, prince Yudhiṭṭhila, greeted his father, and likewise asked leave to follow the ascetic life, and the king consented. Both brothers bade their father farewell, and having now renounced worldly sensual desires departed from the Hall of Judgement, amidst a great company of people. The queen looking upon the Great Being cried weeping, &ldquo;My son has renounced the world, and the city of Ramma will be empty!&rdquo; Then she repeated a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;Make haste, and bless you! Empty now is Rammaka, I know;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">King Sabbadatta has allowed Yuvañjana to go. </span><span class="t18">{4.123}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. The eldest of a thousand, he, like gold to look upon,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This mighty prince has left the world the yellow robe to don.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta did not at once embrace the ascetic life. No, he first bade farewell to his parents; then taking with him his youngest brother, prince Yudhiṭṭhila, he left the city, and sending back the great <span class="t18">[4.78] </span>multitude which followed them, they both made their way to the Himālayas. There in a delightful spot they built a hermitage, and embraced the life of a holy sage, and cultivating the transcendent rapture of meditation, they lived all their lives long upon the fruits and roots of the forest, and became destined for the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7">This matter is explained in the verse spoken after Fully Awakening which comes last:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;Yuvañjana, Yudhiṭṭhila, in holy life remain:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their father and their mother left, they break in two death&rsquo;s chain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that the Tathāgata renounced a kingdom to follow the ascetic life, but it was the same before,&rdquo; then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time members of the present king&rsquo;s family were the father and mother, Ānanda was Yudhiṭṭhila, and I was Yuvañjana myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Let Lakkhaṇa.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told in Jetavana about a landowner whose father was dead. This man on his father&rsquo;s death was overwhelmed with sorrow: leaving all his duties undone, he gave himself up to his sorrow wholly. The Teacher at dawn of day looking out upon mankind, perceived that he was ripe for attaining the fruit of the First Path. Next day, after going his rounds for alms in Sāvatthi, his meal done, he dismissed the monks, and taking with him a junior monk, </span><span class="t18">{4.124}</span><a id="a10552"></a><span class="t30"> went to this man&rsquo;s house, and gave him greeting, and addressed him as he sat there in words of honey sweetness. &ldquo;You are in sorrow, lay brother?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Yes, sir, afflicted with sorrow for my father&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Lay brother, wise men of old who exactly knew the eight conditions of this world,</span><a id="a10553"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15927"><span class="t9">{804}</span></a><span class="t30"> felt at a father&rsquo;s death no grief, not even a little.&rdquo; Then at his request he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, at Benares, a great king named Dasaratha renounced the ways of evil, and reigned in righteousness. Of his sixteen thousand wives, the eldest and queen-consort bore him two sons and a daughter; <span class="t18">[4.79] </span><a id="a10554"></a>the elder son was named Rāmapaṇḍita, or Rāma the Wise, the second was named prince Lakkhaṇa [Lucky], and the daughter&rsquo;s name was the lady Sītā [Furrow].<a id="a10555"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15929"><span class="t9">{805}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">In course of time, the queen-consort died. At her death the king was for a long time crushed by sorrow, but urged by his courtiers he performed her obsequies, and set another in her place as queen-consort. She was dear to the king and beloved. In time she also conceived, and all due attention having been given her, she brought forth a son, and they named him prince Bharata.</p>
<p class="p7">The king loved his son much, and said to the queen, &ldquo;Lady, I offer you a boon: choose.&rdquo; She accepted the offer, but put it off for the time. When the lad was seven years old, she went to the king, and said to him, &ldquo;My lord, you promised a boon for my son. Will you give it me now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Choose, lady,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;give my son the kingdom.&rdquo; The king snapped his fingers at her, &ldquo;Out, vile jade!&rdquo; said he angrily, &ldquo;my other two sons shine like blazing fires; would you kill them, and ask the kingdom for a son of yours?&rdquo; She fled in terror to her magnificent chamber, but on other days again and again asked the king for this.</p>
<p class="p7">The king would not give her this gift. He thought within himself, &ldquo;Women are ungrateful and treacherous. This woman might use a forged letter or a treacherous bribe to get my sons murdered.&rdquo; So he sent for his sons, and told them all about it, saying: &ldquo;My sons, if you live here some mischief may befall you. Go to some neighbouring kingdom, or to the woodland, and when my body is burnt, then return and inherit the kingdom which belongs to your family.&rdquo; Then he summoned soothsayers, and asked them the limits of his own life. They told him he would live yet twelve years longer. <span class="t18">{4.125}</span> Then he said: &ldquo;Now, my sons, after twelve years you must return, and uplift the umbrella of royalty.&rdquo; They promised, and after taking leave of their father, went forth from the palace weeping. The lady Sītā said: &ldquo;I too will go with my brothers,&rdquo; she bade her father farewell, and went forth weeping.</p>
<p class="p7">These three departed amidst a great company of people. They sent the people back, and proceeded until at last they came to the Himālayas. There in a spot well-watered, and convenient for the getting of wild fruits, they built a hermitage, and there lived, feeding upon the wild fruits.</p>
<p class="p7">Lakkhaṇapaṇḍita and Sītā said to Rāmapaṇḍita, &ldquo;You are in place of a father to us; remain then in the hut, and we will bring wild fruit, and feed you.&rdquo; He agreed and thenceforward Rāmapaṇḍita stayed where he was, the others brought the wild fruit and fed him with it. <span class="t18">[4.80]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10556"></a>Thus they lived there, feeding upon the wild fruit; but king Dasaratha pined after his sons, and died in the ninth year. When his obsequies were performed, the queen gave orders that the umbrella should be raised over her son, prince Bharata. But the courtiers said: &ldquo;The lords of the umbrella are dwelling in the forest,&rdquo; and they would not allow it. Said prince Bharata, &ldquo;I will fetch back my brother Rāmapaṇḍita from the forest, and raise the royal umbrella over him.&rdquo; Taking the five emblems of royalty,<a id="a10557"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15931"><span class="t9">{806}</span></a><a id="a10558"></a> he proceeded with a complete host of the four arms<a id="a10559"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15933"><span class="t9">{807}</span></a> to their dwelling-place.</p>
<p class="p7">Not far away he caused camp to be pitched, and then with a few courtiers he visited the hermitage, at the time when Lakkhaṇapaṇḍita and Sītā were away in the woods. At the door of the hermitage sat Rāmapaṇḍita, undismayed and at ease, like a figure of fine gold firmly set. The prince approached him with a greeting, and standing on one side, told him of all that had happened in the kingdom, and falling at his feet along with the courtiers, burst into weeping. Rāmapaṇḍita neither sorrowed nor wept; emotion in his mind was none.</p>
<p class="p7">When Bharata had finished weeping, and sat down, towards evening the other two returned with wild fruits. Rāmapaṇḍita thought: &ldquo;These two are young: all-comprehending wisdom like mine is not theirs. <span class="t18">{4.126}</span> If they are told on a sudden that our father is dead, the pain will be greater than they can bear, and who knows but their hearts may break. I will persuade them to go down into the water, and find a means of disclosing the truth.&rdquo; Then pointing out to them a place in front where there was water, he said: &ldquo;You have been out too long, let this be your penance &ndash; go into that water, and stand there.&rdquo; Then he repeated a half-verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1a. &ldquo;Let Lakkhaṇa and Sītā both into that pond descend.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">One word sufficed, into the water they went, and stood there. Then he told them the news by repeating the other half-verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1b. &ldquo;Bharata says, king Dasaratha&rsquo;s life is at an end.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When they heard the news of their father&rsquo;s death, they fainted. Again he repeated it, again they fainted, and when even a third time they fainted away, the courtiers raised them and brought them out of the water, and set them upon dry ground. When they had been comforted, they all sat weeping and wailing together. Then prince Bharata thought: &ldquo;My brother prince Lakkhaṇa, and my sister the lady Sītā, cannot restrain their grief to hear of our father&rsquo;s death; but Rāmapaṇḍita neither wails nor weeps. I wonder what can the reason be that he <span class="t18">[4.81] </span>grieves not? I will ask.&rdquo; Then he repeated the second verse, asking the question:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Say by what power you grievest not, Rāma, when grief should be?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though it is said your sire is dead grief overwhelms not thee!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Rāmapaṇḍita explained the reason of his feeling no grief by saying,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;When man can never keep a thing, though loudly he may cry,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why should a wise intelligence torment itself thereby? </span><span class="t18">{4.127}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. The young in years, the older grown, the fool, and yes, the wise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For rich, for poor one end is sure: each man among them dies.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. As sure as for the ripened fruit there comes the fear of fall,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So surely comes the fear of death to mortals one and all.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Who in the morning light are seen by evening oft are gone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And seen at evening time, is gone by morning many a one.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. If to a fool infatuate a blessing could accrue</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When he torments himself with tears, the wise this same would do.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. By this tormenting of himself he waxes thin and pale;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This cannot bring the dead to life, and nothing tears avail.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Even as a blazing house may be put out with water, so</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The strong, the wise, the intelligent, who well the scriptures know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Scatter their grief like cotton when the stormy winds do blow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. One mortal dies &ndash; to kindred ties born is another straight:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Each creature&rsquo;s bliss dependent is on ties associate.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. The strong man therefore, skilled in sacred text,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Keen-contemplating this world and the next,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Knowing their nature, not by any grief,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">However great, in mind and heart is vexed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="p6">In these verses he explained the impermanence of things.<span class="t18"> {4.129}</span></p>
<p class="p7">When the company heard this discourse of Rāmapaṇḍita, illustrating the teaching of Impermanence, they lost all their grief. Then prince Bharata saluted Rāmapaṇḍita, begging him to receive the kingdom of Benares. &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Rāma, &ldquo;take Lakkhaṇa and Sītā with you, and administer the kingdom yourselves.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, my lord, you take it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Brother, my father commanded me to receive the kingdom at the end of twelve years. If I go now, I shall not carry out his bidding. After three more years I will come.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who will carry on the government all that time?&rdquo; &ldquo;You do it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then until I come, these slippers shall do it,&rdquo; said Rāma, and doffing his slippers of straw he gave them to his brother. So these three persons took the slippers, and bidding the wise man farewell, went to Benares with their great crowd of followers. <span class="t18">[4.82]</span></p>
<p class="p7">For three years the slippers ruled the kingdom. The courtiers placed these straw slippers upon the royal throne, when they judged a cause. If the cause were decided wrongly, <span class="t18">{4.130}</span><a id="a10562"></a> the slippers beat upon each other,<a id="a10563"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15937"><span class="t9">{809}</span></a> and at that sign it was examined again; when the decision was right, the slippers lay quiet.</p>
<p class="p7">When the three years were over, the wise man came out of the forest, and came to Benares, and entered the park. The princes hearing of his arrival proceeded with a great company to the park, and making Sītā the queen consort, gave to them both the ceremonial sprinkling. The sprinkling thus performed, the Great Being standing in a magnificent chariot, and surrounded by a vast company, entered the city, making a solemn circuit right-wise; then mounting to the great terrace of his splendid palace Sucandaka, he reigned there in righteousness for sixteen thousand years, and then went to swell the hosts of heaven.</p>
<p class="p7">This verse spoken after Fully Awakening explains the upshot:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;Years sixty times a hundred, and ten thousand more, all told,</span></p>
