<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one layman, wrapped up in contemplation of the Buddha, walks across the waves of a river. The Buddha tells a story in which two people were stranded on an island, but because of the virtue of one of them he was rescued by a Devatā. He only agreed to be saved if he could share merit with his companion, and he too could come.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a4140"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the Sea Devatā (Samuddadevatā),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Behold the fruit of sacrifice.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{2.111}</span><a id="a4142"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying in Jetavana, about a believing layman. This was a faithful, pious soul, an elect disciple. One evening, on his way to Jetavana, he came to the bank of the river Aciravatī, when the ferrymen had pulled up their boat on the shore in order to attend service; as no boat could be seen at the landing-stage, and our friend&rsquo;s mind being full of delightful thoughts of the Buddha, he walked into the river.</span><a id="a4143"></a><a href="notes.html#a15103"><span class="t9">{419}</span></a><span class="t30"> His feet did not sink below the water. He got as far as mid-river walking as though he were on dry land; but there he noticed the waves. Then his Absorption subsided, and his feet began to sink. Again he strung himself up to high tension, and walked on over the water. So he arrived at Jetavana, greeted the Teacher, and took a seat on one side. The Teacher entered into conversation with him pleasantly. &ldquo;I hope, good layman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you had no mishap on your way.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;on my way I was so absorbed in thoughts of the Buddha that I set foot upon the river; but I walked over it as though it had been dry ground!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, friend layman,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;you are not the only one who has kept safe by remembering the virtues of the Buddha. In olden days pious laymen have been shipwrecked in mid-ocean, and saved themselves by remembering the Buddha&rsquo;s virtues.&rdquo; Then, at the man&rsquo;s request, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4144"></a>In the past, in the days when Kassapa was Supreme Buddha, a disciple, who had entered on the Paths, took passage on board ship in company with a barber of some considerable property. The barber&rsquo;s wife had given him in charge of our friend, to look after him for better and for worse.</p>
<p class="p7">A week later, the ship was wrecked in mid-ocean. These two persons <span class="t18">[2.78] </span><a id="a4145"></a>clinging to one plank were cast up on an island. There the barber killed some birds, and cooked them, offering a share of his meal to the lay brother. &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have had enough.&rdquo; He was thinking to himself, &ldquo;In this place there is no help for us except the Three Jewels,&rdquo;<a id="a4146"></a><a href="notes.html#a15105"><span class="t9">{420}</span></a> and so he pondered upon the blessings of the Three Jewels. As he pondered and pondered, a Nāga king who had been born in that isle changed his own body to the shape of a great ship. The ship was filled with the seven kinds of precious things. <span class="t18">{2.112}</span><a id="a4147"></a> A spirit of the sea was the helmsman. The three masts were made of sapphire, the anchor<a id="a4148"></a><a href="notes.html#a15107"><span class="t9">{421}</span></a> of gold, the ropes of silver, and the planks were golden.</p>
<p class="p7">The sea-spirit stood on board, crying, &ldquo;Any passengers for Jambudīpa?&rdquo; The lay brother said: &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s where we are bound for.&rdquo; &ldquo;In with you then &ndash; on board with you!&rdquo; He went aboard, and wanted to call his friend the barber. &ldquo;You may come,&rdquo; says the helmsman, &ldquo;but not he.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; &ldquo;He is not a man of holy life, that&rsquo;s why,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I brought this ship for you, not for him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well: the gifts I have given, the virtues I have practised, the powers I have developed &ndash; I give him the fruit of all of them!&rdquo; &ldquo;I thank you, master!&rdquo; said the barber. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the sea-spirit, &ldquo;I can take you aboard.&rdquo; So he conveyed them both overseas, and sailed upstream to Benares. There, by his power, he created a store of wealth for both of them, and spoke to them thus:</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Keep company with the wise and good. If this barber had not been in company with this pious layman, he would have perished in the midst of the deep.&rdquo; Then he uttered these verses in praise of good company:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4149"></a><a id="a4150"></a><span class="t12">1. Passa saddhāya sīlassa, cāgassa ca ayaṁ phalaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nāgo nāvāya vaṇṇena, saddhaṁ vahatupāsakaṁ.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4151"></a><a id="a4152"></a><a id="a4153"></a><a id="a4154"></a><a id="a4155"></a><a id="a4156"></a><span class="t4">Behold, this is the fruit of faith, virtue and liberality, a Nāga, in the shape of a ship, conveys the faithful layman.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4157"></a><a id="a4158"></a><a id="a4159"></a><span class="t12">2. Sabbhi-r-eva samāsetha, sabbhi kubbetha santhavaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4160"></a><a id="a4161"></a><span class="t12">Satañ-hi sannivāsena sotthiṁ gacchatĭ nhāpito ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4162"></a><a id="a4163"></a><a id="a4164"></a><span class="t4">Associate only with the wise, be intimate with the wise, through living together with the good the barber got to safety. </span><span class="t18">{2.113}</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus did the spirit of the sea hold forth, poised in mid-air. Finally he went to his own abode, taking the Nāga king along with him.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, after finishing this discourse, declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the pious layman entered on the Fruit of the Second Path, &ldquo;On that occasion the converted lay brother attained Nibbāna; Sāriputta was the Nāga king, and the sea-spirit was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

The circumstances will be explained in the Eighth Book, in the Indriyajātaka [Ja 423].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning temptation by the wife of one&rsquo;s former days. The story is that a young man of good family at Sāvatthi heard the Teacher&rsquo;s preaching, and thinking it impossible to lead a holy life, perfectly complete and pure, as a householder, he determined to become an ascetic in the dispensation which leads to safety and so make an end of misery. So he gave up his house and property to his wife and children, and asked the Teacher to ordain him. The Teacher did so. As he was the junior in his going about for alms with his teachers and instructors, and as the monks were many, he got no chair either in laymen&rsquo;s houses or in the refectory, but only a stool or a bench at the end of the novices, his food was tossed him hastily on a ladle, he got gruel made of broken lumps of rice, solid food stale or decaying, or sprouts dried and burnt; and this was not enough to keep him alive. He took what he had got to the wife he had left: she took his bowl, saluted him, emptied it and gave him instead well-cooked gruel and rice with sauce and curry.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4174"></a><span class="t34">The monk was captivated by the love of such flavours and could not leave his wife. She thought she would test his affection. One day she had a countryman cleansed with white clay and set down in her house with some others of his people whom she had sent for, and she gave them something to eat and drink. They sat eating and enjoying it. At the house-door she had some bullocks bound to wheels and a cart set ready. She herself sat in a back room cooking cakes. Her husband came and stood at the door. Seeing him, one old servant told his mistress that there was an elder at the door. &ldquo;Salute him and bid him pass on.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But though he did so repeatedly, he saw the monk remaining there and told his mistress. She came, and lifting up the curtain to see, she cried, &ldquo;This is the father of my sons.&rdquo; She came out and saluted him: taking his bowl and making him enter she gave him food: when he had eaten she saluted again and said: &ldquo;Sir, you are a saint now: we have been staying in this house all this time; but there can be no proper householder&rsquo;s life without a master, so we will take another house and go far into the country: be zealous in your good works, and forgive me if I am doing wrong.&rdquo; For a time her husband was as if his heart would break. Then he said: &ldquo;I cannot leave you, do not go, I will come back to my worldly life; send a layman&rsquo;s garment to such and such a place, I will give up my bowl and robes and come back to you.&rdquo; She agreed. The monk went to his monastery, and giving up his bowl and robes to his teachers and instructors he explained, in answer to their questions, that he could not leave his wife and was going back to worldly life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Against his will they took him to the Teacher and told him that he was discontent and wished to go back to worldly life. The Teacher said: &ldquo;Is this tale true?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is, Lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who causes you to fall back?&rdquo; &ldquo;My wife.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the Teacher said to this monk, &ldquo;That is a woman who does you harm. In former times, too, she put you to the blush before the king and his whole court, and gave you good reason to leave your home.&rdquo; And he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when king Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born of his chief queen. He came of age, and his father passed away; and then he became king and ruled in righteousness.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta had a family priest named Ruhaka, and this Ruhaka had an old brahmin woman to wife.</p>
<p class="p7">The king gave the brahmin a horse fitted with all its trappings, and he mounted the horse and went to wait upon the king. As he rode along on the back of his richly caparisoned steed, the people on this side and that were loud in its praise, &ldquo;See that fine horse!&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;what a beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">When he came home again, he went into his mansion and told his wife. <span class="t18">{2.114}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Goodwife,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our horse is passing fine! Right and left the people are all speaking in praise of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Now his wife was no better than she should be, and full of deceit; so she made reply to him thus.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Ah, husband, you do not know wherein lies the beauty of this horse. It is all in his fine trappings. Now if you would make yourself fine like the horse, put his trappings on yourself and go down into the street, prancing along horse-fashion.<a id="a4175"></a><a href="notes.html#a15109"><span class="t9">{422}</span></a> You will see the king, and he will praise you, and all the people will praise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">This fool of a brahmin listened to it all, but did not know what she purposed. So he believed her, and did as she had said. All that saw him laughed aloud, &ldquo;There goes a fine teacher!&rdquo; said they all. And the king cried shame on him. &ldquo;Why, my Teacher,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has your bile gone wrong? Are you crazy?&rdquo; At this the brahmin thought that he must have behaved amiss, and he was ashamed. So he was angry with his wife, and made haste home, saying to himself, &ldquo;The woman has shamed me <span class="t18">[2.80] </span>before the king and all his army: I will chastise her and turn her out of doors!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">But the crafty woman found out that he had come home in anger; she stole a march on him, and departed by a side door, and made her way to the palace, where she stayed four or five days. When the king heard of it, he sent for his family priest, and said to him,</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My Teacher, all womankind are full of faults; you ought to forgive this lady,&rdquo; and with intent to make him forgive he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4176"></a><a id="a4177"></a><a id="a4178"></a><a id="a4179"></a><span class="t12">1. Api Ruhaka chinnāpi, jiyā sandhīyate puna,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4180"></a><a id="a4181"></a><span class="t12">Sandhīyassu purāṇiyā, mā kodhassa vasaṁ gamī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4182"></a><span class="t4">Although broken, Ruhaka, the bow string can be reconnected, connect with the old bow string,</span><a id="a4183"></a><a href="notes.html#a15111"><span class="t9">{423}</span></a><span class="t4"> do not be controlled by anger. </span><span class="t18">{2.115}</span></p>
<p class="p23">Hearing this, Ruhaka uttered the second:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4184"></a><a id="a4185"></a><a id="a4186"></a><a id="a4187"></a><span class="t12">2. Vijjamānesu vākesu, vijjamānesu kārisu,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Aññaṁ jiyaṁ karissāmi, alañ-ñeva purāṇiyā ti!</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4188"></a><span class="t4">While there is fibre existing, while there are workmen existing, I will make another bow string, enough with the old bow string!</span></p>
<p class="p23">So saying, he sent her away, and took him another brahmin woman to wife.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, after finishing this discourse, declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the tempted monk was established in the fruit of the First Path, &ldquo;On that occasion the former wife was the same, Ruhaka was the tempted monk, and I was the king of Benares.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">There is no present day story. In the past an unlucky young man, after completing his studies, is given a very beautiful maiden to wife, but he scorns her, and the king takes her to wife instead. Later on the road the queen sees her former husband and despises him with a smile. The Bodhisatta explains why.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a4202"></a><span class="t11">Now a lad Piṅguttara living in Mithilā came to Taxila, and studied under a famous teacher, and soon completed his education; then after diligent study he proposed to take leave of his teacher and go. But in this teacher&rsquo;s family there was a custom, that if there should be a daughter ripe for marriage she should be given to the eldest pupil. This teacher had a daughter beautiful as a Devakaññā, so he said: &ldquo;My son, I will give you my daughter and you shall take her with you.&rdquo; Now this lad was unfortunate and unlucky, but the girl was very lucky. When he saw her he did not care for her; but though he said so, he agreed, not wishing to disregard his master&rsquo;s words, and the brahmin married the daughter to him. Night came, when he lay upon the prepared bed; no sooner had she got into the bed than up he got groaning and lay down upon the floor. She got out and lay beside him, then he got up and went to bed again; when she came into the bed again he got out &ndash; for ill luck cannot mate with good luck. So the girl stayed in bed and he stayed on the ground. Thus they spent seven days. Then he took leave of his teacher and departed taking her with him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">On the road there was not so much as an exchange of talk between them. Both unhappy they came to Mithilā. Not far from the town, Piṅguttara saw a fig tree covered with fruit, and being hungry he climbed up and ate some of the figs. The girl also being hungry came to the foot of the tree and called out, &ldquo;Throw down some fruit for me too.&rdquo; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;have you no hands or feet? Climb up and get it yourself.&rdquo; She climbed up also and ate. No sooner did he see that she had climbed than he came down quickly, and piled thorns around the tree, and made off saying to himself, &ldquo;I have got rid of the miserable woman at last.&rdquo; She could not get down, but remained sitting where she was.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now the king, who had been amusing himself in the forest, was coming back to town on his elephant in the evening time when he saw her, and fell in love; so he sent to ask had she a husband or no. She replied, &ldquo;Yes, I have a husband to whom my family gave me; but he has gone away and left me here alone.&rdquo; The courtier told this tale to the king, who said: &ldquo;Treasure trove belongs to the Crown.&rdquo; She was brought down and placed on the elephant and conveyed to the palace, where she was sprinkled with the water of consecration as his queen consort. Dear and darling she was to him; and the name Udumbarā or queen Fig was given to her because he first saw her upon a fig tree.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">One day after this, they who dwelt by the city gate had to clean the road for the king to go disporting into his park; and Piṅguttara, who had to earn his living, tucked up his clothes and set to work clearing the road with a hoe. Before the road was clean the king with queen Udumbarā came along in a chariot; and the queen seeing the wretch clearing the road could not restrain her triumph, but smiled to see the wretch there. The king was angry to see her smile, and asked why she did so. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that road-cleaner fellow is my former husband, who made me climb up the fig tree and then piled thorns about it and left me; when I saw him I could not help feeling triumphant at my good fortune, and smiled to see the wretch there.&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;You lie, you laughed at someone else, and I will kill you!&rdquo; And he drew his sword. She was alarmed and said: &ldquo;Sire, pray ask your wise men!&rdquo; The king asked Senaka whether he believed her. &ldquo;No, my lord, I do not,&rdquo; said Senaka, &ldquo;for who would leave such a woman if he once possessed her?&rdquo; When she heard this she was more frightened than ever. But the king thought: &ldquo;What does Senaka know about it? I will ask the sage,&rdquo; and asked him reciting this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4203"></a><a id="a4204"></a><a id="a4205"></a><a id="a4206"></a><span class="t25">1. Itthī siyā rūpavatī, sā ca sīlavatī siyā,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a4230"></a><a id="a4231"></a><span class="t34">The story tells that one day, as he was going his rounds in Sāvatthi for alms, he saw a woman of surpassing beauty, magnificently attired, and fell in love with her, and on returning home to his monastery he was unable to divert his thoughts from her. From that time, as it were, pierced with love&rsquo;s shafts and sick with desire he became as lean as a wild deer, with his veins standing out on his body, and as sallow as sallow could be. He no longer took delight in any one of the Four Postures, or found pleasure in his own thoughts, but giving up all the services due to a teacher he abandoned the use of instruction, inquiry and meditation.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4232"></a><span class="t34">His fellow-monks said: &ldquo;Sir, once you were calm in mind and serene of countenance, but now it is not so. What can be the cause?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I have no pleasure in anything.&rdquo; Then they bade him be happy, saying: &ldquo;To be born [in the time of] a Buddha is a hard matter: so also is the hearing of the True Dhamma, and the attaining to birth as a human being. But you have attained to this, and, yearning to put an end to sorrow, you left your weeping kinsfolk and becoming a believer adopted the ascetic life. Why then do you now fall under the sway of passion? These evil passions are common to all ignorant creatures, from live worms upwards, and such of these passions as are material in their origin, they too are insipid. Desires are full of sorrow and despair: misery in this case ever increases more and more. Desire is like a skeleton or a piece of meat. Desire is like a torch made of a wisp of hay or a light from embers. Desire vanishes like a dream or a loan, or the fruit of a tree. Desire is as biting as a sharp-pointed spear, or as a serpent&rsquo;s head. But you, verily, after embracing such a Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation as this and becoming an ascetic, have now fallen under the sway of such harmful passions.&rdquo; When by their admonitions they failed to make him grasp their teaching, they brought him before the Teacher in the Dhamma Hall. And when he said: &ldquo;Why, monks, have you brought this monk here against his will?&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;They tell us, he is discontent.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this monk was asked by the Teacher whether he were really discontent, he replied that he was. &ldquo;Who,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;has caused you to fall back?&rdquo; He replied that he had seen a woman dressed up in finery, and overcome by passion he had fallen back. Then the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monk, womankind are all ungrateful and treacherous; wise men of old were even so stupid as to give the blood from their own right knee for them to drink, and made them presents all their life long, and yet did not win their hearts.&rdquo; And he told a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{2.116}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when king Brahmadatta reigned over Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as his chief queen&rsquo;s son. On his name-day, they called him prince Paduma, the Lotus prince. After him came six younger brothers. One after another these seven came of age and married and settled down, living as the king&rsquo;s companions.</p>
<p class="p7">One day the king looked out into the palace courts, and as he looked he saw these men with a great following on their way to wait upon himself. He conceived the suspicion that they meant to slay him, and seize his kingdom. So he sent for them, and after this fashion bespake them.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My sons, you may not dwell in this town. So go elsewhere, and when I die you shall return and take the kingdom which belongs to our family.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">They agreed to their father&rsquo;s words; and went home weeping and wailing. &ldquo;It matters not where we go!&rdquo; they cried; and taking their wives with them, they left the city, and journeyed along the road. By and by they came to a wood, where they could get no food or drink. And being unable to bear the pangs of hunger, they determined to save their lives at the women&rsquo;s cost. They seized the youngest brother&rsquo;s wife, and slew her; they cut up her body into thirteen parts, and ate it. But the Bodhisatta and his wife set aside one portion, and ate the other between them.</p>
<p class="p7">Thus they did six days, and slew and ate six of the women; and each day the Bodhisatta set one portion aside, so that he had six portions saved.<span class="t18"> [2.82]</span></p>
<p class="p7">On the seventh day the others would have taken the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s wife to kill her; but instead he gave them the six portions which he had kept. &ldquo;Eat these,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tomorrow I will manage.&rdquo; They all did eat the flesh; and when the time came that they fell asleep, the Bodhisatta and his wife made off together.</p>
<p class="p7">When they had gone a little space, the woman said: &ldquo;Husband, I can go no further.&rdquo; So the Bodhisatta took her upon his shoulders, and at sunrise he came out of the wood. When the sun was risen, said she, &ldquo;Husband, I am thirsty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;There is no water, dear wife!&rdquo; said he. But she begged him again and again, until he struck his right knee with his sword, <span class="t18">{2.117}</span> and said: &ldquo;Water there is none; but sit you down and drink the blood here from my knee.&rdquo; And so she did.</p>
<p class="p7">By and by they came to the mighty Ganges. They drank, they bathed, they ate all manner of fruits, and rested in a pleasant spot. And there by a bend of the river they made an ascetic&rsquo;s hut and took up their abode in it.</p>
<p class="p7">Now it happened that a robber in the regions of Upper Ganges had been guilty of high treason. His hands and feet, and his nose and ears had been cut off, and he was laid in a canoe, and left to drift down the great river. To this place he floated, groaning aloud with pain. The Bodhisatta heard his piteous wailing.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;While I live,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;no poor creature shall perish because of me!&rdquo; and to the river bank he went, and saved the man. He brought him to the hut, and with astringent lotions and ointments he tended his wounds.</p>
<p class="p7">But his wife said to herself, &ldquo;Here is a nice lazy fellow he has fetched out of the Ganges, to look after!&rdquo; and she went about spitting for disgust at the fellow.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4233"></a>Now when the man&rsquo;s wounds were growing together, the Bodhisatta had him to dwell there in the hut along with his wife, and he brought fruits of all kinds from the forest to feed both him and the woman. And as they thus dwelt together, the woman fell in love with the fellow, and did wrong. Then she desired to kill the Bodhisatta, and said to him, &ldquo;Husband, as I sat on your shoulder when I came out from the forest, I saw that hill, and I vowed that if ever you and I should be saved, and come to no harm, I would make offering to the Devatā of the hill. Now this spirit haunts me: and I desire to pay my offering!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, not knowing her guile. He prepared an offering, and delivering to her the vessel of offering, he climbed the hill-top. <span class="t18">{2.118}</span></p>
<p class="p7">Then his wife said to him, &ldquo;Husband, not the hill-spirit, but you are my chief of gods! Then in your honour first of all I will offer wild flowers, and walk reverently <span class="t18">[2.83] </span>round you, keeping you on the right, and salute you: and after that I will make my offering to the mountain spirit.&rdquo; So saying, she placed him facing a precipice, and pretended that she was fain to salute him in reverent fashion. Thus getting behind him, she smote him on the back, and hurled him down the precipice. Then she cried in her joy, &ldquo;I have seen the back of my enemy!&rdquo; and she came down from the mountain, and went into the presence of her lover.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the Bodhisatta tumbled down the cliff; but he stuck fast in a clump of leaves on the top of a fig tree where there were no thorns. Yet he could not get down the hill, so there he sat among the branches, eating the figs. It happened that a huge iguana used to climb the hill from the foot of it, and would eat the fruit of this fig tree. That day he saw the Bodhisatta and took to flight. On the next day, he came and ate some fruit on one side of it. Again and again he came, till at last he struck up a friendship with the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;How did you get to this place?&rdquo; he asked; and the Bodhisatta told him how.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said the iguana; and taking him on his own back, he descended the hill and brought him out of the forest. There he set him upon the high road, and showed him what way he should go, and himself returned to the forest.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4234"></a><a id="a4235"></a>The other proceeded to a certain village, and dwelt there till he heard of his father&rsquo;s death. Upon this he made his way to Benares. There he inherited the kingdom which belonged to his family, and took the name of king Paduma; the ten rules of righteousness for kings he did not transgress, and he ruled uprightly. He built six alms halls, one at each of the four gates, one in the midst of the city, and one before the palace; and every day he distributed in gifts six hundred thousand pieces of money.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the wicked wife took her lover upon her shoulders, and came forth out of the forest; and she went begging among the people, and collected rice and gruel to support him withal. <span class="t18">{2.119}</span><a id="a4236"></a> If she was asked what the man was to her, she would reply, &ldquo;His mother was sister to my father, he is my cousin;<a id="a4237"></a><a href="notes.html#a15119"><span class="t9">{427}</span></a> to him they gave me. Even if he were doomed to death I would take my own husband upon my shoulders, and care for him, and beg food for his living!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4238"></a>&ldquo;What a devoted wife!&rdquo; said all the people. And thenceforward they gave her more food than ever. Some of them also offered advice, saying: &ldquo;Do not live in this way. King Paduma is lord of Benares; he has set all Jambudīpa in a stir by his bounty. It will delight him to see you; so delighted will he be, that he will give you rich gifts. Put your husband <span class="t18">[2.84] </span>in this basket, and make your way to him.&rdquo; So saying, they persuaded her, and gave her a willow basket.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4239"></a>The wicked woman placed her lover in the basket, and taking it up she repaired to Benares, and lived on what she got at the alms halls. Now the Bodhisatta used to ride to an alms-hall upon the back of a splendid elephant richly dressed; and after giving alms to eight or ten people, he would set out again for home. Then the wicked woman placed her lover in the basket, and taking it up, she stood where the king was used to pass. The king saw her. &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;A devoted wife,&rdquo; was the answer. He sent for her, and recognised who she was. He caused the man to be put down from the basket, and asked her, &ldquo;What is this man to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;He is the son of my father&rsquo;s sister, given me by my family, my own husband,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Ah, what a devoted wife!&rdquo; cried they all: for they knew not the ins and outs of it; and they praised the wicked woman.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What &ndash; is the scoundrel your cousin? Did your family give him to you?&rdquo; asked the king, &ldquo;Your husband, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">She did not recognise the king; and, &ldquo;Yes, my lord!&rdquo; said she, as bold as you like.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;And is this the king of Benares&rsquo; son? Are you not the wife of prince Paduma, the daughter of such and such a king, your name so and so? Did not you drink the blood from my knee? Did you not fall in love with this rascal, and throw me down a precipice? Ah, you thought that I was dead, and here you are with death written upon your own forehead &ndash; and here am I, alive!&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.120}</span></p>
<p class="p7">Then he turned to his courtiers. &ldquo;Do you remember what I told you, when you questioned me? My six younger brothers slew their six wives and ate them; but I kept my wife unhurt, and brought her to Ganges&rsquo; bank, where I dwelt in an ascetic&rsquo;s hut: I hauled a condemned criminal out of the river, and supported him; this woman fell in love with him, and threw me down a precipice, but I saved my life by showing kindness. This is no other than the wicked woman who threw me off the crag: this, and no other, is the condemned wretch!&rdquo; And then he uttered the following verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4240"></a><span class="t12">1. Ayam-eva sā, aham-pi so anañño,</span></p>

<p class="p23">But although the Bodhisatta could not swallow his anger, and ordained this punishment for them, he did not do accordingly; but he <span class="t18">[2.85] </span>smothered his wrath, and had the basket fixed upon her head so fast that she could not take it off; the villain he had placed in the same, and they were driven out of his kingdom.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the discontented monk entered on the Fruit of the First Path, &ldquo;In those days certain elders were the six brothers, the young lady Ciñcā was the wife, Devadatta was the criminal, Ānanda was the iguana, and king Paduma was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

Hearing that Devadatta went about to kill him, he said: &ldquo;Monks, this is not the only time that Devadatta has been trying to kill me; he tried to do so before, and failed.&rdquo; Then he told them this story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, when the Bodhisatta came to life as the son of a householder who lived in a village not far from the city.</p>
<p class="p7">When he came to years, they fetched a young lady of family from Benares to marry him. She was a fair and lovely maiden, beautiful as a Devaccharā, graceful like a twining creeper, ravishing as a Kinnarī. Her name was Sujātā; she was faithful, virtuous, and dutiful. She always did duly her duty to her lord and his parents. This girl was very dear and precious to the Bodhisatta. <span class="t18">{2.122}</span> So they two dwelt together in joy, and unity, and oneness of mind.</p>
<p class="p7">One day Sujātā said to her husband, &ldquo;I have a wish to see my mother and father.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very good, my wife,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;make ready food sufficient for the journey.&rdquo; He caused food of all sorts to be cooked, and placed the provisions in a wagon; since he drove the vehicle, he sat in front, and his wife behind. To Benares they went; and there they unyoked the wagon, and washed, and ate. Then the Bodhisatta yoked the oxen <span class="t18">[2.86] </span>again, and sat in front; and Sujātā, who had changed her dress and adorned herself, sat behind.</p>
<p class="p7">As the wagon entered the city, the king of Benares happened to he making a solemn circuit round the place mounted upon the back of a splendid elephant; and he passed by that place. Sujātā had come down out of the cart, and was walking behind on foot. The king saw her: her beauty so attracted his eye, that he became enamoured of her. He called one of his suite. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and find out whether that woman has a husband or no.&rdquo; The man did as he was bid, and came back to tell the king. &ldquo;She has a husband, I am told,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you see that man sitting in the cart yonder? He is her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4271"></a>The king could not smother his passion, and a wrong thought entered into his mind. &ldquo;I will find some way of getting rid of this fellow,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and then I will take the wife myself.&rdquo; Calling to a man, he said: &ldquo;Here, my good fellow, take this jewelled crest, and make as though you were passing down the street. As you go, drop it in the wagon of that man.&rdquo; So saying, he gave him a jewelled crest, and dismissed him. The man took it, and went; as he passed the wagon, he dropped it in; then he returned, and reported to the king that it was done. &ldquo;I have lost a jewelled crest!&rdquo; cried the king: the whole place was in an uproar.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Shut all the gates!&rdquo; the king gave order, &ldquo;cut off the outlets! Hunt the thief!&rdquo; The king&rsquo;s followers obeyed. The city was all confusion! The other man, taking some others with him, went up to the Bodhisatta, crying, &ldquo;Hello! Stop your cart! <span class="t18">{2.123}</span> The king has lost a jewelled crest; we must search your cart!&rdquo; And search it he did, till he found the jewel which he had put there himself. &ldquo;Thief!&rdquo; cried he, seizing the Bodhisatta; they beat him and kicked him; then binding his arms behind him they dragged him before the king, crying out, &ldquo;See the thief who stole your jewel!&rdquo; &ldquo;Off with his head!&rdquo; was the king&rsquo;s command. They scourged him with whips, and tormented him at every street corner, and cast him out of the city by the south gates.</p>
<p class="p7">Now Sujātā left the wagon, and stretching out her arms she ran after him, wailing as she went, &ldquo;O my husband, it is I who brought you into this woeful plight!&rdquo; The king&rsquo;s servants threw the Bodhisatta upon his back, with the intent to cut off his head. When she saw this, Sujātā thought upon her own goodness and virtue, reflecting thus within herself, &ldquo;I suppose there can be no spirit here strong enough to stay the hand of cruel and wicked men, who work mischief to the virtuous,&rdquo; and weeping and wailing she repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4272"></a><a id="a4273"></a><a id="a4274"></a><a id="a4275"></a><a id="a4276"></a><span class="t12">1. Na santi Devā, pavasanti nūna,</span></p>

The uncontrolled, behaving with violence, there are surely none who can ward them off. </span><span class="t18">[2.87]</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a4284"></a>As this virtuous woman thus lamented, the throne of Sakka, King of the Devas, grew hot as he sat upon it. <span class="t18">{2.124}</span><a id="a4285"></a> &ldquo;Who is it that would make me fall from my throne?&rdquo; thought Sakka. Then he was aware of what was befalling. &ldquo;The king of Benares,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;is doing a very cruel deed. He is making the virtuous Sujātā miserable; now I must go there!&rdquo; So descending from the heavenly world, by his own power he dismounted the wicked king from the elephant on whose back he was riding, and laid him upon his back in the place of execution, but the Bodhisatta he caught up, and decked him with all kinds of ornaments, and made the king&rsquo;s dress come upon him, and set him on the back of the king&rsquo;s elephant. The servants lifted the axe and smote off a head &ndash; but it was the king&rsquo;s head; and when it was off, they knew that it was the head of the king.</p>
<p class="p7">Sakka took upon him a visible body, and came before the Bodhisatta, and consecrated him to be king; and caused the place of chief queen to be given to Sujātā. And as the courtiers, the brahmins and householders, and the rest, saw Sakka, King of the Devas, they rejoiced, saying: &ldquo;The unrighteous king is slain! Now have we received from the hands of Sakka a king who is righteous!&rdquo; And Sakka stood poised in the air, and declared, &ldquo;This your righteous king from this time forth shall rule in righteousness. If a king be unrighteous, god sends rain out of season, and in season he sends no rain: and fear of famine, fear of pestilence, fear of the sword &ndash; these three fears come upon men for him.&rdquo; Thus did he instruct them, and spake this second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4286"></a><span class="t12">2. Akāle vassatī tassa, kāle tassa na vassati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4287"></a><a id="a4288"></a><a id="a4289"></a><a id="a4290"></a><span class="t12">Saggā ca cavati ṭhānā, nanu so tāvatā hato ti.</span></p>

<p class="p23">Thus did Sakka admonish a great concourse of folk, and then he went straight to his divine abode. And the Bodhisatta reigned in righteousness, and then went to swell the hosts of heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended this discourse, thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Devadatta was the wicked king; Anuruddha was Sakka; Sujātā was Rāhula&rsquo;s mother; but the king by Sakka&rsquo;s gift was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7">Now one of the king&rsquo;s court intrigued in the harem, and the king learned all about it. &ldquo;He is a most useful servant,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and the woman is dear to me. I cannot destroy these two. <span class="t18">{2.126}</span> I will put a question to some wise man of my court; and if I must put up with it, put up with it I will; if not, then I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">He sent for the Bodhisatta, and bade him be seated. &ldquo;Wise sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have a question to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Ask it, O king! I will make answer,&rdquo; replied the other. Then the king asked his question in the words of the first couplet:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4303"></a><a id="a4304"></a><a id="a4305"></a><a id="a4306"></a><span class="t12">1. Pabbatūpatthare ramme jātā pokkharaṇī sivā,</span></p>

<p class="p23">&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;one of his courtiers must have intrigued in the harem,&rdquo; and he recited the second couplet:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4312"></a><a id="a4313"></a><span class="t12">2. Pivanti ce mahārāja sāpadāni mahānadiṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p23">Thus did the Great Being advise the king.</p>
<p class="p7">And the king abode by this advice, and he forgave them both, bidding them go and do wrong no more. And from that time they ceased. And the king gave alms, and did good, till at his life&rsquo;s end he went to fill the hosts of heaven. <span class="t18">[2.89]</span></p>
<p class="p7">And the king of Kosala also, after hearing this discourse, forgave both these people and remained indifferent.</p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is tempted to go back to the lay life by the sight of a woman in her finery. The Buddha tells a story of how Yakkhinis used to capture lost merchants, take them to husband and then devour them when they were finished with them. The Bodhisatta in the guise of a flying horse managed to save half of those in captivity, who later become his disciples.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the flying horse king (valāhakassarājā),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;They who will neglect.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying in Jetavana, about a monk who had become discontent.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher asked him if it was really true that he was discontent, the monk replied that it was true. Being questioned for the reason, he replied that his passion had been aroused by seeing a finely dressed woman. Then the Teacher thus addressed him:</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Monk, these women tempt men by their figure and voice, scents, perfumes, and touch, and by their wiles and dalliance; thus they get men into their power; and as soon as they perceive that this is done, they ruin them, character, wealth and all, by their evil ways. This gives them the name of Yakkhinis. In former days also a troop of Yakkhinis tempted a caravan of traders, and got power over them; and afterwards, when they got sight of other men, they killed every one of themt, and then devoured them, crunching them in their teeth while the blood ran down over both cheeks.&rdquo; And then he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, there was in the island of Ceylon a Yakkha town called Sirīsavatthu, peopled by Yakkhinis. When a ship is wrecked, these adorn and deck themselves, and taking rice and gruel, with trains of slaves, and their children on their hip, they come up to the merchants. <span class="t18">{2.128}</span><a id="a4326"></a><a id="a4327"></a> In order to make them imagine that theirs is a city of human beings, they make them see here and there men ploughing and tending kine, herds of cattle, dogs, and the like. Then approaching the merchants they invite them to partake of the gruel, rice, and other food which they bring. The merchants, all unaware, eat of what is offered. When they have eaten and drunken, and are taking their rest, the Yakkhas address them thus, &ldquo;Where do you live? Where do you come from? Whither are you going, and what errand brought you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;We were shipwrecked here,&rdquo; they reply. &ldquo;Very good, noble sirs,&rdquo; the others make answer, &ldquo; &rsquo;tis three years ago since our own husbands went on board ship; they <span class="t18">[2.90] </span><a id="a4328"></a><a id="a4329"></a>must have perished. You are merchants too; we will be your wives.&rdquo; Thus they lead them astray by their women&rsquo;s wiles, and tricks, and dalliance, until they get them into the Yakkha city; then, if they have any others already caught, they bind these with magic chains, and cast them into the house of torment. And if they find no shipwrecked men in the place where they dwell, they scour the coast as far as the river Kalyāṇi<a id="a4330"></a><a href="notes.html#a15121"><span class="t9">{428}</span></a> on one side and the island of Nāgadīpa on the other. This is their way.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4331"></a>Now it happened once that five hundred shipwrecked traders were cast ashore near the city of these Yakkhinis. The Yakkhas came up to them and enticed them, till they brought them to their city; those whom they had caught before, they bound with magic chains and cast them into the house of torment. Then the chief Yakkhini took the chief man, and the others took the rest, till five hundred had the five hundred traders; and they made the men their husbands. Then in the night time, when her man was asleep, the chief Yakkhini rose up, and made her way to the house of death, slew some of the men and ate them. The others did the same. When the eldest Yakkhini returned from eating men&rsquo;s flesh, her body was cold. The eldest merchant embraced her, and perceived that she was a Yakkhini. <span class="t18">{2.129}</span> &ldquo;All the five hundred of them must be Yakkhas!&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;we must make our escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4332"></a>So in the early morning, when he went to wash his face, he bespake the other merchants in these words. &ldquo;These are Yakkhinis, and not human beings! As soon as other shipwrecked men can be found, they will make them their husbands, and will eat us; come &ndash; let us escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Two hundred and fifty of them replied, &ldquo;We cannot leave them: go you, if you will, but we will not flee away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the chief trader with two hundred and fifty, who were ready to obey him, fled away in fear of the Yakkhinis.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4333"></a>Now at that time, the Bodhisatta had come into the world as a flying horse,<a id="a4334"></a><a href="notes.html#a15123"><span class="t9">{429}</span></a><a id="a4335"></a> white all over, and beaked like a crow, with hair like muñja grass,<a id="a4336"></a><a href="notes.html#a15125"><span class="t9">{430}</span></a> possessed of Supernormal Powers, able to fly through the air. From the Himālayas he flew through the air until he came to Ceylon. There he passed over the ponds and tanks of Ceylon, and ate the paddy that grew wild there. As he passed on thus, he thrice uttered human speech filled with mercy, saying: &ldquo;Who wants to go home? Who wants to go home?&rdquo; The traders heard his saying, and cried, &ldquo;We are going home, master!&rdquo; joining their hands, and raising them respectfully to their foreheads. &ldquo;Then climb up on my back,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta. Thereat some of <span class="t18">[2.91] </span>them climbed up, some laid hold of his tail, and some remained standing, with a respectful salute. Then the Bodhisatta took up even those who stood still saluting him, and conveyed all of them, even two hundred and fifty, to their own country, and set down each in his own place; then he went back to his place of dwelling.</p>
<p class="p7">And the Yakkhinis, when other men came to that place, slew those two hundred and fifty who were left, and devoured them.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher now said, addressing the monks, &ldquo;Monks, even as these traders perished by falling into the hands of Yakkhinis, but the others by obeying the behest of the wonderful horse each returned safe home again; so, even so, they who neglect the advice of the Buddhas, both monks and nuns, lay brethren and lay sisters, <span class="t18">{2.130}</span><a id="a4337"></a> come to great misery in the four hells, places where they are punished under the five fetters, and so forth. But those who abide by such advice come to the three kinds of fortunate birth, the six heavens of sense, the twenty Brahmā Realms, and reaching the state of the imperishable Nibbāna they attain great blessedness.&rdquo; Then, after Fully Awakening, he recited the following verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4338"></a><a id="a4339"></a><a id="a4340"></a><span class="t12">1. Ye na kāhanti ovādaṁ narā Buddhena desitaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This monk took a piece of cloth, that had been given to his teacher, feeling confident that if he took it his teacher would not be angry. Then he made a shoe-bag of it, and took his leave. When this teacher asked why he took it, he replied he had felt confident, if he did, that his teacher would not be angry. The teacher flew into a passion, </span><span class="t18">{2.131}</span><span class="t30"> got up and struck him a blow. &ldquo;What confidence is there between you and me?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This fact became known among the Saṅgha. One day the monks were all together talking about it in the Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;Friend, young monk </span><span class="t18">[2.92]</span><span class="t30"> So-and-so felt so confident of his teacher&rsquo;s friendship, that he took a piece of cloth, and made it into a shoe-bag. Then the teacher asked him what confidence there was between them, flew into a passion, jumped up, and gave him a blow.&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and asked them what they were talking of as they sat there together. They told him. Then he said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that this man has disappointed the confidence of his fellow. He did the same before.&rdquo; And then he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as a brahmin&rsquo;s son in the realm of Kāsi. When he came of age, he renounced the world; he caused to grow in him the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and took up his abode in the region of the Himālayas with a band of disciples. One of this band of ascetics disobeyed the voice of the Bodhisatta, and kept a young elephant which had lost its mate. This creature by and by grew big, then killed its master and made off into the forest. The ascetics did his obsequies; and then, coming about the Bodhisatta, they put this question to him.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sir, how may we know whether one is a friend or an enemy?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">This the Bodhisatta declared to them in the following verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4355"></a><span class="t12">1. Na naṁ umhayate disvā, na ca naṁ paṭinandati,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">We hear that the Teacher asked him if he really were discontent; and he replied, yes, he was. Being asked the reason, he replied, &ldquo;Because my passions </span><span class="t18">[2.93] </span><span class="t30">were aroused on seeing a woman in her finery.&rdquo; Then the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monk, there is no guarding women. In days of yore, watchers were placed to guard the doors, and yet they could not keep them safe; even when you have got them, you cannot keep them.&rdquo; And he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta came into the world as a young parrot. His name was Rādha, and his youngest brother was named Poṭṭhapāda. While they were yet quite young, both of them were caught by a fowler and handed over to a brahmin in Benares. The brahmin cared for them as if they were his children. <span class="t18">{2.133}</span> But the brahmin&rsquo;s wife was a wicked woman; there was no guarding her.</p>
<p class="p7">The husband had to go away on business, and addressed his young parrots thus. &ldquo;Little dears, I am going away on business. Keep watch on your mother in season and out of season; observe whether or not any man visits her.&rdquo; So off he went, leaving his wife in charge of the young parrots.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4376"></a>As soon as he was gone, the woman began to do wrong; night and day the visitors came and went &ndash; there was no end to them. Poṭṭhapāda, observing this, said to Rādha, &ldquo;Our master gave this woman into our charge, and here she is doing wickedness. I will speak to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Rādha. But the other would not listen. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why do you do wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">How she longed to kill him! But making as though she would fondle him, she called him to her.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Little one, you are my son! I will never do it again! Here, then, the dear!&rdquo; So he came out; then she seized him crying, &ldquo;What! You preach to <span class="t11">me</span>! You don&rsquo;t know your measure!&rdquo; and she wrung his neck, and threw him into the oven.</p>
<p class="p7">The brahmin returned. When he had rested, he asked the Bodhisatta: &ldquo;Well, my dear, what about your mother &ndash; does she do wrong, or no?&rdquo; and as he asked the question, he repeated the first couplet:</p>

<p class="p23">Rādha answered, &ldquo;Father dear, the wise speak not of things which do not conduce to blessing, whether they have happened or not,&rdquo; and he explained this by repeating the second couplet: <span class="t18">{2.134}</span></p>

<p class="p7">At that time all the grain had been carried away during the rainy season, and there was a famine. But it was the time when the corn had just sprouted; and all the villagers came together, and besought help of their headman, saying: &ldquo;Two months from now, when we have harvested the grain, we will pay you in kind,&rdquo; so they got an old ox from him, and ate it.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, the headman watched his chance, and when the Bodhisatta was gone abroad he visited the house. Just as the two were happy together, the Bodhisatta came in by the village gate, and set his face towards home. The woman was looking towards the village gate, and saw him. &ldquo;Why, who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she wondered, looking at him as he stood on the threshold. &ldquo;It is he!&rdquo; She knew him, and she told the headman. He trembled in terror. <span class="t18">[2.95]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;I have a plan. You know we have had meat from you to eat: make as though you were seeking the price of the meat; I will climb up into the granary; and stand at the door of it, crying. &lsquo;No rice here!&rsquo; while you must stand in the middle of the room, and call out insisting, again and again, &lsquo;I have children at home; give me the price of the meat!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So saying, she climbed up to the granary, and sat in the door of it. The other stood in the midst of the house, and cried, &ldquo;Give me the price of the meat,&rdquo; while she replied, sitting at the granary door, &ldquo;There is no rice in the granary; I will give it when the harvest is home: leave me now!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The goodman entered the house, and saw what they were about. &ldquo;This must be that wicked woman&rsquo;s plan,&rdquo; he thought, and he called to the headman.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sir headman, when we had some of your old ox to eat, we promised to give you rice for it in two months&rsquo; time. Not half a month has passed; then why do you try to make us pay now? That&rsquo;s not the reason you are here: you must have come for something else. I don&rsquo;t like your ways. That wicked and sinful woman yonder knows that there is no rice in the garner, but she has climbed up, and there she sits, crying <span class="t18">{2.136}</span> &lsquo;No rice here!&rsquo; and you cry &lsquo;Give!&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t like your doings, either of you!&rdquo; and to make his meaning clear, he uttered these lines:</p>

<p class="p23">So saying, he seized the headman by the lock of hair on the top of his head, dragged him out into the courtyard, threw him down, and as he cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the headman!&rdquo; mocked him thus, &ldquo;Damages, please, for injury done to the chattels under another man&rsquo;s watch and ward!&rdquo; while he thrashed him till the man was faint. Then he took him by the neck and cast him out of the house. The wicked woman he seized by the hair of her head, pulled her away from the garner, knocked her down, and threatened her, &ldquo;If you ever do this kind of thing again, I&rsquo;ll make you remember it!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">From that day forward the headman did not even look at that house, and the woman did not dare to transgress even in thought. <span class="t18">{2.137}</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This man, we are told, had four daughters. Four suitors wooed them; one was fine and handsome, one was old and well advanced in years, the third a man of family, and the fourth was good. He thought to himself, &ldquo;When a man is settling his daughters and disposing of them, whom should he give them to? The handsome man or the oldish man, or one of the other two, the highly born or the very virtuous man?&rdquo; Ponder as he would, he could not decide. So he thought he would tell the matter to the Supreme Buddha, who would be sure to know; and then he would give the girls to the most suitable wooer. So he had a quantity of perfumes and garlands prepared, and visited the monastery. Saluting the Teacher, he sat on one side, and told him everything from beginning to end; then he asked, &ldquo;To which of these four should I give my daughters?&rdquo; To this the Teacher replied, &ldquo;In olden days, as now, wise men asked this question; but now that rebirth has confused your memory, you cannot remember the case.&rdquo; And then at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta ruled in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as a brahmin&rsquo;s son. He came of age, and received his education at Taxila; then on returning he became a famous teacher.</p>
<p class="p7">Now there was a brahmin who had four daughters. These four were wooed by four persons as told above. The brahmin could not decide to whom to give them. &ldquo;I will enquire of the teacher,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and then he shall have them to whom they should be given.&rdquo; So he came into the teacher&rsquo;s presence, and repeated the first couplet:</p>

<p class="p23">Hearing this, the teacher replied, &ldquo;Even though there be beauty and the like qualities, a man is to be despised if he fail in virtue. Therefore the former is not the measure of a man; those that I like are the virtuous.&rdquo; And in explanation of this matter, he repeated the second couplet:</p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a4463"></a><span class="t30">At the time of this story we hear that a gang of burglars, highwaymen, and murderers had been caught and brought before the king of Kosala. The king ordered them to be made fast with chains, and ropes, and fetters. Thirty country monks, desirous of seeing the Teacher, had paid him a visit and offered their salutations. Next day, as they were seeking alms, they passed the prison and noticed these rascals. In the evening, after their return from the day&rsquo;s rounds, they approached the Tathāgata, &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;today, as we were seeking alms, we saw in the prison-house a number of criminals bound fast in chains and fetters, being in great misery. They could not break these fetters, and run away. Is there any fetter stronger than these?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher replied, &ldquo;Monks, those are fetters, it is true; but the fetters which consist of a craving for wealth, corn, sons, wives and children are stronger than they are a hundred-fold, nay a thousand-fold. Yet even those fetters, hard to break as they are, have been broken by wise men of old, who went to the Himālayas and became ascetics.&rdquo; Then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, while Brahmadatta ruled over Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a poor man&rsquo;s family. When he grew up, his father died. He earned wages, and supported his mother. His mother, much against his will, brought a wife home for him, and soon after died. Now his wife conceived. Not knowing that she had conceived, he said to her, &ldquo;Wife, you must earn your living; I will renounce the world.&rdquo; Then said she, &ldquo;Nay, for I am with child. <span class="t18">{2.140}</span> Wait and see the child that is born of me, and then go and become an ascetic.&rdquo; To this he agreed. So when she was delivered, he said: &ldquo;Now, wife, you are safely delivered, and I must turn ascetic.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;till the time when the child is weaned.&rdquo; And after that she conceived again.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;If I agree to her request,&rdquo; thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;I shall never get away at all. I will flee without saying a word to her, and become an ascetic.&rdquo; So he told her nothing, but rose up in the night, and fled away. <span class="t18">[2.98]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4464"></a>The city guards seized him. &ldquo;I have a mother to support,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let me go!&rdquo; thus he made them let him go free, and after staying in a certain place, he passed out by the chief gate and made his way to the Himālayas, where he lived as a recluse; and caused the Super Knowledges and Attainments to spring up within him, as he dwelt in the rapture of meditation. As he dwelt there, he exulted, saying: &ldquo;The bond of wife and child, the bond of passion, so hard to break, is broken!&rdquo; and he uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4465"></a><a id="a4466"></a><span class="t12">1. Na taṁ daḷhaṁ bandhanam-āhu dhīrā,</span></p>

The Buddha tells how in a past life the monk had been a king and had mocked old people and made life difficult for them until Sakka came down to teach him a lesson in impermanence.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (the King of the Devas) Sakka,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Geese, herons, elephants.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {2.142}</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about Lakuṇṭaka the venerable and good.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4504"></a><span class="t30">Now this venerable Lakuṇṭaka, we learn, was well known in the dispensation of the Buddha, a famous man, speaking sweet words, a honeyed preacher, having the analytic knowledges, with his passions perfectly subdued, but in stature the smallest of all the eighty elders, no bigger than a novice, like a dwarf kept for amusement.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day, he had been to the gate of Jetavana to salute the Tathāgata, when thirty brothers from the country arrived at the gate on their way to salute him too. When they saw the elder, they imagined him to be some novice; they pulled the corner of his robe, they caught his hands, held his head, tweaked his nose, got him by the ears and shook him, and handled him very rudely; then </span><span class="t18">[2.99] </span><span class="t30">after putting aside their bowl and robe, they visited the Teacher and saluted him. Next they asked him, &ldquo;Sir, we understand that you have an elder who goes by the name of Lakuṇṭaka the Good, a honeyed preacher. Where is he?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you want to see him?&rdquo; the Teacher asked. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;He is the man you saw by the gate, and twitched his robe and pulled him about with great rudeness before you came here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; asked they, &ldquo;how is it that a man devoted to prayer, full of high aspirations, a true disciple &ndash; how is it he is so insignificant?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because of his own defilements,&rdquo; answered the Teacher; and at their request he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when king Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta became Sakka, King of the Devas. Brahmadatta could not endure to look upon anything old or decrepit, whether elephant, horse, ox, or what not. He was full of pranks, and whenever he saw any such, he would chase them away; old carts he had broken up; any old women that he saw he sent for, and beat upon the belly, then stood them up again and gave them a scare; he made old men roll about and play on the ground like tumblers. If he saw none, but only heard that there was a greybeard in such and such a town, <span class="t18">{2.143}</span> he sent for him thence and took his sport with him.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4505"></a>At this the people for very shame sent their parents outside the boundaries of the kingdom. No more did men tend or care for their mother and father. The king&rsquo;s friends were as wanton as he. As men died, they filled up the four<a id="a4506"></a><a href="notes.html#a15129"><span class="t9">{432}</span></a> worlds of unhappiness; the company of the gods grew less and less.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a4507"></a>Sakka saw that there were no newcomers among the Devaputtas; and he cast about him what was to be done. At last he hit upon a plan. &ldquo;I will humble him!&rdquo; thought Sakka; and he took upon him the form of an old man, and placing two jars of buttermilk in a crazy old wagon, he yoked to it a pair of old oxen, and set out upon a feast day. Brahmadatta, mounted upon a richly caparisoned elephant, was making a solemn procession about the city, which was all decorated; and Sakka, clad in rags, and driving this cart, came to meet the king. When the king saw the old cart, he shouted, &ldquo;Away with that cart, you!&rdquo; But his people answered, &ldquo;Where is it, my lord? We cannot see any cart!&rdquo; (for Sakka by his power let it be seen by no one but the king). And, coming up to the king repeatedly, at last Sakka, still driving his cart, smashed one of the jars upon the king&rsquo;s head, and made him turn round; then he smashed the other in like manner. And the buttermilk trickled down on either side of his head. Thus was the king plagued and tormented, and made miserable by Sakka&rsquo;s doings. <span class="t18">[2.100]</span></p>
<p class="p7">When Sakka saw his distress, he made the cart disappear, and took his proper shape again. Poised in mid-air, thunderbolt in hand, he upbraided him, &ldquo;O wicked and unrighteous king! Will you never become old yourself? Will not age assail you? Yet you sport and mock, and do despite to those who are old! It is through you alone, and these doings of yours, that men die on every hand, and fill up the four worlds of unhappiness, and that men cannot care for their parents&rsquo; welfare! If you do not cease from this, I will cleave your head with my thunderbolt. Go, and do so no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">With this rebuke, he declared the worth of parents, and made known the advantage of reverencing old age; after which discourse he departed to his own place. From that time forward the king never so much as thought of doing anything like what he had done before. <span class="t18">{2.144}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This story ended, the Teacher, after Fully Awakening, recited these two couplets:</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">In the Dhamma Hall </span><span class="t18">[2.101] </span><span class="t30">they began talking about it; saying how monk So-and-so was sitting at his door, chopping wood, when a snake bit him, and he died immediately of the bite. </span><span class="t18">{2.145} </span><span class="t30">The Teacher came in, and wanted to know what they were discussing as they sat there together. They told him. Said he, &ldquo;Monks, if our monk had practised loving-kindness towards the four royal races of serpents, that snake would not have bitten him: wise ascetics in by-gone days, before the Buddha was born, by using kindness to these four royal races, were released from the fear that sprang from these serpents.&rdquo; Then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, during the reign of Brahmadatta king of Benares, the Bodhisatta came into the world as a young brahmin of Kāsi. When he came of age, he quelled his passions and took upon him the life of an ascetic; he developed the Super Knowledges and Attainments; he built a hermitage by the bend of the Ganges near the foot of the Himālayas, and there he dwelt, surrounded by a band of ascetics, lost in the rapture of meditation.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time there were many kinds of snakes upon the Ganges bank, which did mischief to the ascetics, and many of them perished by snake-bite. The ascetics told the matter to the Bodhisatta. He summoned all the ascetics to meet him, and thus addressed them, &ldquo;If you showed goodwill to the four royal races of snakes, no serpents would bite you. Therefore from this time forward do you show goodwill to the four royal races.&rdquo; Then he added this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4528"></a><a id="a4529"></a><a id="a4530"></a><span class="t12">1. Virūpakkhehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ Erāpathehi me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4531"></a><span class="t12">Chabyāputtehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ Kaṇhāgotamakehi cā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4532"></a><span class="t4">I am friendly with the Virūpakkhas, with the Erāpathas I am friendly, I am friendly with the Chabyāputtas, friendly with the Kaṇhāgotamakas.</span></p>
<p class="p23">After thus naming the four royal families of the snakes, he added, &ldquo;If you can cultivate goodwill towards these, no snake creature will bite you or do you harm.&rdquo; Then he repeated the second verse: <span class="t18">{2.146}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4533"></a><a id="a4534"></a><span class="t12">2. Apādakehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ dvipādakehi me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4535"></a><span class="t12">Catuppadehi me mettaṁ, mettaṁ bahuppadehi me ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">I&rsquo;m friendly with those without feet, with those with two feet I&rsquo;m friendly, I&rsquo;m friendly with those with four feet, with those with many feet I&rsquo;m friendly.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Having declared the nature of the love within him, he uttered another verse by way of prayer:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4536"></a><a id="a4537"></a><span class="t12">3. Mā maṁ apādako hiṁsi, mā maṁ hiṁsi dvipādako,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mā maṁ catuppado hiṁsi, mā maṁ hiṁsi bahuppado ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4538"></a><a id="a4539"></a><a id="a4540"></a><span class="t4">May the one without feet not hurt me, may the one with two feet not hurt me, may the one with four feet not hurt me, may the one with many feet not hurt me. </span><span class="t18">[2.102]</span></p>
<p class="p23">Then again, in general terms, he repeated one verse more:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4541"></a><a id="a4542"></a><span class="t12">4. Sabbe sattā, sabbe pāṇā, sabbe bhūtā ca kevalā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sabbe bhadrāni passantu, mā kañci pāpam-āgamā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4543"></a><a id="a4544"></a><a id="a4545"></a><a id="a4546"></a><a id="a4547"></a><span class="t4">May all beings, all living creatures, all beings entirely, may all see prosperity, may nothing bad come to anyone. </span><span class="t18">{2.147}</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus did he set forth how one must show love and goodwill to all creatures without distinction; he reminded his hearers of the virtues of the Three Jewels, saying: &ldquo;Infinite is the Buddha, infinite the Dhamma, and infinite the Saṅgha.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Remember the quality of the Three Jewels,&rdquo; and thus having shown them the infinity of the Three Jewels, and wishing to show them that all beings are finite, he added, &ldquo;Finite and measurable are creeping things, snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders, lizards, mice.&rdquo; Then again, &ldquo;As the passions and sensual desires in these creatures are the qualities which make them finite and limited, let us be protected night and day against these finite things by the power of the Three Jewels, which are infinite: wherefore remember the worth of the Three Jewels.&rdquo; Then he recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4548"></a><span class="t12">5. Katā me rakkhā, katā me parittā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a4549"></a><span class="t12">Paṭikkamantu bhūtāni!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sohaṁ namo Bhagavato,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Namo sattannaṁ Sammāsambuddhānan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a4550"></a><a id="a4551"></a><a id="a4552"></a><a id="a4553"></a><span class="t4">I have made this protection, I have made this safeguard, may all these beings go away! I revere the Fortunate One, I revere the seven Perfect Sambuddhas. </span><span class="t18">{2.148}</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a4554"></a>And bidding them also remember the seven Buddhas<a id="a4555"></a><a href="notes.html#a15133"><span class="t9">{434}</span></a> while they did honour, the Bodhisatta composed this guardian charm and delivered it to his band of sages. Thenceforward the sages bore in mind the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s admonition, and cherished loving-kindness, and remembered the Buddha&rsquo;s virtues. As they did this, all the snake kind departed from them. And the Bodhisatta cultivated the Divine Abidings, and attained to Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The Buddha&rsquo;s followers were then the followers of the sage; and their Teacher was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
