<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present four Jaina female ascetics win victories everywhere until they are defeated by Ven. Sāriputta, and they convert and ask to ordain. The Buddha tells a story in which four daughters are an enticement to war. They are taken into a harem of an opposing king, and their father offers to do battle, and hears from Sakka that he will win. Through heroism though his opponent beats him, and he offers up a dowry for his daughters.</span><a id="a8128"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15409"><span class="t15">{558}</span></a><a id="a8129"></a></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the ascetic (tāpasa),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Sāriputta = (the minister) Nandisena,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a8130"></a><span class="t15">the young nuns = the king of Kāliṅga&rsquo;s daughters (Kāliṅgarañño dhītaro).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a8131"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Argumentation, Bravery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Open the gate.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.1] {3.1}</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while living at Jetavana, about the admission of four female ascetics to the ascetic life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Tradition says that Licchavis of the ruling family to the number of seven thousand seven hundred and seven had their abode at Vesālī. And all of them were given to argument and debate.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now a certain Jain, skilled in maintaining five hundred different theses, arrived at Vesālī and met with a kind reception there. A female Jain too of a similar character also came to Vesālī and the Licchavi chiefs got up a debate between them. And when they proved well matched as disputants, the Licchavis were struck with the notion that such a pair would be sure to have clever children. So they arranged a marriage between them, and as the issue of this union in due course four daughters and a son were born. The daughters were named Saccā, Lolā, Avavādakā, and Paṭācārā, and the boy was called Saccaka. These five children when they reached years of discretion learned a thousand different theses, five hundred from the mother and five hundred from the father. And the parents schooled their daughters in this manner, &ldquo;If any layman refutes your thesis, you are to become his wives, but if a monk refutes you, you must take orders at his hands.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After a time their parents died, and when they were dead, the Jain Saccaka lived on in the same place at Vesālī, studying the lore of the Licchavis. </span><span class="t18">{3.2}</span><span class="t30"> But his sisters took in their hands a branch of the Jambu plum tree, and in the course of their wanderings from city to city for purposes of debate, at last reached Sāvatthi. There they planted the Jambu plum branch at the city gate and said to some boys who were there, &ldquo;If any man, be he layman or monk, is equal to maintaining a thesis against us, let him scatter with his foot this heap of dust and trample under foot this branch.&rdquo; And with these words they went into the city to collect alms.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8132"></a><a id="a8133"></a><span class="t30">Now the venerable Sāriputta, after sweeping up wherever it was necessary, and putting water into the empty pots and tending the sick, later on in the day went into Sāvatthi for alms. And when he had seen and heard about the branch, he ordered the boys to throw it down and trample upon it. &ldquo;Let those,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by whom this branch has been planted, as soon as they have finished their meal, come and see me in the gable-chamber over the gate of Jetavana.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.2]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So he went into the city, and when he had ended his meal, he took his stand in the chamber over the monastery gate. The female ascetics too, after going their rounds for alms, returned and found the branch had been trampled on. And when they asked who had done this, the boys told them it was Sāriputta, and if they were anxious for a debate, they were to go to the chamber over the gate of the monastery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8134"></a><a id="a8135"></a><span class="t30">So they returned to the city, and followed by a great crowd went to the gate-tower of the monastery, and presented to the monk a thousand different theses. The monk solved all their difficulties and then asked them if they knew any more.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">They replied, &ldquo;No, my Lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will ask you something.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ask on, my Lord,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and if we know it, we will answer you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So the monk presented just one question to them, and when they had to give it up, the monk told them the answer. Then they said: &ldquo;We are beaten, the victory rests with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;What will you do now?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Our parents,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;admonished us thus: &lsquo;If you are refuted in debate by a layman, you are to become his wives, but if by a monk, you are to receive orders at his hands&rsquo;. Therefore, admit us to the ascetic life,&rdquo; they said.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monk readily agreed and ordained them near the nun called Uppalavaṇṇā and all of them shortly became Arahats.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8136"></a><span class="t30">Then one day they started this topic in the Dhamma Hall, how that Sāriputta proved a refuge to the four female ascetics, and that through him they all became Arahats. When the Teacher came and heard the nature of their discourse, he said: &ldquo;Not only now, but in former times too, Sāriputta proved a refuge to these women. </span><span class="t18">{3.3}</span><span class="t30"> On this occasion he dedicated them to the ascetic life, but formerly he raised them to the dignity of queen consort.&rdquo; Then he told them a story about the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8137"></a>In the past when Kāliṅga was reigning in the city of Dantapura in the Kāliṅga<a id="a8138"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15411"><span class="t9">{559}</span></a> kingdom, Assaka was king of Potali in the Assaka country. Now Kāliṅga had a fine army and was himself as strong as an elephant, but could find no one to fight with him. So being eager for a fray he said to his ministers, &ldquo;I am longing to fight but can find no one to war with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">His ministers said: &ldquo;Sire, there is one way open to you. You have four daughters of surpassing beauty. Bid them adorn themselves with jewels, and then seated in a covered carriage let them be driven to every village, town and royal city with an armed escort. And if any king shall be desirous of taking them into his harem, we will get up a fight with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king followed their advice. But the kings of the various countries, wherever they came, were afraid to let them enter their cities, but sent them presents and assigned them quarters outside the city walls. Thus they passed through the length and breadth of Jambudīpa till they reached Potali in the Assaka country. But Assaka too closed his gates against <span class="t18">[3.3] </span>them and merely sent them a present. Now this king had a wise and able minister named Nandisena, who had skill in means. He thought to himself, &ldquo;These princesses, men say, have traversed the length of Jambudīpa without finding any to fight for their possession. If this is the case, Jambudīpa is but an empty name. I myself will do battle with Kāliṅga.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then he went and bade the guards open the city gate to them, and spake the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Open the gate to these maidens: through Nandisena&rsquo;s might,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8139"></a><span class="t12">King Aruna&rsquo;s</span><a id="a8140"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15413"><span class="t19">{560}</span></a><span class="t12"> sage lion, our city is guarded aright.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.4}</span></p>
<p class="p6">With these words he threw open the gate, and brought the maidens into the presence of king Assaka, and said to him, &ldquo;Fear not. If there is to be a fight, I will see to it. Make these fair princesses your chief queens.&rdquo; Then he installed them as queens by sprinkling them with holy water, and dismissed their attendants, bidding them go and tell Kāliṅga that his daughters had been raised to the dignity of queen-consorts. So they went and told him, and Kāliṅga said: &ldquo;I presume he does not know how powerful I am,&rdquo; and at once he set out with a great army. Nandisena heard of his approach and sent a message to this effect, &ldquo;Let Kāliṅga abide within his own marches, and not encroach upon ours, and the battle shall be fought on the frontiers of the two countries.&rdquo; On receiving this message, Kāliṅga halted within the limits of his own territory and Assaka also kept to his.</p>
<p class="p7">At this time the Bodhisatta was following the ascetic life and was living in a hermitage on a spot lying between the two kingdoms. Said Kāliṅga, &ldquo;These monks are knowing fellows. Who can tell which of us will gain the victory, and which will be defeated. I will ask this ascetic.&rdquo; So he came to the Bodhisatta disguised, and sitting respectfully on one side, after the usual kindly greetings he said: &ldquo;Your reverence, Kāliṅga and Assaka have their forces drawn up each within his own territory, eager for a fight. Which of them will be victorious, and which will be defeated?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Venerable sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the one will conquer, the other will be beaten. I can tell you no more. But Sakka, the king of Heaven, is coming here. I will ask him and let you know, if you come back again tomorrow.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.5}</span></p>
<p class="p7">So when Sakka came to pay his respects to the Bodhisatta, he put this question to him, and Sakka replied, &ldquo;Respected sir, Kāliṅga will conquer, Assaka will be defeated, and such and such omens will be seen beforehand.&rdquo; Next day Kāliṅga came and repeated his question, and the Bodhisatta gave Sakka&rsquo;s answer. And Kāliṅga, without inquiring what <span class="t18">[3.4] </span>the omens would be, thought to himself, &ldquo;They tell me I shall conquer,&rdquo; and went away quite satisfied. This report spread abroad. And when Assaka heard it, he summoned Nandisena and said: &ldquo;Kāliṅga, they say, will be victorious and we shall be defeated. What is to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;who knows this? Do not trouble yourself as to who shall gain the victory and who shall suffer defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">With these words he comforted the king. Then he went and saluted the Bodhisatta, and sitting respectfully on one side he asked, &ldquo;Who, venerable sir, will conquer, and who will be defeated?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Kāliṅga,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;will win the day and Assaka will be beaten.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what, venerable sir,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;will be the omen for the one that conquers, and what for the one that is defeated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Venerable sir,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;the tutelary deity of the conqueror will be a spotless white bull, and that of the other king a perfectly black bull, and the tutelary gods of the two kings will themselves fight and be severally victorious or defeated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">On hearing this Nandisena rose up and went and took the king&rsquo;s allies &ndash; they were about one thousand in number and all of them great warriors &ndash; and led them up a mountain close at hand and asked them saying: &ldquo;Would you sacrifice your lives for our king?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yes, sir, we would,&rdquo; they answered.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Then throw yourselves from this precipice,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8141"></a>They attempted to do so, when he stopped them, saying: &ldquo;No more of this. Show yourselves staunch friends of our king and make a gallant fight for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">They all vowed to do so. And when the battle was now imminent, Kāliṅga came to the conclusion in his own mind that he would be victorious, and his army too thought: &ldquo;The victory will be ours.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.6}</span> And so they put on their armour, and forming themselves into separate detachments, they advanced just as they thought proper, and when the moment came for making a great effort, they failed to do so.</p>
<p class="p7">But both the kings, mounted on horseback, drew near to one another with the intention of fighting. And their two tutelary gods moved before them, that of Kāliṅga in the shape of a white bull, and that of the other king as a black bull. And as these drew near to one another, they too made every demonstration of fighting. But these two bulls were visible to the two kings only, and to no one else. And Nandisena asked Assaka, saying: &ldquo;Your Highness, are the tutelary gods visible to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;they are.&rdquo; &ldquo;In what guise?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The guardian god of Kāliṅga appears in the shape of a white bull, while ours is in the form of a black bull and looks distressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Fear not sire, we shall conquer and Kāliṅga will be defeated. Only <span class="t18">[3.5] </span>dismount from your well-trained Sindh horse, and grasping this spear, with your left hand give him a blow on the flank, and then with this body of a thousand men advance quickly and with a stroke of your weapon fell to the ground this god of Kāliṅga, while we with a thousand spears will smite him and so shall Kāliṅga&rsquo;s tutelary deity perish, and then shall Kāliṅga be defeated and we shall be victorious.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the king, and at a given signal from Nandisena he smote with his spear and his courtiers too smote with their thousand spears, and the tutelary god of Kāliṅga died then and there.</p>
<p class="p7">Meanwhile Kāliṅga was defeated and fled. And at the sight all those thousand councillors raised a loud cry, saying: &ldquo;Kāliṅga is fled.&rdquo; Then Kāliṅga with the fear of death upon him, as he fled, reproached that ascetic and uttered the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Kāliṅgas bold shall victory claim,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Defeat crowns Assakas with shame. </span><span class="t18">{3.7}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus did your reverence prophesy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And honest folk should never lie.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did Kāliṅga, as he fled, revile that ascetic. And in his flight to his own city he did not so much as once look back. And a few days afterwards Sakka came to visit the ascetic. And the ascetic conversing with him uttered the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;The gods from lying words are free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Truth should their chief treasure be.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In this, great Sakka, you did lie;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell me, I pray, the reason why.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, Sakka spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Have you, O brahmin, ne&rsquo;er been told</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gods envy not the hero bold?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The fixed resolve that may not yield,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Intrepid prowess in the field,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">High courage and adventurous might</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For Assaka have won the fight.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.8}</span></p>
<p class="p6">And on the flight of Kāliṅga, king Assaka returned with his spoils to his own city. And Nandisena sent a message to Kāliṅga, that he was to forward a portion for the dowry of these four royal maidens. &ldquo;Otherwise,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I shall know how to deal with him.&rdquo; And Kāliṅga, on hearing this message, was so alarmed that he sent a fitting portion for them. And from that day forward the two kings lived amicably together.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His discourse ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;In those days these young female ascetics were the daughters of king Kāliṅga, Sāriputta was Nandisena and I myself was the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Your gifts bestowed.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.6] </span><span class="t30">This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about the elder Ānanda. The circumstances that suggested the story have already been given.</span><a id="a8150"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15415"><span class="t9">{561}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana how elder Ānanda received a present of a thousand robes. The elder had been preaching to the ladies of the king of Kosala&rsquo;s palace as described above in the Mahāsārajātaka [Ja 92].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8151"></a><span class="t34">As he preached there in the manner described, a thousand robes, worth each a thousand pieces of money, were brought to the king. Of these the king gave five hundred to as many of his queens. The ladies put these aside and made them a present to our elder, and then the next day in their old ones went to the palace where the king took breakfast. The king remarked, &ldquo;I gave you dresses worth a thousand pieces each. Why are you not wearing them?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we have given them to the elder.&rdquo; &ldquo;Has elder Ānanda got them all?&rdquo; he asked. They said: &ldquo;Yes, he has.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Supreme Buddha,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;allows only three robes. Ānanda is doing a little trade in cloth, I suppose!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">He was angry with the elder; and after breakfast, visited him in his cell, and after greeting, sat down, with these words: &ldquo;Pray, sir, do my ladies learn or listen to your preaching?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Yes, sire; they learn what they ought, and what they ought to hear, they hear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Oh, indeed. Do they only listen, or do they make you presents of upper garments or under-garments?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Today, sire, they have given me five hundred robes worth a thousand pieces each.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;And you accepted them, sir?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Yes, sire, I did.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Why, sir, didn&rsquo;t the Teacher make some rule about three robes?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8152"></a><span class="t34">&ldquo;True, sire, for every monk three robes is the rule, speaking of what he uses for himself. But no one is forbidden to accept what is offered; and that is why I took them &ndash; to give them to monks whose robes are worn out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;But when these monks get them from you, what do they do with their old ones?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Make them into a cloak.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;And what about the old cloak?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;That they turn into a shirt.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;And the old shirt?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;That serves for a coverlet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;The old coverlet?&rdquo; &ldquo;Becomes a mat.&rdquo; &ldquo;The old mat?&rdquo; &ldquo;A towel.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what about the old towel?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Sire, it is not permitted to waste the gifts of the faithful; so they chop up the old towel into bits, and mix the bits with clay, which they use for mortar in building their houses.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;A gift, sir, ought not to be destroyed, not even a towel.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Well, sir king, we destroy no gifts, but all are used somehow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This conversation pleased the king so much, that he sent for the other five hundred robes which remained, and gave them to the elder. Then, after receiving his thanks, he greeted the elder in solemn state, and went his way.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The elder gave the first five hundred robes to monks whose robes were worn out. But the number of his fellow monastics was just five hundred. One of these, a young monk, was very useful to the elder; sweeping out his cell, serving him with food and drink, giving him toothbrush and water for cleansing his mouth, looking after the privies, living rooms, and sleeping rooms, and doing all that was needed for hand, foot, or back. To him, as his by right for all his great service, the elder gave all the five hundred robes which he had received afterwards. The young monk in his turn distributed them among his fellow-students. These all cut them up, dyed them yellow as a kaṇikāra flower; then dressed therein they waited upon the Teacher, greeted him, and sat down on one side.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8153"></a><span class="t34">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they asked, &ldquo;is it possible for a holy disciple who has entered on the First Path to be a respecter of persons in his gifts?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, monks, it is not possible for holy disciples to be respecters of persons in their gifts.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, our spiritual teacher, the Treasurer of the Dhamma, gave five hundred robes, each worth a thousand pieces, to a young monk; and he has divided them amongst us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monks, in giving these Ānanda was no respecter of persons. That young fellow was a very useful servant; so he made the present to his own attendant for the sake of his service, for goodness&rsquo; sake, and by right, thinking that one good turn deserves another, and with a wish to do what gratitude demands.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8154"></a><span class="t30">&ldquo;In former days too,&rdquo; the Teacher said, &ldquo;wise men acted on the principle that one good turn deserves another.&rdquo; And hereupon he told them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past the Bodhisatta was king of Benares, and exercising his rule with justice and equity he gave alms and kept the moral law.</p>
<p class="p7">And being minded to quell some disturbance on his frontier he set out with a large force, but being defeated he mounted his horse and fled till he reached a certain border village. Now there dwelt here thirty loyal subjects and they were gathered together very early, in the middle of the village, to transact the business of the place. And at this moment the king mounted on his mail-clad horse and splendidly equipped <span class="t18">{3.9}</span><a id="a8155"></a> rode into the place by the village gate. The people were terrified and saying: &ldquo;What can this be?&rdquo; fled every man to his own home. But there was one man who without going to his own house, came to welcome the king. And telling the stranger that the king, he heard, had come to the frontier, he inquired who he was and whether he was a royalist or a rebel. &ldquo;I am for the king, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then come with me,&rdquo; he answered, and led the king to his home and made him sit down on his own seat. Then the man said to his wife, &ldquo;My dear, bathe our friend&rsquo;s feet,&rdquo; and when she had done so, he offered him the best food he could, and had a bed made ready for him, bidding him rest awhile. So the king lay down. Then his host took off the armour from the horse, turned him loose, gave him water to drink and grass to eat and rubbed him down with oil. Thus did he tend the king for three or four days, and the king said: &ldquo;Friend, I am now off,&rdquo; and again he did all due service both to the king and his horse. The king after he had taken food, on leaving said: &ldquo;I am called the Great Horseman. Our home is in the centre of the city. Should you come there on any business, stand at the door on the right hand side and ask the porter where the Great Horseman dwells, and take him with you and come to our house.&rdquo; With these words he departed.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the army, not seeing the king, remained encamped outside the town, but when they saw him, they came out to meet him and escorted him home. The king on entering the city stood at the entrance of the <span class="t18">[3.7] </span>gate and calling the porter ordered the crowd to retire and said: &ldquo;Friend, a certain man who lives in a frontier village will come here, anxious to see us, and will ask where the house of the Great Horseman is. Take him by the hand and bring him into our presence, and then you shall receive a thousand pieces of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">But when the man failed to come, the king increased the tax on the village where he dwelt. But though the tax was raised, still he did not come. So the king increased the tax for the second and third time, and still he did not come. Then the inhabitants of the village gathered together and said to the man, &ldquo;Sir, from the time the Horseman came to you, <span class="t18">{3.10}</span> we have been so weighed down by the tax that we cannot lift up our heads. Go and see the Great Horseman and persuade him to lighten our burden.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, I will go,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I cannot go empty-handed. My friend has two sons: so get you ready ornaments and suits of clothes for them and for his wife and for my friend himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; they said, and got everything ready for a present.</p>
<p class="p7">So he took both this gift and a cake fried in his own house. And when he came to the door on the right hand side he asked the porter where the house of the Great Horseman might be. The porter answered, &ldquo;Come with me and I will show you,&rdquo; and took him by the hand, and on arriving at the king&rsquo;s gate sent in word, &ldquo;The porter has come and has brought with him the man who dwells in the border village.&rdquo; The king on hearing it, rose from his seat and said: &ldquo;Let my friend and all that have come with him enter.&rdquo; Then he went forward to welcome him and embraced him, and after inquiring if his friend&rsquo;s wife and children were well, he took him by the hand, stepped on the dais and seated him on the royal throne beneath the white umbrella. And he summoned his chief consort and said: &ldquo;Wash my friend&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo; So she washed his feet. The king sprinkled water from a golden bowl, while the queen washed his feet and anointed them with scented oil. Then the king asked, &ldquo;Have you anything for us to eat?&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; and brought out cakes in a bag. The king received them in a golden dish, and showing great favour towards him he said: &ldquo;Eat what my friend has brought,&rdquo; and gave some to his queen and his ministers, and himself too ate of it. Then the stranger brought out his other gift. And the king to show that he accepted it put off his silken garments and put on the suit of clothes that he had brought him. <span class="t18">{3.11}</span> The queen also laid aside her silk dress and ornaments and put on the dress and ornaments he had brought her. Then the king served him with food fit for a king and bade one of his councillors, saying: &ldquo;Go and see that his beard is trimmed after the fashion of my own, and let him bathe in scented water. Then dress him in a silken robe worth a hundred thousand pieces of money, and adorn him in royal style and bring him <span class="t18">[3.8] </span>here.&rdquo; This was done. And the king by beat of drum through the city gathered together his councillors, and throwing a thread of pure vermilion across the white umbrella, gave him half of his kingdom. From that day they ate, drank and dwelt together and they became firm and inseparable friends.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king sent for the man&rsquo;s wife and family and had a house built for them in the city, and they ruled the kingdom in perfect harmony. So the courtiers waxed angry and said to the king&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;O prince, the king has given half of his kingdom to a certain householder. He eats and drinks and dwells with him, and orders us to salute his children. What service he has done the king we know not. What does the king mean? We feel ashamed. Do speak to the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8156"></a>He readily agreed to do so, and told every word to the king and said: &ldquo;O great king, do not act thus.&rdquo; &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;do you know where I dwelt after I was defeated in battle?&rdquo;<a id="a8157"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15417"><span class="t9">{562}</span></a> &ldquo;I know not, my lord,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I was living,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;in this man&rsquo;s house, and when I had recovered my health I came back and reigned again. How then should I not bestow honour on my benefactor?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And then the Bodhisatta went on to say, &ldquo;My son, whosoever gives to one unworthy of his gift, and to the deserving gives nought, that man when he falls into misfortune finds no one to help him.&rdquo; And to point to the moral he uttered these verses: <span class="t18">{3.12}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Your gifts bestowed upon or fool or cheat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In sorest need would bring no friend to save:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. But grace or kindness to the good displayed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In sorest need would bring you timely aid.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Boons to unworthy souls are spent in vain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your smallest service to the good is gain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. A noble action though it stands alone,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Renders the doer worthy of a throne:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As fruit abundant from the tiny seed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eternal fame springs from a virtuous deed.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.13}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this neither the councillors nor the young prince had anything to say in answer.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his discourse ended, thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time it was Ānanda who dwelt in the frontier village, while I myself was king of Benares.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;O monarch that once.&rdquo;</span><span class="t34"> </span><span class="t18">[3.9] </span><a id="a8166"></a><a id="a8167"></a><a id="a8168"></a><span class="t30">This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about a courtier of the king of Kosala. The circumstances that suggested the story have already been related in the Seyyaṁsajātaka [Ja 282].</span><a id="a8169"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15419"><span class="t9">{563}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This tale the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a courtier of the king of Kosala. This man was very useful to the king, we are told, and did everything that had to be done. Because he was very useful, the king did him great honour. The others were jealous, and concocted a slander, and calumniated him. The king believed their saying, and without enquiring into his guilt, bound him in chains, though virtuous and innocent, and cast him into prison. There he dwelt all alone; but, by reason of his virtue, he had peace of mind, and with mind at peace he understood the conditions of existence, and attained the fruition of the First Path. By and by the king found that he was guiltless, and broke his chains and gave him honour more than before.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The man wished to pay his respects to the Teacher; and taking flowers and perfumes, he went to the monastery, and did reverence to the Tathāgata, and sat respectfully aside. The Teacher talked graciously with him. &ldquo;We have heard that ill fortune befell you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Yes, sir, but I made my ill fortune into good; and as I sat in prison, I produced the fruition of the First Path.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On this occasion the Teacher said: &ldquo;You are not the only one who got good out of evil: wise men of old also got good out of evil.&rdquo; And he told a story about the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8170"></a>In the past a minister in attendance on the king of Benares misconducted himself in the royal harem. The king after witnessing his offence with his own eyes banished him from the kingdom. How he took service with the king of Kosala, named Dabbasena, is all told in the Mahāsīlavajātaka [Ja 51].</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8171"></a><span class="t11">Now one of the king&rsquo;s ministers had dealt treacherously in the king&rsquo;s harem, and this became matter of common talk. The ministers reported it to the king. Examining into the matter himself, the king found the minister&rsquo;s guilt to be clear. So he sent for the culprit, and said: &ldquo;O blinded by folly! You have sinned, and are not worthy to dwell in my kingdom; take your substance and your wife and family, and go hence.&rdquo; Driven thus from the realm, that minister left the Kāsi country, and, entering the service of the king of Kosala, gradually rose to be that monarch&rsquo;s confidential adviser. One day he said to the king of Kosala, &ldquo;Sire, the kingdom of Benares is like a goodly honeycomb untainted by flies; its king is feebleness itself; and a trifling force would suffice to conquer the whole country.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Hereon, the king of Kosala reflected that the kingdom of Benares was large, and, considering this in connection with the advice that a trifling force could conquer it, he grew suspicious that his adviser was a hireling instigated to lead him into a trap. &ldquo;Traitor,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you are paid to say this!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Indeed I am not,&rdquo; answered the other, &ldquo;I do but speak the truth. If you doubt me, send men to massacre a village over his border, and see whether, when they are caught and brought before him, the king does not let them off scot-free and even load them with gifts.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;He shows a very bold front in making his assertion,&rdquo; thought the king, &ldquo;I will test his counsel without delay.&rdquo; And accordingly he sent some of his creatures to harry a village across the Benares border. The ruffians were captured and brought before the king of Benares, who asked them, saying: &ldquo;My children, why have you killed my villagers?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Because we could not make a living,&rdquo; said they.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Then why did you not come to me?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;See that you do not do the like again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">And he gave them presents and sent them away. Back they went and told this to the king of Kosala. But this evidence was not enough to nerve him to the expedition; and a second band was sent to massacre another village, this time in the heart of the kingdom. These too were likewise sent away with presents by the king of Benares. But even this evidence was not deemed strong enough; and a third party was sent to plunder the very streets of Benares! And these, like their forerunners, were sent away with presents! Satisfied at last that the king of Benares was an entirely good king, the king of Kosala resolved to seize on his kingdom, and set out against him with troops and elephants.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now in these days the king of Benares had a thousand gallant warriors, who would face the charge even of a rut elephant &ndash; whom the launched thunderbolt of Sakka could not terrify &ndash; a matchless band of invincible heroes ready at the king&rsquo;s command to reduce all Jambudīpa to his sway! These, hearing the king of Kosala was coming to take Benares, came to their sovereign with the news, and prayed that they might be dispatched against the invader. &ldquo;We will defeat and capture him, sire,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;before he can set foot over the border.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Not so, my children,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;None shall suffer because of me. Let those who covet kingdoms seize mine, if they will.&rdquo; And he refused to allow them to march against the invader.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Then the king of Kosala crossed the border and came to the middle-country; and again the ministers went to the king with renewed entreaty. But still the king refused. And now the king of Kosala appeared outside the city, and sent a message to the king bidding him either yield up the kingdom or give battle. &ldquo;I fight not,&rdquo; was the message of the king of Benares in reply, &ldquo;let him seize my kingdom.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Yet a third time the king&rsquo;s ministers came to him and besought him not to allow the king of Kosala to enter, but to permit them to overthrow and capture him before the city. Still refusing, the king bade the city-gates be opened, and seated himself in state aloft upon his royal throne with his thousand ministers round him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8172"></a>But in the present story Dabbasena had the king of Benares seized while sitting on the dais in the midst of his councillors, and fastening him by a cord on the lintel of the door suspended him head downwards. The king cultivated feelings of generosity towards the rebel prince, and by a process of focusing on the Meditation Object entered upon a state of Absorption, and bursting his bonds sat cross-legged in the air. The rebel prince was attacked with a burning pain in the body, and with a cry of, &ldquo;I burn, I burn,&rdquo; he rolled over and over on the ground. When he asked the reason of it, his courtiers replied, &ldquo;It is because the king whom you suspend head downwards from the lintel of the door is such an innocent and holy man.&rdquo; Then said he, &ldquo;Go quickly and release him.&rdquo; His servants went and found the king sitting cross-legged in the air, and came back and told Dabbasena. <span class="t18">{3.14}</span> So he went with all speed, and bowing before him asked his pardon and repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8173"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;O monarch that once in your kingdom did dwell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Enjoying such bliss as few mortals have seen,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How is it that lying midst tortures of hell</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You still are so calm and so gracious of mien?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the Bodhisatta repeated the rest of the verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Of yore &rsquo;twas my one earnest prayer unto heaven</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From the ranks of ascetics no more to be barred,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But now that such glory to me has been given,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O why should the form of my visage be marred? </span><span class="t18">[3.10]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. The end is accomplished, my task is now done,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The prince once my foe is no longer estranged,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But now that the fame I so envied is won,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O why should the form of my visage be changed?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8174"></a><span class="t12">4. When</span><a id="a8175"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15421"><span class="t19">{564}</span></a><span class="t12"> joy turns to sorrow, and weal becomes woe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Patient souls even pleasure may wring from their pain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But no such distinction of feeling they know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When the calm of Nibbāna poor mortals attain.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.15}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this Dabbasena asked forgiveness of the Bodhisatta and said: &ldquo;Rule over your own people and I will drive out the rebels from amongst you.&rdquo; And after punishing that wicked councillor he went his way. But the Bodhisatta handed over the kingdom to his ministers, and adopting the ascetic life of a seer he became destined to birth in the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had finished this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was Dabbasena, and I myself was the king of Benares.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;O Daddara, who.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8182"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about a certain choleric fellow. The circumstance has already been related before.</span><a id="a8183"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15423"><span class="t9">{565}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8184"></a><span class="t30">On this occasion when a discussion had arisen in the Dhamma Hall about the passionate nature of the man, the Teacher came up, and when in answer to his inquiry he was told by the monks the subject of their discourse, he sent for the man and asked, &ldquo;Is it true, monk, what they say, that you are passionate?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, my lord, it is so,&rdquo; he replied. </span><span class="t18">{3.16}</span><span class="t30"> Then the Teacher said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but of old too this fellow was very choleric, and </span><span class="t18">[3.11] </span><span class="t30">owing to his passionate temper wise men of former days though continuing to lead perfectly innocent lives as Nāga princes, had to dwell three years on a filthy dunghill.&rdquo; And herewith he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8185"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning at Benares, the Daddara Nāgas dwelt at the foot of Mount Daddara in the Himālayas region and the Bodhisatta came to life as Mahādaddara [Great Daddara], the son of Sūradaddara [Hero Daddara], the king of that country, with a younger brother named Culladaddara [Little Daddara]. The latter was passionate and cruel, and went about abusing and striking the Nāga maidens. The Nāga king, on hearing of his cruelty, gave orders for his expulsion from the Nāga world. But Mahādaddara got his father to forgive him and saved his brother from expulsion. A second time the king was angry with him, and again he was induced to forgive him. But on the third occasion the king said: &ldquo;You have prevented me from expelling this good-for-nothing fellow; now both of you get you gone from this Nāga world, and live for three years at Benares on a dunghill.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So he drove them forth from the Nāga country and they went and lived at Benares. And when the village boys saw them looking for their food in a ditch bounding the dunghill, they struck them and threw clods and sticks and other missiles at them, and crying out, &ldquo;What have we here &ndash; water lizards with big heads and tails like needles?&rdquo; uttered other words of abuse. But Culladaddara, by reason of his fierce and passionate nature, being unable to put up with such disrespect said: &ldquo;Brother, these boys are mocking us. They don&rsquo;t know that we are venomous serpents. I can&rsquo;t stand their contempt for us. I will destroy them by the breath of my nostril.&rdquo; And then addressing his brother, he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;O Daddara, who such an insult could bear?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Ho! Frog-eating stick-i&rsquo;-the-mud,&rsquo; they cry:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To think that these poor harmless creatures should dare</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A serpent with poisonous fang to defy!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.17}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing his words Mahādaddara uttered the rest of the verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;An exile driven to a foreign shore</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Must of abuse lay up a goodly store.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. For where his rank and virtues none can know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Only the fool his pride would care to show.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. He who at home a shining light may be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Abroad must suffer men of low degree.</span></p>
<p class="p6">So they dwelt there three years. Then their father recalled them home. And from that day their pride was abated. <span class="t18">[3.12]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had brought his discourse to an end, he proclaimed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the choleric monk attained Fruition of the Third Path. &ldquo;At that time the choleric monk was Culladaddara, and I myself was Mahādaddara.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Five hundred monks living in Jetavana, at the close of the middle watch of the night, entered into an argument on the pleasures of sense. Now the Teacher through all the six divisions of night and day keeps a continual watch over the monks, even as a one-eyed man carefully guards his eye, a father his only son, or a yak its tail. In the night time, with his supernatural vision regarding Jetavana, he beheld these monks, as it were, like robbers that had found their way into some great king&rsquo;s palace. And opening his perfumed chamber he summoned Ānanda and bade him assemble the monks in the part that Anāthapiṇḍika paved with gold pieces laid side by side,</span><a id="a8200"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15428"><span class="t9">{567}</span></a><span class="t30"> and prepare a seat for him at the door of the perfumed chamber. Ānanda did as he was commanded and told the Teacher. Then the Teacher, sitting down on the seat prepared for him, addressed the monks collectively and said: &ldquo;Monks, wise men of old thought there was no such thing as secrecy in wrong-doing and so refrained from it,&rdquo; and he told them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life in a brahmin family, and when he was of age, he was taught science by a world-renowned teacher of that city, being at the head of a class of five hundred students. Now his teacher had a grown-up daughter. And he thought: &ldquo;I will test the virtue of these youths and will give her in marriage to him that most excels in virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So one day he thus addressed his pupils, &ldquo;My friends, I have a grown-up daughter, and I intend to give her in marriage, but I must have proper dresses and ornaments for her. Do steal some without your friends discovering it, and bring them to me. Whatever no one has seen you take I will accept, but if you allow anything you bring to be seen, I shall refuse it.&rdquo; They agreed, saying: &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and from that day they stole dresses and ornaments without their friends&rsquo; knowledge <span class="t18">[3.13] </span>and brought them to him. And the teacher arranged whatever each pupil brought in a separate place. But the Bodhisatta stole nothing.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the teacher said, <span class="t18">{3.19}</span> &ldquo;But you, my friend, bring me nothing.&rdquo; &ldquo;True, Teacher,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Why is this, my friend?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You accept nothing,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;unless it is taken secretly. But I find there is no such thing as secrecy in wrong-doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And to illustrate this truth he repeated these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;In truth there is no act of wrong, that in this world may hidden lie,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That which the fool a secret deems, the spirits of the wood espy.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Concealment nowhere may be found, nor can a void exist for me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">E&rsquo;en where no being is in sight, while I am there, no void can be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Teacher, being pleased with his words, said: &ldquo;Friend, there is no lack of wealth in my house, but I was anxious to marry my daughter to a virtuous man, and I acted thus to prove these youths. But you alone are worthy of my daughter.&rdquo; Then he adorned his daughter and gave her in marriage to the Bodhisatta, but to his other pupils he said: &ldquo;Take back all that you brought me to your several homes again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the Teacher said: &ldquo;It was thus, monks, that the wicked pupils by their dishonesty failed to win this woman, while this one wise youth by his virtuous conduct obtained her as his wife.&rdquo; And after Fully Awakening he gave utterance to yet two other verses:<span class="t9"> </span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8202"></a><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;</span><span class="t12">Dujjacca,</span><a id="a8203"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15430"><span class="t19">{568}</span></a><a id="a8204"></a><span class="t12"> Sujacca, Nando and Sukhavaḍḍhita</span><span class="t12">,</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having brought this solemn lesson to an end, declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths these five hundred monks became an Arahat, &ldquo;At that time Sāriputta was the Teacher, and I myself was the wise youth.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present when the king of Kosala and his queen have a falling out the Buddha reconciles them.

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;What is this egg-shaped fruit.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8216"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while dwelling at Jetavana, about queen Mallikā. One day, they say, there was a dispute at court between her and the king.</span><a id="a8217"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15432"><span class="t9">{569}</span></a><span class="t30"> The king was so enraged that he </span><span class="t18">[3.14] </span><span class="t30">ignored her existence. Mallikā thought: &ldquo;The Teacher, I fancy, knows not how angry the king is with me.&rdquo; But the Teacher knew all about it and resolved to make peace between them. So early in the morning he put on his inner garment and taking his bowl and robes he entered Sāvatthi with a following of five hundred monks and came to the palace gate. The king took his bowl from the Tathāgata, brought him into the house, and placing him on the seat prepared for him, poured the Water of Donation on the hands of the Saṅgha with Buddha at their head, and brought them rice and cakes to eat. But the Teacher covered up his bowl with his hand and said: &ldquo;Sire, where is the queen?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;What have you to do with her, venerable sir?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Her head is turned, she is intoxicated with the honour she enjoys.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;after you yourself bestowed this honour on the woman, it is wrong of you now to get rid of her, and not to put up with the offence she has committed against you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The king hearkened to the words of the Teacher and sent for the queen. </span><span class="t18">{3.21}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">And she ministered to the Teacher. &ldquo;You ought,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to live together in peace,&rdquo; and singing the praises of the sweets of concord he went his way. And from that day they lived happily together.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, how that the Teacher had reconciled the king and queen by a single word. The Teacher, when he came, inquired what the monks were discussing, and on being told said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but formerly too I reconciled them by a single word of admonition.&rdquo; And he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was king at Benares, the Bodhisatta was his minister and his temporal and spiritual adviser.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8218"></a>Now one day the king stood at an open window looking into the palace court. And at this very moment the daughter of a fruit seller, a beautiful girl in the flower of her youth, stood with a basket of jujubes on her head crying, &ldquo;Jujubes, ripe jujubes, who&rsquo;ll buy my jujubes?&rdquo; But she did not venture into the royal court.<a id="a8219"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15434"><span class="t9">{570}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">And the king no sooner heard her voice than he fell in love with her, and when he learned that she was unmarried he sent for her and raised her to the dignity of chief queen, and bestowed great honour upon her. Now she was dear and pleasing in the king&rsquo;s eyes. And one day the king sat eating jujubes in a golden dish. And the queen Sujātā, when she saw the king eating jujubes, asked him, saying: &ldquo;My lord, what in the world are you eating? &ldquo;And she uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;What is this egg-shaped fruit, my lord, so pretty and red of hue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In a gold dish set before you? Pray tell me, where they grew.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And the king was angry and said: &ldquo;O daughter of a greengrocer, dealer in ripe jujubes, do you not recognise the jujubes, the special fruit of your own family?&rdquo; And he repeated two verses: <span class="t18">{3.22}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Bare-headed and meanly clad, my queen, you once did feel no shame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To fill your lap with the jujube fruit, and now you do ask its name;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. You are eaten up with pride, my queen, you findest no pleasure in life,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Begone and gather your jujubes again. You shall be no longer my wife.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.15]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta thought: &ldquo;No one, except myself, will be able to reconcile this pair. I will appease the king&rsquo;s anger and prevent him from turning her out of doors.&rdquo; Then he repeated the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;These are the wrongs of a woman, my lord, promoted to high estate:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Forgive her and cease from thine anger, O king, for &rsquo;twas you did make her great.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So the king at his word put up with the offence of the queen and restored her to her former position. And thenceforth they lived amicably together.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8220"></a><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the king of Kosala was king of Benares, Mallikā was Sujātā and I myself was the minister.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a8227"></a><a id="a8228"></a><span class="t15">In the present when Ven. Ānanda realises the Buddha is passing away he grieves as he still had not accomplished his purpose. The Buddha said he would soon succeed, and told a story of the past where a brahmin had worshipped a tree devoutly, and the Devatā of the tree had dug up a treasure for his devotee.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the Tree Devatā (Rukkhadevatā),</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a8229"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Devotion, Attainment, Devas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Why, brahmin, though.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {3.23}</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher, when he lay down to enter Parinbbāna, told this story of the elder Ānanda.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8230"></a><span class="t30">The venerable monk, knowing that the Teacher on this very night at eventide would pass away, said to himself, &ldquo;I am still under discipline and have duties to perform, and my Teacher is certainly going to pass away, and then the service I have rendered to him for five-and-twenty years will be fruitless.&rdquo; And so being overwhelmed with sorrow he leaned upon the monkey-head which formed the bolt of the garden store-room and burst into tears.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">And the Teacher, missing Ānanda, asked the monks where he was, and on hearing what was the matter he sent for him and addressed him as follows, &ldquo;Ānanda, you have laid up a store of merit. Continue to strive earnestly and you will soon be free from human passion. Grieve not thyself. Wherefore should the service you have rendered me prove fruitless now, seeing that your former services in the days of your sinfulness were not without their reward?&rdquo; Then he told a legend of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8231"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life in the form of a Flame of the Forest Devatā. Now at this time all the inhabitants of Benares were devoted to the worship of such deities, and constantly engaged in offerings and the like. <span class="t18">[3.16]</span></p>
<p class="p7">And a certain poor brahmin thought: &ldquo;I too will watch over some divinity.&rdquo; So he found a big Flame of the Forest growing on high ground, and by sprinkling gravel and sweeping all round it, he kept its root smooth and free from grass. Then he presented it with a scented wreath of five sprays and lighting a lamp made an offering of flowers and perfume and incense. And after a reverential salutation he said: &ldquo;Peace be with you,&rdquo; and then went his way. On the next day he came quite early and asked after its welfare. Now one day it occurred to the Tree Devatā, &ldquo;This brahmin is very attentive to me. I will test him and find out why he thus worships me, and grant him his desire.&rdquo; So when the brahmin came and was sweeping about the root of the tree, the spirit stood near him disguised as an aged brahmin and repeated the first verse: <span class="t18">{3.24}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Why, brahmin, though thyself with reason blessed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Have you this dull insensate tree addressed?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vain is your prayer, your kindly greeting vain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From this dull wood no answer will you gain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the brahmin replied in a second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Long on this spot a famous tree has stood,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Meet dwelling-place for spirits of the wood;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With deepest awe such beings I revere,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They guard, I think, some sacred treasure here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Tree Devatā on hearing these words was so pleased with the brahmin that he said: &ldquo;O brahmin, I was born as the divinity of this tree. Fear not. I will grant you this treasure.&rdquo; And to reassure him, by a great manifestation of divine power, he stood suspended in the air at the entrance of his celestial mansion, while he recited two more verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;O brahmin, I have marked your act of love;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A pious deed can never fruitless prove.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Lo! Where that fig tree casts its ample shade,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Due sacrifice and gifts of old were paid.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Beneath this fig a buried treasure lies,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The gold unearth, and claim it as your prize.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.25}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The spirit moreover added these words, &ldquo;O brahmin, you would be weary, if you had to dig up the treasure and carry it away with you. Do you therefore go your way, and I will bring it to your house and deposit it in such and such a place. Then do you enjoy it all your life long, and give alms and keep the precepts.&rdquo; And after thus admonishing the brahmin, the Tree Devatā, by an exercise of divine power, conveyed the treasure into the brahmin&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher here brought his lesson to an end and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the brahmin, and I myself was the Tree Devatā.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a woodpecker in the Himālayas. <span class="t18">{3.26}</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now a certain lion, while devouring his prey, had a bone stick in his throat. His throat swelled up so that he could not take any food and severe pains set in. Then this woodpecker, while intent on seeking its own food, as it was perched on a bough, saw the lion and asked him, saying: &ldquo;Friend, what ails you?&rdquo; He told him what was the matter, and the bird said: &ldquo;I would take the bone out of your throat, friend, but I dare not put my head into your mouth, for fear you should eat me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Do not be afraid, friend; I will not eat you up. Only save my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the bird, and ordered the lion to lie down upon his side. Then it thought: &ldquo;Who knows what this fellow will be about?&rdquo; And to prevent his closing his mouth, it fixed a stick between his upper and lower jaw, and then putting its head into the lion&rsquo;s mouth, it struck the end of the bone with its beak. The bone fell out and disappeared. And then the woodpecker drew out its head from the lion&rsquo;s mouth, and with a blow from its beak knocked out the stick, and hopping off sat on the top of a bough.</p>
<p class="p7">The lion recovered from his sickness, and one day was devouring a wild buffalo which he had killed. Thought the woodpecker, &ldquo;I will now put him to the test,&rdquo; and perching on a bough above the lion&rsquo;s head, it fell to conversing with him and uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Kindness as much as in us lay,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a8254"></a><span class="t30">The Teacher sent for the six monks and asked if it were true that they taught the Dhamma from a low seat,</span><a id="a8255"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15440"><span class="t9">{573}</span></a><span class="t30"> while their pupils sat on a higher seat. They confessed that it was so, and the Teacher in reproving these monks for their want of respect for his Dhamma, said that wise men of old had to rebuke men for teaching even heretical doctrines while sitting on a low seat. Then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as the son of a pariah woman, and when he was grown up, he established himself as a householder. And his wife being with child had a great longing for the mango fruit, and said to her husband, &ldquo;My lord, I have a desire to eat mangoes.&rdquo; <span class="t18">[3.19]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8256"></a>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there are no mangoes at this season, I will bring you some other acid fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if I can have a mango, I shall live. Otherwise I shall die.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.28}</span></p>
<p class="p7">He being infatuated about his wife thought: &ldquo;Where in the world am I to get a mango?&rdquo; Now at this time there was a mango tree in the garden of the king of Benares, which had fruit on it all the year round. So he thought: &ldquo;I will get a ripe mango there to appease her longings.&rdquo; And going to the garden by night he climbed up the tree, and stepped from one branch to another, looking for the fruit, and while he was thus engaged, the day began to break. He thought: &ldquo;If I shall come down now to go away, I shall be seen and seized as a thief. I will wait till it is dark.&rdquo; So he climbed up into a fork of the tree and remained there, perched upon it.</p>
<p class="p7">Now at this time the king of Benares was being taught sacred texts by his family priest. And coming into the garden he sat down on a high seat at the foot of the mango tree, and placing his teacher on a lower seat, he had a lesson from him. The Bodhisatta sitting above them thought: &ldquo;How wicked this king is. He is learning the sacred texts, sitting on a high seat. The brahmin too is equally wicked, to sit and teach him from a lower seat. I also am wicked, for I have fallen into the power of a woman, and counting my life as nought, I am stealing a mango fruit.&rdquo; Then taking hold of a hanging bough, he let himself down from the tree, and stood before these two men and said: &ldquo;O Great king, I am a lost man, and you a gross fool, and this priest is as one dead.&rdquo; And being asked by the king what he meant by these words, he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Holy Teacher, Royal Scholar, lo! the sinful deed I saw,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a8257"></a><span class="t12">Both alike from grace are fallen, both alike transgressed Dhamma.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8258"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15442"><span class="t19">{574}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{3.29}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The brahmin, on hearing this, repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;My food is pure rice from the hill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With a delicate flavour of meat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For why should a sinner fulfil</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A rule meant for saints, when they eat?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the Bodhisatta recited two more verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Brahmin, go range the length and breadth of earth;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lo! Suffering is found the common lot.</span></p>

But henceforth I will be king by day, and you shall be king by night.&rdquo; And with these words he placed upon his neck the wreath of flowers with which he himself was adorned, and made him lord protector over the city. And hence is derived the custom for the lords of the city to wear a wreath of red flowers on their neck. And from that day forward the king abiding in his admonition paid respect to his teacher, and learned sacred texts from him, sitting on a lower seat.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, his lesson ended, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the king, and I myself was the outcaste.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is discontent with his life. When the Buddha hears about it he tells him a story about two friends. After their education one was raised to be king, but the other went into the forests to become an ascetic. When the king sent for him to be his family priest, he refused despite the honour, as he would then be a party to the oppression of others.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;No throne on earth.&rdquo;</span><a id="a8269"></a><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this story while in residence at Jetavana, about a discontented monk, who in going his rounds for alms at Sāvatthi caught sight of a beautiful woman, and thenceforth had grown discontented and lost all pleasure in the dispensation. So the monks brought him before the Fortunate One. Said the Fortunate One, &ldquo;Is it true, monk, what I hear, that you are discontented?&rdquo; He confessed it was so. The Teacher on learning the cause of his discontent said: &ldquo;Why, monk, are you longing for the world, after taking ordination in a dispensation that leads to safety? Wise men of old when offered the dignity of being a family priest rejected it, and adopted the ascetic life.&rdquo; And he told them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was conceived in the womb of the brahmin wife of the king&rsquo;s family priest, <span class="t18">{3.31}</span> and was born on the same day as the king&rsquo;s son. And when the king asked his ministers if any child had been born on the same day as his son, they said: &ldquo;Yes, sire, a son of your family priest.&rdquo; So the king had him brought and given into the charge of nurses to be carefully tended together with the young prince. And they both had the same ornaments to wear and had exactly the same things to eat and drink.<span class="t18"> [3.21]</span></p>
<p class="p7">And when they were grown up, they went together to Taxila and as soon as they had attained proficiency in all the sciences they returned home.</p>
<p class="p7">The king made his son viceroy and bestowed great honour upon him. From that time the Bodhisatta ate, drank, and lived with the prince, and there was a firm friendship between them. By and by at the death of his father, the young prince ascended the throne and enjoyed great prosperity. Thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;My friend now rules the kingdom; when he sees a fitting opportunity, he will certainly give me the office of his family priest. What have I to do with a householder&rsquo;s life? I will become an ascetic and devote myself to solitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So he saluted his parents and having asked their permission to take ordination, he gave up his worldly fortune and setting forth quite alone he entered the Himālayas. There on a charming spot he built himself a hermitage, and adopting the ascetic life he developed the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and lived in the enjoyment of the pleasure of the Absorptions.</p>
<p class="p7">At this time the king remembered him and said: &ldquo;What has become of my friend? He is nowhere to be seen.&rdquo; His ministers told him he had taken ordination, and was living, they heard, in some delightful grove. The king asked the place of his abode, and said to a councillor named Sayha, &ldquo;Go and bring my friend back with you. I will make him my family priest.&rdquo; Sayha readily assented, and going forth from Benares in course of time reached a frontier village and taking up his abode there, he went with some foresters to the place where the Bodhisatta dwelt and found him sitting like a golden statue at the door of his hut. After saluting him with the usual compliments he sat at a respectful distance and thus addressed him, &ldquo;Venerable sir, the king desires your return, being anxious to raise you to the dignity of his family priest.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.32}</span><a id="a8270"></a> The Bodhisatta replied, &ldquo;If I were to receive not merely the post of family priest but all of Kāsi and Kosala, and the realm of Jambudīpa and the glory of a Universal Empire, I would refuse to go. The wise do not again take up the defilements they have once abandoned any more than they would swallow the phlegm they have once spat out.&rdquo; So saying he repeated these verses:<a id="a8271"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15444"><span class="t9">{575}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;No throne on earth should tempt me to my shame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No sea-girt realm, safe-guarded in the deep.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Accurséd be the lust of wealth and fame</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That dooms poor man in suffering worlds to weep.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Better through earth a homeless waif to stray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And bowl in hand to beg from door to door.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To bear a tyrant rule and vex the poor.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.22]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Bodhisatta though again and again importuned by him reject his offer. And Sayha, being unable to prevail on him, saluted him, and returned and told the king of his refusal to come. <span class="t18">{3.33}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8272"></a><span class="t30">When the Teacher had brought his lesson to an end, he revealed the Truths and identified the Jātaka. At the conclusion of the Truths the discontented monk attained to fruition of the First Path. Many others too experienced like fruits of various Attainments, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the king, Sāriputta was Sayha, and I myself was the family priest.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present when a thief lies down on Ven. Moggallāna&rsquo;s porch he chases him off as his pursuers arrive. The Buddha tells a story of how a neem Tree Devatā chased off a thief fearing his branch would be cut down to impale the thief on, and the dialogue that ensues.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the margosa Tree Devatā (Nimbadevatā),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Robber, arise.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher, while dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, told this story about the venerable Moggallāna.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When that elder was living near Rājagaha in a forest hut, a certain robber, after breaking into a house in a suburban village, fled with his hands full of plunder till he came within the precincts of the elder&rsquo;s cell, and thinking that he should be safe there he lay down at the entrance of his hut of leaves. The elder noticed him lying there and suspecting his character said to himself, &ldquo;It would be wrong for me to have any dealings with a robber.&rdquo; So coming out of his hut he told him not to lie there, and drove him away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The robber starting off fled with the greatest haste. And men with torches in their hands, following close upon the robber&rsquo;s track, came and saw the various spots marked by the presence of the robber and said: &ldquo;It was this way the robber came. Here is where he stood. There he sat down. And that is the way he fled. He is not to be seen here.&rdquo; So they rushed about here and there, but at last had to return without finding him. On the next day early in the morning the elder went his round for alms in Rājagaha, and on coming back from his rounds he went to the Bamboo Grove and told the Teacher what had happened. The Teacher said: &ldquo;You are not the only one, Moggallāna, to suspect in a case in which suspicion is justified. Wise men of old suspected in like manner.&rdquo; And at the request of the elder he told a story of bygone times. </span><span class="t18">{3.34}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a Nimb tree spirit in a cemetery grove of that city. Now one day a robber having been guilty of an act of theft in an outlying hamlet of the city entered the cemetery grove. And at this time two old trees stood there, a Nimb tree and a Bodhi tree. The robber placed his stolen goods at the foot of this Nimb tree and lay down there.<span class="t18"> [3.23]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now in these days robbers that were caught were put to torture by being impaled on a stake of the Nimb tree. So the spirit of the Nimb tree thought: &ldquo;If people should come and capture this robber, they will cut off a branch and make a stake from this Nimb tree and impale him on it. And in that case the tree will be destroyed. So I will drive the fellow away.&rdquo; Then addressing him, he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Robber, arise! Why sleepest you? For slumber &rsquo;tis no time,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The king&rsquo;s men are upon you, the avengers of your crime.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Moreover he added these words, &ldquo;Get you gone, before the king&rsquo;s men take you.&rdquo; Thus did he frighten the robber away. And no sooner had he fled than the deity of the Bodhi tree repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;And even if this robber bold red-handed they should take,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To you, O Nimb tree, woodland Devatā, what difference would it make?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The deity of the Nimb tree on hearing this uttered the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;O Bodhi tree, sure you knowest not the secret of my fear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I would not have the king&rsquo;s men find that wicked robber here.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They from my sacred tree, I know, straightway a branch would take,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And to requite the guilty wretch, impale him on a stake.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.35}</span></p>
<p class="p6">And while the two sylvan deities were thus conversing together, the owners of the property, following on the trail of the robber, with torches in their hand, when they saw the place where he had been lying down said: &ldquo;Lo! The robber has just risen up and fled from this place. We have not got him yet, but if we do, we will come back and either impale him at the foot of this Nimb tree, or hang him from one of its branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And with these words rushing about here and there, and not finding the robber, they made off. And on hearing what they said the spirit of the Bodhi tree uttered the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Beware a danger yet unseen: suspect before too late,</span></p>

A young nobleman at Sāvatthi, tradition says, from a sense of the evil consequences of wicked desires received ordination at the hands of the Teacher, and by devotion to the practice by which Absorption may be induced, in no long time became an Arahat. By and by on the death of his mother, he admitted his father and younger brother to orders, and they took up their abode at Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a8287"></a><span class="t30">At the opening of the rainy season, hearing of a village retreat where the necessary robes were to be easily obtained,</span><a id="a8288"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15446"><span class="t9">{576}</span></a><a id="a8289"></a><span class="t30"> they all three entered upon the rains residence there, and when it was ended they returned straight to Jetavana. The youthful monk, when they came to a spot not far from Jetavana, told the novice lad to bring on the old man quietly, while he himself pushed on ahead to Jetavana to get ready their cell. The old monk walked slowly on. The novice repeatedly butted him, as it were, with his head, and dragged him along by force, crying, &ldquo;Come on, Teacher.&rdquo; The elder said: &ldquo;You are pulling me along against my will,&rdquo; and turning back he made a fresh start from the beginning. As they were thus quarrelling, the sun went down and darkness set in.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The young monk meanwhile swept out his hut, set water in the pots, and not seeing them coming, he took a torch and went to meet them. When he saw them coming, he asked what made them so late. The old man gave the reason. So he made them rest and brought them slowly on their way. That day he found no time to pay his respects to the Buddha. So on the next day, when he had come to pay his respects to Buddha, after he had saluted him and taken his seat, the Teacher asked, &ldquo;When did you arrive?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yesterday, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;You came yesterday and pay your respects to me only today?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he answered, and told him the reason. The Teacher rebuked the elder, &ldquo;Not only now does he act like this. Of old too he did just the same. Now it is you that are annoyed by him. Formerly he annoyed wise men.&rdquo; And at the monk&rsquo;s request he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life in a brahmin family in a town of the Kāsi country. <span class="t18">{3.37}</span> When he was grown up, his mother died. And after due performance of her funeral rites, at the end of six weeks he gave away in alms all the money that was in the house, and taking his father and younger brother with him he put on the bark garment of somebody or other, and adopted the ascetic life in the Himālayas. And there he dwelt in a pleasant grove, supporting himself by gleaning in the fields and living on roots and wild fruits. <span class="t18">[3.25]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now in the Himālayas, during the rainy season, when the rains are incessant, as it is impossible to dig up any bulb or root, or to get any wild fruits, and the leaves begin to fall, the ascetics for the most part come down, and take up their abode amidst the haunts of men. And at this time the Bodhisatta, after living here with his father and younger brother, as soon as the Himālayas began to blossom again and bear fruit, took his two companions and returned to his hermitage in the Himālayas. And at sunset when they were not far from his hut he left them, saying: &ldquo;You can come on slowly, while I go forward and set the hermitage in order.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Now the young ascetic coming on slowly with his father kept butting him in the waist with his head. The old man said: &ldquo;I do not like the way in which you are taking me home.&rdquo; So he turned back and started afresh from the same point. And while they were thus quarrelling, darkness set in. But the Bodhisatta as soon as he had swept out his hut of leaves, and got ready some water, took a torch and returned on the way back, and when he found them he asked why they had taken such a long time. And the boy ascetic told him what his father had done. But the Bodhisatta brought them quietly home, and having stowed safely away all the requisites, he gave his father a bath, and washed and anointed his feet and shampooed his back. Then he set out a pan of charcoal and when his father had recovered from his fatigue, he sat near him and said: &ldquo;Father, young boys are just like earthen vessels: they are broken in a moment, <span class="t18">{3.38}</span> and when they are once broken, it is impossible to mend them again. Old men should bear with them patiently, when they are abusive.&rdquo; And for the admonition of his father Kassapa, he repeated these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Should foolish youth in word or deed offend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis wisdom&rsquo;s part long-suffering to display;</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Quarrels of good men find a speedy end,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fools part asunder, like untempered clay.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Men wise to learn, of defilements aware,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And strife of neighbours skilful to allay.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.39}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Bodhisatta admonish his father. And he from that time forward exercised self-restraint.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having brought his lesson to an end, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the old monk was the father ascetic, the novice was the boy ascetic, and I myself was the son who admonished his father.&rdquo;</span></p>
