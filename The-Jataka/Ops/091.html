<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one nun remembers she was previously the wife of the Bodhisatta and had done him injury. The Buddha tells a story of a queen who felt slighted, and when the king was reborn as a six-tusked elephant, sent a hunter to take his tusks, killing him in the meanwhile. But when presented with the tusks she also pined away and died.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the king of the elephants (Nāgarājā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the nun (who could recall her earlier life) = the princess (rājakaññā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a11970"></a><span class="t15">Devadatta = the hunter (luddaka) (Sonuttara).</span></p>

<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Present and Past Compare: Dhp-a I.7 Devadatta.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a11971"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Virtue, Jealousy, Revenge.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Large-eyed and peerless one.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[5.20] </span><span class="t30">This was a story the Teacher, while sojourning at Jetavana, told of a female novice. A girl of good family at Sāvatthi, they say, recognizing the misery of the lay life, embraced the dispensation, and one day went with other nuns to hear the Dhamma from the One with Ten Powers,</span><a id="a11972"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16620"><span class="t9">{1140}</span></a><span class="t30"> as he sat preaching from a magnificent throne, and observing his person to be endued with extreme beauty of form arising from the power of illimitable merit, she thought: &ldquo;I wonder whether in a former existence those I once ministered to were this man&rsquo;s wives.&rdquo; Then at that very moment the recollection of former existences came back to her. &ldquo;In the time of Chaddanta, the elephant, I was previously existing as this man&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo; And at the remembrance great joy and gladness sprang up in her heart.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">In her joyous excitement she laughed aloud as she thought: &ldquo;Few wives are well disposed to their husbands; most of them are ill disposed. I wonder if I were well or ill disposed to this man.&rdquo; And calling back her remembrance, she perceived that she had harboured a slight grudge in her heart against Chaddanta, the mighty lord of elephants, who measured one hundred and twenty cubits, and had sent Sonuttara, a hunter, who with a poisoned arrow wounded and killed him. Then her sorrow awoke and her heart grew hot within her, and being unable to control her feelings, bursting into sobs she wept aloud. On seeing this the Teacher broke into a smile, and on being asked by the assembly of the monks, &ldquo;What, sir, was the cause of your smiling?&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Monks, this young nun wept, on recalling a wrong she once committed against me.&rdquo; And so saying he told a story of the past.</span><span class="t18"> {5.37}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11973"></a>In the past eight thousand royal elephants, by the exercise of Supernormal Powers moving through the air, dwelt near lake Chaddanta in the Himālayas. At this time the Bodhisatta came to life as the son of the chief elephant. He was pure white, with red feet and face. By and by, when grown up, he was eighty-eight cubits high, one hundred and twenty cubits long. He had a trunk like a silver rope, fifty-eight cubits long, and tusks fifteen cubits in circumference, thirty cubits long, and emitting six-coloured rays. He was the chief of a herd of eight thousand elephants and paid honour to Paccekabuddhas. His two head queens were Cullasubhaddā and Mahāsubhaddā. The king elephant, with his herd numbering eight thousand, took up his abode in a Golden Cave.</p>
<p class="p7">Now lake Chaddanta was fifty leagues long and fifty broad. In the middle of it, for a space extending twelve leagues, no sevāla or paṇaka plant is found, and it consists of water in appearance like a magic jewel. Next to this, encircling this water, was a thicket of pure white lilies, a league in <span class="t18">[5.21] </span>breadth. Next to this, and encircling it, was a thicket of pure blue lotus, a league in extent. Then came white and red lotuses, red and white lilies, and white esculent lilies, each also a league in extent and each encircling the one before. Next to these seven thickets came a mixed tangle of white and other lilies, also a league in extent, and encircling all the preceding ones. Next, in water as deep as elephants can stand in, was a thicket of red paddy. Next, in the surrounding water, was a grove of small shrubs, abounding in delicate and fragrant blossoms of blue, yellow, red and white. So these ten thickets were each a league in extent.</p>
<p class="p7">Next came a thicket of various kinds of kidney beans. Next came a tangle of convolvulus, cucumber, pumpkin, gourd and other creepers. Then a grove of sugar-cane of the size of the areca-nut tree. Then a grove of plantains with fruit as big as elephant&rsquo;s tusks. <span class="t18">{5.38}</span> Then a field of paddy. Then a grove of breadfruit of the size of a water jar. Next a grove of tamarinds with luscious fruit. Then a grove of elephant-apple trees. Then a great forest of different kinds of trees. Then a bamboo grove.</p>
<p class="p7">Such at this time was the magnificence of this region &ndash; its present magnificence is described in the Saṁyutta Commentary &ndash; but surrounding the bamboo grove were seven mountains. Starting from the extreme outside first came Little Black Mountain, next Great Black Mountain, then Water Mountain, Moon Mountain, Sun Mountain, Jewel Mountain, then the seventh in order Golden Mountain. This was seven leagues in height, rising all round the lake Chaddanta, like the rim of a bowl. The inner side of it was of a golden colour. From the light that issued from it lake Chaddanta shone like the newly risen sun. But of the outer mountains, one was six leagues in height, one five, one four, one three, one two, one a single league in height.</p>
<p class="p7">Now in the north-east corner of the lake, thus girt about with seven mountains, in a spot where the wind fell upon the water, grew a big banyan tree. Its trunk was five leagues in circumference and seven leagues in height. Four branches spread six leagues to the four points of the compass, and the branch which rose straight upwards was six leagues. So from the root upwards it was thirteen leagues in height, and from the extremity of the branches in one direction to the extremity of the branches in the opposite direction it was twelve leagues. And the tree was furnished with eight thousand shoots and stood forth in all its beauty, like to the bare Jewel Mount.</p>
<p class="p7">But on the west side of lake Chaddanta, in the Golden Mount, was a golden cave, twelve leagues in extent. Chaddanta the elephant king, with his following of eight thousand elephants, in the rainy season lived in the golden cave; in the hot season he stood at the foot of the great banyan tree, amongst its shoots, welcoming the breeze from off the water. Now one day they told him, &ldquo;The great Sāl grove is in flower.&rdquo; So attended by his herd he was <span class="t18">[5.22] </span>minded to disport himself in the Sāl grove, <span class="t18">{5.39}</span> and going there he struck with his frontal globe a Sāl tree in full bloom. At that moment Cullasubhaddā stood to windward, and dry twigs mixed with dead leaves and red ants fell upon her person. But Mahāsubhaddā stood to leeward, and flowers with pollen and stalks and green leaves fell on her. Thought Cullasubhaddā, &ldquo;He let fall on the wife dear to him flowers and pollen and fresh stalks and leaves, but on my person he dropped a mixture of dry twigs, dead leaves and red ants. Well, I shall know what to do!&rdquo; And she conceived a grudge against the Great Being.</p>
<p class="p7">Another day the king elephant and his attendant herd went down to lake Chaddanta to bathe. Then two young elephants took bundles of usīra root in their trunks and gave him a bath, rubbing him down as it were mount Kelāsa. And when he came out of the water, they bathed the two queen elephants, and they too came out of the water and stood before the Great Being. Then the eight thousand elephants entered the lake and, disporting themselves in the water, plucked various flowers from the lake, and adorned the Great Being as if it had been a silver shrine, and afterwards adorned the queen elephants.</p>
<p class="p7">Then a certain elephant, as he swam about the lake, gathered a large lotus with seven shoots and offered it to the Great Being. And he, taking it in his trunk, sprinkled the pollen on his forehead and presented the flower to the chief elephant, Mahāsubhaddā. On seeing this her rival said: &ldquo;This lotus with seven shoots he also gives to his favourite queen and not to me,&rdquo; and again she conceived a grudge against him.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day when the Bodhisatta had dressed luscious fruits and lotus stalks and fibres with the nectar of the flower, and was entertaining five hundred Paccekabuddhas, Cullasubhaddā offered the wild fruits she had got to the Paccekabuddhas, and she put up a prayer to this effect, &ldquo;Hereafter, when I pass hence, may I be reborn as the royal maiden Subhaddā in the Madda king&rsquo;s family, and on coming of age may I attain to the dignity of queen consort to the king of Benares. Then I shall be dear and charming in his eyes, and in a position to do what I please. So I will speak to the king and send a hunter with a poisoned arrow to wound and slay this elephant. <span class="t18">{5.40}</span> And thus may I be able to have brought to me a pair of his tusks that emit six-coloured rays.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Thenceforth she took no food and pining away in no long time she died, and came to life again as the child of the queen consort in the Madda kingdom, and was named Subhaddā. And when she was of a suitable age, they gave her in marriage to the king of Benares. And she was dear and pleasing in his eyes, and the chief of sixteen thousand wives. And she recalled to mind her former existences and thought: &ldquo;My prayer is fulfilled; now will I have this elephant&rsquo;s tusks brought to me.&rdquo; Then she anointed her body with common oil, put on a soiled robe, and lay in bed pretending to be <span class="t18">[5.23] </span>sick. The king said: &ldquo;Where is Subhaddā?&rdquo; And hearing that she was sick, he entered the royal closet and sitting on the bed he stroked her back and uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Large-eyed and peerless one, my queen, so pale, to grief a prey,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like wreath that&rsquo;s trampled under foot, why fadest you away?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this she spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;As it would seem, all in a dream, a longing sore I had;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My wish is vain this boon to gain, and that is why I&rsquo;m sad.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king, on hearing this, spoke a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;All joys to which in this glad world a mortal may aspire,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whate&rsquo;er they want is mine to grant, so tell me your desire.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the queen said: &ldquo;Great king, my desire is hard to attain; I will not now say what it is, but I would have all the hunters that there are in your kingdom gathered together. <span class="t18">{5.41}</span> Then will I tell it in the midst of them.&rdquo; And to explain her meaning, she spoke the next verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Let hunters all obey your call, within this realm who dwell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And what I fain from them would gain, I&rsquo;ll in their presence tell.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king agreed, and issuing forth from the royal chamber he gave orders to his ministers, saying: &ldquo;Have it proclaimed by beat of drum that all the hunters that are in the kingdom of Kāsi, three hundred leagues in extent, are to assemble.&rdquo; They did so, and in no long time the hunters that dwelt in the kingdom of Kāsi, bringing a present according to their means, had their arrival announced to the king. Now they amounted in all to about sixty thousand. And the king, hearing that they had come, stood at an open window and stretching forth his hand he told the queen of their arrival and said:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11974"></a><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Here then behold our hunters bold, well trained in venery,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Theirs is the skill wild beasts to kill, and all would die for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The queen, on hearing this, addressed them and spoke another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;You hunters bold, assembled here,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unto my words, I pray, give ear:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dreaming, I thought an elephant I saw,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11975"></a><span class="t12">Six-tusked</span><a id="a11976"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16622"><span class="t19">{1141}</span></a><span class="t12"> and white without a flaw:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His tusks I crave and fain would have;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nought else avails this life to save.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The hunters, on hearing this, replied:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er did our sires in times of old</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A six-tusked elephant behold: </span><span class="t18">{5.42}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell us what kind of beast might be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That which appeared in dreams to you.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.24]</span></p>
<p class="p6">After this still another verse was spoken by them:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Four points, North, South, East, West, one sees,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Four intermediate are to these,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nadir and zenith add, and then</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Say at which point of all the ten</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This royal elephant might be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That in a dream appeared to you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After these words Subhaddā, looking at all the hunters, spied amongst them one that was broad of foot, with a calf swollen like an alms basket, big in the knee and ribs, thick-bearded, with yellow teeth, disfigured with scars, conspicuous amongst them all as an ugly, hulking fellow, named Sonuttara, who had once been an enemy of the Great Being. And she thought: &ldquo;He will be able to do my bidding,&rdquo; and with the king&rsquo;s permission she took him with her and, climbing to the highest floor of the seven-storeyed palace, she threw open a window to the north, and stretching forth her hand towards the northern Himālayas she uttered four verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;Due north, beyond seven mountains vast,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">One comes to Golden Cliff at last,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A height by Kimpurisas possessed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And bright with flowers from foot to crest.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Beneath Kinnara peak is seen</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A cloud-shaped mass of darkest green, </span><span class="t18">{5.43}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A royal banyan tree whose roots</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yield vigour to eight thousand shoots.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. There dwells invincible in might</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This elephant, six-tusked and white,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With herd eight thousand strong for fight.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their tusks to chariot-poles are like,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wind-swift are they to guard or strike.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. Panting and grim they stand and glare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Provoked by slightest breath of air,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If they one born of man should see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their wrath consumes him utterly.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sonuttara on hearing this was terrified to death and said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;Turquoise or pearls of brilliant sheen,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With many a gold adornment, queen,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In royal houses may be seen. </span><span class="t18">{5.44}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What would you then with ivory do,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or will you slay these hunters true?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the queen spoke a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;Consumed with grief and spite am I,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When I recall my injury.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Grant me, O hunter, what I crave,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And five choice hamlets you shall have.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And with this she said: &ldquo;Friend hunter, when I gave a gift to the Paccekabuddhas, I offered up a prayer that I might have it in my power to kill this six-tusked elephant and get possession of a pair of his tusks.<span class="t18"> [5.25]</span></p>
<p class="p7">This was not merely seen by me in a vision, but the prayer that I offered up will be fulfilled. Do you go and fear not.&rdquo; And so saying she reassured him. And he agreed to her words and said: &ldquo;So be it, lady; but first make it clear to me and tell me where is his dwelling-place,&rdquo; and inquiring of her he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;Where dwells he? Where may he be found?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What road is his, for bathing bound?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where does this royal creature swim?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell us the way to capture him.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.45}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then by recalling her former existence she clearly saw the spot and told him of it in these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;Not far this bathing-place of his,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A deep and goodly pool it is:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There bees do swarm and flowers abound,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And there this royal beast is found.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. Now lotus-crowned, fresh from his bath</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He gladly takes his homeward path,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As lily-white and tall he moves</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Behind the queen he fondly loves.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sonuttara on hearing this agreed, saying: &ldquo;Fair lady, I will kill the elephant and bring you his tusks.&rdquo; Then in her joy she gave him a thousand pieces and said: &ldquo;Go home meanwhile, and at the end of seven days you shall set out there,&rdquo; and dismissing him she summoned smiths and gave them an order and said: &ldquo;Sirs, we have need of an axe, a spade, an auger, a hammer, an instrument for cutting bamboos, a grass-cutter, an iron staff, a peg, an iron three-pronged fork; make them with all speed and bring them to us.&rdquo; And sending for workers in leather, she charged them, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, you must make us a leather sack, holding a hogshead&rsquo;s weight; we have need of leather ropes and straps, shoes big enough for an elephant, and a leather parachute: make them with all speed and bring them to us.&rdquo; And both smiths and workers in leather quickly made everything <span class="t18">{5.46}</span> and brought and offered them to her.</p>
<p class="p7">Having provided everything requisite for the journey, together with firewood and the like, she put all the appliances and necessaries for the journey, such as baked meal and so forth, in the leather sack. The whole of it came to about a hogshead in weight. And Sonuttara, having completed his arrangements, arrived on the seventh day and stood respectfully in the presence of the queen. Then she said: &ldquo;Friend, all appliances for your journey are completed: take then this sack.&rdquo; And he being a stout cheat, as strong as five elephants, caught up the sack as if it had been a bag of cakes, and, placing it on his hips, stood as it were with empty hands. Cullasubhaddā gave the provisions to the hunter&rsquo;s attendants and, telling the king, dismissed Sonuttara. And he, with an obeisance to the king and queen, descended from the palace and, placing his goods in a chariot, set out <span class="t18">[5.26] </span>from the city with a great retinue, and passing through a succession of villages and hamlets reached the frontiers.</p>
<p class="p7">Then he turned back the people of the country and went on with the dwellers on the borders till he entered the forest, and passing beyond the haunts of men he sent back the border people too, and proceeded quite alone on a road to a distance of thirty leagues, traversing a dense growth of kusa and other grasses, thickets of basil, reeds and rest-harrow, clumps of thick-thorn and canes, thickets of mixed growth, jungles of reed and cane, dense forest growth, impenetrable even to a snake, thickets of trees and bamboos, tracts of mud and water, mountain tracts, eighteen regions in all, one after another.</p>
<p class="p7">The jungles of grass he cut with a sickle, the thickets of basil and the like he cleared with his instrument for cutting bamboos, the trees he felled with an axe, and the oversized ones he first pierced with an auger. Then, pursuing his way, he fashioned a ladder in the bamboo grove and climbing to the top of the thicket, he laid a single bamboo, which he had cut, over the next clump of bamboos, and thus creeping along on the top of the thicket he reached a morass. <span class="t18">{5.47}</span> Then he spread a dry plank on the mud, and stepping on it he threw another plank before him and so crossed the morass. Then he made a canoe and by means of it crossed the flooded region, and at last stood at the foot of the mountains.</p>
<p class="p7">Then he bound a three-pronged grappling-iron with a rope and flinging it aloft he caused it to lodge fast in the mountain. Then climbing up by the rope he drilled the mountain with an iron staff tipped with adamant, and knocking a peg into the hole he stood on it. Then drawing out the grappling-iron he once more lodged it high up on the mountain, and from this position letting the leather rope hang down, he took hold of it and descended and fastened the rope on the peg below. Then seizing the rope with his left hand and taking a hammer in his right he struck a blow on the rope, and having thus pulled out the peg he once more climbed up.</p>
<p class="p7">In this way he mounted to the top of the first mountain and then commencing his descent on the other side, having knocked as before a peg into the top of the first mountain and bound the rope on his leather sack and wrapped it round the peg, he sat within the sack and let himself down, uncoiling the rope like a spider letting out his thread. Then letting his leather parachute catch the wind, he went down like a bird &ndash; so at least they say.</p>
<p class="p7">Thus did the Teacher tell how in obedience to Subhaddā&rsquo;s words the hunter sallied forth from the city and traversed seventeen different tracts till he reached a mountainous region, and how he there crossed over six mountains and climbed to the top of Golden Cliff:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. &ldquo;The hunter hearing, unalarmed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Set forth with bow and quiver armed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And crossing o&rsquo;er seven mountains vast</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Reached noble Golden Cliff at last. </span><span class="t18">[5.27]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. Gaining Kinnara-haunted height,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What cloud-shaped mass bursts on his sight?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A royal banyan &rsquo;tis whose roots</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Support eight thousand spreading shoots. </span><span class="t18">{5.48}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. There stood invincible in might</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">An elephant six-tusked and white,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With herd eight thousand strong for fight;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their tusks to chariot-poles are like:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wind-swift are they to guard or strike.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. Hard by a pool &ndash; &rsquo;tis full to the brim,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fit place for royal beast to swim;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Its lovely banks with flowers abound</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And buzzing bees swarm all around.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whene&rsquo;er on bathing thought intent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He sunk a pit, to deed so mean</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Urged by the wrath of spiteful queen.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Here follows the story from beginning to end: the hunter, it is said, after seven years, seven months and seven days, having reached the dwelling-place of the Great Being in the manner related above, took note of his dwelling-place and dug a pit there, thinking: &ldquo;I will take my stand here and wound the lord of elephants and bring about his death.&rdquo; Thus did he arrange matters and went into the forest and cut down trees to make posts and prepared a lot of material. <span class="t18">{5.49}</span> Then when the elephants went to bathe, in the spot where the king elephant used to stand, he dug a square pit with a huge mattock, and the soil that he dug out he sprinkled on the top of the water, as if he were sowing seed, and on the top of stones like mortars he fixed posts, and fitted them with weights and ropes and spread planks over them. Next he made a hole of the size of an arrow and threw on the top earth and rubbish, and on one side he made an entrance for himself, and so, when the pit was finished, at break of day he fastened on a false top knot and donned robes of yellow and, taking his bow and a poisoned arrow, he went down and stood in the pit.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the whole thing clear, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. &ldquo;The pit with planks he first did hide,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then bow in hand he got inside,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And as the elephant passed by,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A mighty shaft the wretch let fly.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. The wounded beast loud roared with pain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And all the herd roared back again:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Crushed boughs and trampled grass betray</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where panic flight directs their way.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. Their lord had well nigh slain his foe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So mad with pain was he, when lo!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A robe of yellow met his eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Arahat&rsquo;s flag, monastic guise</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And deemed inviolate by the wise.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [5.28] {5.50}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being,<a id="a11978"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16624"><span class="t9">{1142}</span></a> falling into conversation with the hunter, spoke a couple of verses [Dhp 9-10]:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. &ldquo;Whoso is marred with sinful taint</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And void of truth and self-restraint,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though robed in yellow he may be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No claim to sanctity has he.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11979"></a><span class="t12">27. But one that&rsquo;s free from sinful taint,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Endued with truth and self-restraint,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And firmly fixed in righteousness,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Deserves to wear the yellow dress.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.51}</span></p>
<p class="p6">So saying, the Great Being, extinguishing all feeling of anger towards him, asked him, saying: &ldquo;Why did you wound me? Was it for your own advantage or were you instigated by someone else?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher explaining the matter then said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">28. &ldquo;The beast with mighty shaft laid low,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unruffled still, addressed his foe:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;What object, friend, in slaying me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And, pray, who instigated thee?&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the hunter told him and uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">29. &ldquo;The king of Kāsi&rsquo;s favoured queen</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Subhaddā told me she had seen</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your form in dreams, and so, said she,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ll have his tusks; go, bring them me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, and recognizing that this was the work of Cullasubhaddā, he bore his sufferings patiently and thought: &ldquo;She does not want my tusks; she sent him because she wished to kill me,&rdquo; and, to illustrate the matter, he uttered a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">30. &ldquo;Rich store of goodly tusks have I,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Relics of my dead ancestry,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And this well knows that cursed dame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis at my life the wretch does aim. </span><span class="t18">{5.52}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11980"></a><span class="t12">31. Rise, hunter, and or ere I die.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Saw off these tusks of ivory:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Go bid the shrew be of good cheer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The beast is slain; his tusks are here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing his words the hunter rose up from the place where he was sitting and, saw in hand, came close to him to cut off his tusks. Now the elephant, being like a mountain eighty cubits high, was but ineffectually cut. For the man could not reach to his tusks. So the Great Being, bending his body towards him, lay with his head down. Then the hunter climbed up the trunk of the Great Being, pressing it with his feet as though it were a silver rope, and stood on his forehead as if it had been <span class="t18">[5.29]</span> Kelāsa peak. Then he inserted his foot into his mouth, and striking the fleshy part of it with his knee, he climbed down from the beast&rsquo;s forehead and thrust the saw into his mouth. The Great Being suffered excruciating pain and his mouth was charged with blood. The hunter, shifting about from place to place, was still unable to cut the tusks with his saw.</p>
<p class="p7">So the Great Being letting the blood drop from his mouth, resigning himself to the agony, asked, saying: &ldquo;Sir, can you not cut them?&rdquo; And on his saying &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he recovered his presence of mind and said: &ldquo;Well then, since I myself have not strength enough to raise my trunk, do you lift it up for me and let it seize the end of the saw.&rdquo; The hunter did so: and the Great Being seized the saw with his trunk and moved it backwards and forwards, and the tusks were cut off as it were sprouts. Then bidding him take the tusks, he said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give you these, friend hunter, because I do not value them, <span class="t18">{5.53}</span> nor as one desiring the position of Sakka, Māra or Brahmā, but the tusks of omniscience are a hundred thousand times dearer to me than these are, and may this meritorious act be to me the cause of attaining Omniscience.&rdquo; And as he gave him the tusks, he asked, &ldquo;How long were you coming here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Seven years, seven months, and seven days.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go then by the magic power of these tusks, and you shall reach Benares in seven days.&rdquo; And he gave him a safe conduct and let him go. And after he had sent him away, before the other elephants and Subhaddā had returned, he was dead.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">32. &ldquo;The hunter then the tusks did saw</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From out that noble creature&rsquo;s jaw,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And with his shining, matchless prize</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Home with all speed he quickly hies.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When he was gone, the herd of elephants not finding their enemy came back.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">33.</span><span class="t56"> &ldquo;</span><span class="t12">Sad at his death and full of fright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The herd that took to panic flight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seeing no trace of cruel foe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Returned to find their chief laid low.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.54}</span></p>
<p class="p6">And with them also came Subhaddā, and they all then and there with weeping and lamentation betook them to the Paccekabuddhas who had been so friendly to the Great Being, and said: &ldquo;Sirs, he who supplied <span class="t18">[5.30] </span>you with the necessaries of life has died from the wound of a poisoned arrow. Come and see where his dead body is exposed.&rdquo; And the five hundred Paccekabuddhas passing through the air alighted in the sacred enclosure. At that moment two young elephants, lifting up the body of the king elephant with their tusks, and so causing it to do homage to the Paccekabuddhas, raised it aloft on a pyre and burned it. The Paccekabuddhas all through the night rehearsed scripture texts in the cemetery. The eight thousand elephants, after extinguishing the flames, first bathed and then, with Subhaddā at their head, returned to their place of abode.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make this matter clear, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">34. &ldquo;They wept and wailed, as it is said,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Each heaping dust upon his head,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then slow returning home were seen,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Behind their ever gracious queen.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And Sonuttara within seven days reached Benares with his tusks.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">35. &ldquo;The hunter straight to Kāsi hies</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bearing his bright and matchless prize</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ndash; The noble creature&rsquo;s tusks, I mean,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cheering all hearts with golden sheen &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And to that royal dame he said,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here are his tusks: the beast is dead.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.55}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now in offering them to the queen, he said: &ldquo;Lady, the elephant, against whom you conceived a grudge in your heart for a trifling offence, has been slain by me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you tell me that he is dead?&rdquo; she cried. And he gave her the tusks, saying: &ldquo;Be assured that he is dead: here are his tusks.&rdquo; She received the tusks adorned with six different coloured rays on her jewelled fan, and, placing them on her lap, gazed at the tusks of one who in a former existence had been her dear lord and she thought: &ldquo;This fellow has come with the tusks he cut from the auspicious elephant that he slew with a poisoned shaft.&rdquo; And at the remembrance of the Great Being she was filled with so great sorrow that she could not endure it, but her heart then and there was broken and that very day she died.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the story clear, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. &ldquo;His tusks no sooner did she see &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Her own dear lord of old was he &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Than straight her heart through grief did break</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And she, poor fool, died for his sake. </span><span class="t18">[5.31]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. When he, almighty and all wise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Broke into smiles before their eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Straightway these holy monks bethought,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sure Buddhas never smile for nought.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. She whom you used to see, he said,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A yellow-robed ascetic maid,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Was erst a queen and I, he cried,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Was that king elephant who died.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">39. The wretch who took those tusks so white,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unmatched on earth, so shining bright, </span><span class="t18">{5.56}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And brought them to Benares town</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is now as Devadatta known.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">40. Buddha from his own knowledge told</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This long drawn tale of times of old,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In all its sad variety,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Though free from pain and grief was he.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">41. That elephant of long ago</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Was I, the king of all the band,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And, monks, I would have you so</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This Birth aright to understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">These verses were recorded by elders as they chanted the Dhamma and sang the praises of the One with Ten Powers.</span><span class="t18"> {5.57} </span><span class="t30">And on hearing this discourse a multitude entered the First Path, but the nun afterwards by spiritual insight became an Arahat.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks speak about the Buddha&rsquo;s wisdom, and he tells this story illustrating his wisdom in a past life when a king, desiring to be instructed in goodness and truth, sought wise men throughout his realm, but they were unable to answer him.

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;This rule.&rdquo;</span><a id="a11990"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher when residing at Jetavana told concerning the Perfection of Wisdom. The circumstances leading to the introductory story will be set forth in the Mahā-ummaggajātaka [Ja 546].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">One day the monks sat in the Dhamma Hall and described the Tathāgata&rsquo;s Perfection of Wisdom, &ldquo;Monks, the Tathāgata is greatly wise, his wisdom is vast, ready, swift, sharp, crushing heretical doctrines, after having converted, by the power of his own knowledge, the brahmins Kūṭadanta and the rest, the ascetics Sabhiya and the rest, the thieves Aṅgulimāla and the rest, the Yakkhas Āḷavaka and the rest, the Devas Sakka and the rest, and the Brahmās Baka and the rest, made them humble, and ordained a vast multitude as ascetics and established them in the fruition of the paths of sanctification.&rdquo; The Teacher came up and asked what they were discoursing about, and when they told him, he replied, &ldquo;Not only now is the Tathāgata wise &ndash; in the past also, before his knowledge was fully mature, he was full of all wisdom, as he went about for the sake of wisdom and knowledge,&rdquo; and then he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a11991"></a>In the past a king called Dhanañjaya Korabya reigned in the city of Indapatta in the Kuru kingdom. A brahmin named Sucīrata was his priest and adviser in things temporal and spiritual. The king ruled his kingdom righteously, in the exercise of generosity and other good works. Now one day he prepared a question about the gift of Dhamma, and having seated the brahmin Sucīrata and paid him due honour, he put his question to him in the form of four verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;This rule and lordship I disdain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sucīrata, for I would fain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Be great, and o&rsquo;er the wide world reign. </span><span class="t18">[5.32]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. By right alone &ndash; wrong I eschew &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For whatsoe&rsquo;er is good and true</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kings above all men should pursue.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. By this for ever free from blame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here and hereafter, we may claim</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Midst gods and men a glorious name.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11992"></a><span class="t12">4. Know, brahmin, that I fain would do</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whate&rsquo;er is deemed both good and true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So pray, when asked, declare to me</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The good and true, what they may be.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.58}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now this was a profound question, falling within the range of a Buddha. This is a question one should put to an Omniscient Buddha, and, failing him, to a Bodhisatta who is seeking the Gift of Omniscience. But Sucīrata, by reason of his not being a Bodhisatta, could not solve the question, and, so far from assuming an air of wisdom, he confessed his incompetency in the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11993"></a><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;No one but Vidhura,</span><a id="a11994"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16626"><span class="t19">{1143}</span></a><span class="t12"> O king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hath power to tell this wondrous thing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What is, my lord, the good and true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That you are ever fain to do.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king on hearing his words said: &ldquo;Go then, brahmin, at once,&rdquo; and he gave him a present to take with him, and in his eagerness to get him off, he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Lo! Straight this weight of gold, my friend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By you to Vidhura I send;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Meet gift for sage who best can show</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11995"></a><span class="t12">The good and true that I would know.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.59}</span></p>
<p class="p6">And with these words he gave him a tablet of gold, worth a hundred thousand pieces of money, on which to write the answer to the question, a chariot to travel in, an army to escort him, and a present to offer, and straightaway dispatched him. Issuing from the city of Indapatta, not going straight to Benares, he first visited all places wheresoever sages dwell, and, not finding any one in all Jambudīpa to solve the question, he gradually approached Benares. Taking up his abode there, he went with a few followers to the house of Vidhura, at the time of the early meal, and having announced his arrival, he was invited in and found Vidhura at breakfast in his own house.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, repeated the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11996"></a><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Then straight in haste did Bhāradvāja</span><a id="a11997"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16628"><span class="t19">{1144}</span></a><span class="t12"> wend</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His way to Vidhura, and found his friend</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sitting at home, and ready to partake</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of simple fare, his early fast to break.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.33]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now Vidhura was a friend of his youth, and had been educated in the family of the same master, so after partaking of the meal with him, when breakfast was over, and Sucīrata was comfortably seated, on being asked by Vidhura, &ldquo;What brings you here, friend?&rdquo; he told him why he had come and repeated the eighth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;I come at far-famed Kuru king&rsquo;s behest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a11998"></a><span class="t12">Sprung from Yudhiṭṭhila,</span><a id="a11999"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16630"><span class="t19">{1145}</span></a><span class="t12"> and this his quest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To ask you, Vidhura, to tell to me</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The good and true, what it may surely be.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.60}</span></p>
<p class="p6">At that time the brahmin thinking to collect the ideas of a number of people pursues his quest, like to one piling up as it were a very Ganges flood, and there is no time for solving the problem. So stating the case he repeated the ninth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;O&rsquo;erwhelmed by such a mighty theme</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As &rsquo;twere by Gange&rsquo;s flooded stream,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I cannot tell what this may be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The good and true you seek from me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And so saying he added, &ldquo;I have a clever son, far wiser than I am: he will make it clear to you. Go to him.&rdquo; And he repeated the tenth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;A son I have, my very own,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Mongst men as Bhadrakāra known;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Go seek him out, and he&rsquo;ll declare</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a12000"></a>On hearing this Sucīrata, after leaving Vidhura&rsquo;s house, went to the dwelling of Bhadrakāra, and found him seated at breakfast in the midst of his people.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to clear up the matter, repeated the eleventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;Then Bhāradvāja hastily</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To Bhadrakāra&rsquo;s home did hie,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where amidst friends, all gathered round,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seated at ease the youth was found.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On his arrival there he was hospitably received by the youth Bhadrakāra with the offer of a chair and gifts, and taking his seat, on being asked why he had come, he repeated the twelfth verse: <span class="t18">{5.61}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;I come at far-famed Kuru king&rsquo;s behest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sprung from Yudhiṭṭhila, and this his quest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To ask you, Bhadrakāra, to show me</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Goodness and truth, what they may surely be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Bhadrakāra said to him, &ldquo;Just now, sir, I am intent on an intrigue with another man&rsquo;s wife. My mind is ill at ease, so I cannot <span class="t18">[5.34] </span>answer your question, but my young brother Sañjaya has a clearer intellect than I have. Ask him: he will answer your question.&rdquo; And in order to send him there, he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;Good venison I leave, a lizard to pursue:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How then should I know aught about the good and true?</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. I&rsquo;ve a young brother, you must know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Named Sañjaya. So, brahmin, go</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And seek him out, and he&rsquo;ll declare</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To you what truth and goodness are.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">He at once set out for the house of Sañjaya, and was welcomed by him and on being asked why he had come he told him the reason.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, uttered two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;Then Bhāradvāja hastily</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Goodness and truth, what they may surely be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But Sañjaya also was engaged in an intrigue and said to him, &ldquo;Sir, I am in pursuit of another man&rsquo;s wife, and going down to the Ganges <span class="t18">{5.62}</span> I cross over to the other side. Evening and morning as I cross the stream, I am in the jaws of death; therefore my mind is disturbed, and I shall not be able to answer your question, but my young brother Sambhava, a boy of seven years, is a hundred thousand times superior to me in knowledge. He will tell you: go and ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;Death opens wide his jaws for me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Early and late. How tell to you</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. I&rsquo;ve a young brother, you must know,</span></p>

<p class="p6">On hearing this Sucīrata thought: &ldquo;This question must be the most wonderful thing in the world. I fancy no one is equal to answering it,&rdquo; and so thinking he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. &ldquo;This marvel strange I like not me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor sire nor sons, none of the three,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. If you thus fail, can this mere youth</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Know aught of goodness and of truth?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this Sañjaya said: &ldquo;Sir, do not regard young Sambhava as a mere boy. If there is no one that can answer your question, go and ask him.&rdquo; And, describing the qualities of the youth by similes that illustrated the case, he repeated twelve verses: <span class="t18">{5.63}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. &ldquo;Ask Sambhava nor scorn his youth,</span></p>

<p class="p6">While Sañjaya was singing the praises of Sambhava, Sucīrata thought: &ldquo;I will find out by putting the question to him,&rdquo; so he asked, &ldquo;Where is your young brother?&rdquo; Then he opened the window and <span class="t18">[5.36] </span>stretching forth his hand, he said: &ldquo;You see yonder boy with a complexion like gold, playing with other youths in the street before the door of the mansion? That is my young brother. Go up to him and ask him; he will answer your question with all the charm of a Buddha.&rdquo; Sucīrata, on hearing his words, descended from the mansion, and drew near to the boy at the very moment that he was standing with his garment loose and thrown over his shoulder, <span class="t18">{5.65}</span> and picking up some dirt with both hands.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to explain the matter, repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">33. &ldquo;Then Bhāradvāja hastily</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To home of Sambhava did hie,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And there out in the public way</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The little boy was found at play.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being, when he saw the brahmin come and stand before him, asked, &ldquo;Friend, what brings you here?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Dear youth, I am wandering through all Jambudīpa, and not finding any one competent to answer the question I put to him, I have come to you.&rdquo; The boy thought: &ldquo;There is a question, they say, that has not been decided in all Jambudīpa. He has come to me. I am old in knowledge.&rdquo; And becoming ashamed he dropped the dirt that he held in his hand, readjusted his garment and said: &ldquo;Brahmin, ask on, and I will tell you with the fluent mastery of a Buddha,&rdquo; and in his omniscience he invited him to choose what he would ask. Then the brahmin asked his question in the form of a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">34. &ldquo;I come at far-famed Kuru king&rsquo;s behest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sprung from Yudhiṭṭhila, and this his quest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To ask you, Sambhava, to show to me</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Goodness and truth, what they may surely be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">What he wanted became clear to Sambhava, as it were the full moon in the middle of the sky. &ldquo;Then listen to me,&rdquo; he said, and answering the question as to the gift of Dhamma he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">35. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, sir, and tell aright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">E&rsquo;en as a man of wisdom might,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The king shall know the good and true,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But who knows what the king will do?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And as he stood in the street and taught the Dhamma with a voice sweet as honey, the sound spread over the whole of the city of Benares, to twelve leagues on every side. Then the king and all his viceroys and other rulers assembled together, and the Great Being in the midst of the multitude set forth his exposition of the Dhamma. <span class="t18">[5.37] {5.66}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12002"></a>Having thus promised in this verse to answer the question, he now gave the answer as to the gift of Dhamma:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. &ldquo;In answer to the king, Sucīrata, proclaim,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tomorrow and today are never quite the same;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I bid you then, O king Yudhiṭṭhila, be wise</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And prompt to seize whate&rsquo;er occasion may arise.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. I fain would have you too, Sucīrata, suggest</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A thought in which his mind may profitably rest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A king all wicked ways should carefully eschew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor, like bewildered fool, an evil course pursue.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. To loss of his own soul he never should transgress,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor e&rsquo;er be guilty of deeds of unrighteousness,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Himself ne&rsquo;er be engaged in any evil way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor ever in wrong path a brother lead astray.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">39. These points to carry out whoso does rightly know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like waxing moon, as king in fame does ever grow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12003"></a><span class="t12">40. A shining light to friends and dear unto his kin,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And, when his body fails, the sage to heaven will win.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.67}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being thus, like to one making the moon to rise in the sky, answered the brahmin&rsquo;s question with all the mastery of a Buddha. The people roared and shouted and clapped their hands. And there arose a thousand cries of applause with a great waving of cloths and snapping of fingers. And they cast off the trinkets on their hands. And the value of what they threw down amounted to about a crore. And the king of Benares in his joy paid him great honour. And Sucīrata, after offering him a thousand weight of gold, wrote down the answer to the question with vermilion on a golden tablet, and on coming to the city of Indapatta he told the king the answer as to the gift of Dhamma. And the king abiding steadfast in righteousness attained to heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12004"></a><a id="a12005"></a><span class="t30">At the end of the lesson the Teacher said: &ldquo;Not merely now, monks, but formerly too, the Tathāgata was great in answering questions,&rdquo; and he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was king Dhanañjaya, Anuruddha was Sucīrata, Kassapa was Vidhura, Moggallāna was Bhadrakāra, Sāriputta was the youth Sañjaya, and I myself was the wise Sambhava.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks are talking about how Devadatta threw a stone at the Buddha. The latter tells a story of how a monkey had once saved a man who had fallen into a deep pit, but when out of danger the man tried to kill the monkey and eat his flesh. Because of his deed he contracted leprosy and later was swallowed by the great earth.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the king of the monkeys (kapirājā),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;A king of Kāsi.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher, when dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta&rsquo;s hurling a stone at him. </span><span class="t18">{5.68}</span><span class="t30"> So when the monks blamed Devadatta for having instigated archers to shoot the Buddha and afterwards hurled a stone at him, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Not only now, but formerly also, Devadatta flung a stone at me,&rdquo; and so saying he related a story of the past.</span><span class="t18"> [5.38]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, a brahmin farmer in a village of Kāsi, after ploughing his fields, loosened his oxen and began to work with a spade. The oxen, while cropping leaves in a clump of trees, little by little escaped into the forest. The man, discovering that it was late, laid aside his spade to look for his oxen, and not finding them he was overcome with grief and wandered about the forest, seeking them, till he had entered the Himālayas region. There having lost his bearings he roamed about for seven days fasting, but seeing a tiṇḍuka tree he climbed up it to eat the fruit. Slipping off the tree he fell sixty cubits into a hell-like abyss, where he passed ten days.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time the Bodhisatta was living in the shape of a monkey, and while eating wild fruits he caught sight of the man, and after practising with a stone he hauled the fellow out. While the monkey was asleep, the man split his head open with a stone. The Great Being, becoming aware of his action, sprang up and perched on a branch of the tree and cried, &ldquo;Ho! Sirrah, you walk on the ground; I will just point out to you the way from the top of the tree and then will be off.&rdquo; So he rescued the fellow from the forest, set him on the right road and then himself disappeared in the mountainous region.</p>
<p class="p7">The man, because he had done wrong against the Great Being, became a leper, and even in this world appeared as a Peta in human form. For seven years he was overwhelmed with pain, and in his wanderings to and fro he found his way into the Migācira park in Benares, and spreading a plantain leaf in the enclosure he lay down, half maddened by his sufferings. At that moment the king of Benares came to the park and as he walked about he saw the man and asked him, &ldquo;Who are you, and what have you done to bring this suffering upon yourself?&rdquo; And he told the king the whole story at length.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;A king of Kāsi who, they say,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O&rsquo;er great Benares once held sway,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is praised in this world by the wise. </span><span class="t18">{5.70}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. Once in a lonely wood I took my way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seeking my kine that late had gone astray;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Through pathless tracts of jungle, fitting home</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For the wild elephant, I heedless roam.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. Lost in the maze of this vast wilderness,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From thirst and hunger suffering sore distress,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For seven long days I wander through the wood</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where the fell tiger rears his savage brood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. E&rsquo;en rankest poison I was fain to eat</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When lo! a lovely tree my gaze does meet;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O&rsquo;er a sheer precipice it pendent swung,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And fragrant fruit from all its branches hung.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. Whate&rsquo;er had fallen to the wind&rsquo;s cold touch</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I greedily devoured and relished much,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then, still unsated, I climbed up the tree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That way, I thought, lies full satiety.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. I ne&rsquo;er had tasted such ripe fruit before,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And stretching forth my hand to gather more,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The branch, on which my body rested, broke,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As though clean severed by the woodman&rsquo;s stroke.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. With broken bough head over heels I went,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With nought to check me in my swift descent</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Over the side of rocky precipice,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Without escape from bottomless abyss.</span><span class="t18"> [5.40]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. The depth of water in the pool beneath</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Saved me from being rudely crushed to death,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So there, poor luckless wight, without a ray</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of hope to cheer me, ten long nights I lay.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. At length a monkey came &ndash; long-tailed was he</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And made his home in some rock cavity</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And as he stepped from bough to bough, the brute</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Did ever pluck and eat the dainty fruit.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. But when my thin and pallid form he spied,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Touched with compassion for my woes, he cried,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Alas, poor wretch, whom I see lying there</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12016"></a><span class="t12">Thus overwhelmed with anguish and despair.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12017"></a><span class="t12">19. If a man or Amanussa declare.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12018"></a><span class="t12">Then with due reverence I made reply;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;A man and doomed without escape am I:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But this I say, &ldquo;All blessings light on you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you can find a way of saving me.&rdquo; &rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. The monkey stepping on the height above</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Carried a heavy stone, his strength to prove,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And when by practice he was perfect grown,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The mighty one his purpose thus made known.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. &lsquo;Climb you, good sir, upon my back and cast</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your arms about my neck and hold me fast;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then will I with all speed deliver you</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From the stone walls of your captivity.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. I hearkened gladly, well remembering</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The counsels of the glorious monkey-king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And, climbing on his back, my arms I cast</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Round the wise creature&rsquo;s neck and held him fast.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. The monkey then &ndash; so brave and strong was he &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Exhausted by the effort though he be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From rocky fastness soon uplifteth me.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. And having haled me out, the hero cried,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;m weary: stand as guard, sir, by my side,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">While I anon in peaceful sleep abide.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If they should ever take me unaware,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Would kill me straight. To watch shall be your care.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. While, as I watched, he took a moment&rsquo;s rest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">An ugly thought was harboured in my breast.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. &lsquo;Monkeys and such like deer are good to eat;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What if I kill him and my hunger cheat?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The beast if slain would furnish savoury meat.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">28. When sated, here no longer will I stay</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But well provisioned for full many a day</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Out from this forest I will find a way.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">29. Taking a stone his skull I well nigh broke,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But a lame hand put forth a feeble stroke.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">30. The monkey quickly bounded up a tree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And all bestained with blood regarded me</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From far, with tearful eyes, reproachfully.</span><span class="t18"> [5.41]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">31. &lsquo;God bless you, act not thus, I pray, good sir,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For otherwise your fate, I dare aver,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Will long all others from such deeds deter.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">32. Alas, for shame. What a return is this</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For having saved you from that dread abyss!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">33. Rescued from death you played a treacherous part</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And evil have devised with evil heart.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">34. Vile wretch, beware lest sharpest agony</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Springing from evil deed bring death to thee,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">35. I trust you not, for you would work me ill:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Walk well in front that I may see you still.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. From ravening beast escaped, you may regain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The haunts of men: the path that stretches plain</span></p>

<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. At this the monkey dried his tears, and sped</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Up to a mountain lake, and bathed his head</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From stain of blood &ndash; by me, alas, &rsquo;twas shed &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. There too, with burning pains through him accursed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I dragged my tortured frame, to quench my thirst,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">39. But when to that blood-stainéd lake I came,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The crimson flood appeared one mass of flame.</span><span class="t18"> {5.72}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">40. Each liquid drop from it that did bedew</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My body, straight into a pustule grew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like a cleft wood apple-fruit, in size and hue.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">41. The sores discharging yield a loathsome smell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And whereso&rsquo;er I fain would gladly dwell</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In town and countryside, all fly pell-mell.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">42. Scattered by odours foul, the while they ply</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their sticks and stones, and: &lsquo;Come not you too nigh</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To us, poor wretch,&rsquo; all men and women cry.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">44. May good be with you all that here I see:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Betray you not your friends. How vile is he</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That does wrong &rsquo;gainst a friend with treachery.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">45. All who on earth to friends have proved untrue,</span></p>

<p class="p6">And while the man was speaking with the king, even as he spoke, the earth opened its mouth, and at that very moment the man disappeared and was reborn in hell. The king, when the man was swallowed up in the earth, came forth from the park and entered the city.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher here ending his lesson said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but formerly too, Devadatta flung a stone at me,&rdquo; and he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the treacherous friend was Devadatta, I myself was the monkey-king.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a12026"></a><span class="t15">No story of the present is given. The Buddha tells a story of a wise man, Mahosadha, who had a conversation with a female sage by signs, and how it was misconstrued by a jealous queen. The female sage then asks the king who would he sacrifice if pressed, he answers he would sacrifice all, including himself, but not Mahosadha.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (paṇḍita) Mahosadha,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Uppalavaṇṇī = (the female ascetic) Bherī,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Sāriputta = (king) Cullaṇī.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">All of this </span><span class="t18">{5.75} </span><a id="a12028"></a><span class="t30">will be set forth in the Mahā-ummaggajātaka [Ja 546].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now Pañcālacaṇḍī was very dear and precious to the king; and in the second year she bore him a son. In his tenth year, king Vedeha died. The Bodhisatta raised the royal parasol for him, and asked leave to go to his grandfather, king Cullaṇī. The boy said: &ldquo;Wise sir, do not leave me in my childhood; I will honour you as a father.&rdquo; And Pañcālacaṇḍī said: &ldquo;Wise sir, there is none to protect us if you go; do not go.&rdquo; But he replied, &ldquo;My promise has been given; I cannot but go.&rdquo; So amidst the lamentations of the multitude, he departed with his servants, and came to Uttarapañcāla city. The king hearing of his arrival came to meet him, and led him into the city with great pomp, and gave him a great house, and besides the eighty villages given at first, gave him another present; and he served that king.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">At that time a wanderer, named Bherī, used to take her meals constantly in the palace; she was wise and learned, and she had never seen the Great Being before; she heard the report that the wise Mahosadha was serving the king. He also had never seen her before, but he heard that a wanderer named Bherī had her meals in the palace. Now queen Nandā was ill pleased with the Bodhisatta, because he had separated her from her husband&rsquo;s love, and caused her annoyance; so she sent for five women whom she trusted, and said: &ldquo;Watch for a fault in the wise man, and let us try to make him fall out with the king.&rdquo; So they went about looking for an occasion against him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">One day it so happened that this wanderer after her meal was going forth, and caught sight of the Bodhisatta in the courtyard on his way to wait on the king. He saluted her, and stood still. She thought: &ldquo;This they say is a wise man: I will see whether he be wise or no.&rdquo; So she asked him a question by a gesture of the hand: looking towards the Bodhisatta, she opened her hand. Her idea was to enquire whether the king took good care or not of this wise man whom he had brought from another country. When the Bodhisatta saw that she was asking him a question by gesture, he answered it by clenching his fist: what he meant was, &ldquo;Your reverence, the king brought me here in fulfilment of a promise, and now he keeps his fist tight closed and gives me nothing.&rdquo; She understood; and stretching out her hand she rubbed her head, as much as to say, &ldquo;Wise sir, if you are displeased, why do you not become an ascetic like me?&rdquo; At this the Great Being stroked his stomach, as who should say, &ldquo;Your reverence, there are many that I have to support, and that is why I do not become an ascetic.&rdquo; After this dumb questioning she returned to her dwelling, and the Great Being saluted her and went in to the king.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now the queen&rsquo;s confidantes saw all this from a window; and coming before the king, they said: &ldquo;My lord, Mahosadha has made a plot with Bherī the ascetic to seize your kingdom, and he is your enemy.&rdquo; So they slandered him. &ldquo;What have you heard or seen?&rdquo; the king asked. They said: &ldquo;Sire, as the ascetic was going out after her meal, seeing the Great Being, she opened her hand; as one who should say, &lsquo;Cannot you crush the king flat like the palm of the hand or a threshing-floor, and seize the kingdom for yourself?&rsquo; And Mahosadha clenched his fist, making as though he held a sword, as one who should say, &lsquo;In a few days I will cut off his head and get him into my power.&rsquo; She signalled, &lsquo;Cut off his head,&rsquo; by rubbing her own head with her hand; the Great Being signalled, &lsquo;I will cut him in half,&rsquo; by rubbing his belly. Be vigilant, sire! Mahosadha ought to be put to death.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The king, hearing this, thought: &ldquo;I cannot hurt this wise man; I will question the ascetic.&rdquo; Next day accordingly, at the time of her meal, he came up and asked, &ldquo;Madam, have you seen wise Mahosadha?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sire, yesterday, as I was going out after my meal.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you have any conversation together?&rdquo; &ldquo;Conversation? No; but I had heard of his wisdom, and in order to try it I asked him, by dumb signs, shutting my hand, whether the king was open-handed to him or close-fisted, did he treat him with kindness or not. He closed his fist, implying that his master had made him come here in fulfilment of a promise, and now gave him nothing. Then I rubbed my head, to enquire why he did not become an ascetic if he were not satisfied; he stroked his belly, meaning that there were many for him to feed, many bellies to fill, and therefore he did not become an ascetic.&rdquo; &ldquo;And is Mahosadha a wise man?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, indeed, sire: in all the earth there is not his like for wisdom.&rdquo; After hearing her account, the king dismissed her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">After she had gone, the sage came to wait upon the king; and the king asked him, &ldquo;Have you seen, sir, the wanderer Bherī?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sire, I saw her yesterday on her way out, and she asked me a question by dumb signs, and I answered her at once.&rdquo; And he told the story as she had done. The king in his pleasure that day gave him the post of commander-in-chief, and put him in sole charge. Great was his glory, second only to the king&rsquo;s. He thought: &ldquo;The king all at once has given me exceeding great renown; this is what kings do even when they wish to slay. Suppose I try the king to see whether he has goodwill towards me or not. No one else will be able to find this out; but the wanderer Bherī is full of wisdom, and she will find a way.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">So taking a quantity of flowers and scents, he went to the wanderer and, after saluting her, said: &ldquo;Madam, since you told the king of my merits, the king has overwhelmed me with splendid gifts; but whether he does it in sincerity or not I do not know. It would be well if you could find out for me the king&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo; She promised to do so; and next day, as she was going to the palace, the Question of the Water Rakkhasa (Dakarakkhasa) came into her mind. Then this</span><span class="t40"> </span><span class="t11">occurred to her, &ldquo;I must not be like a spy, but I must find an opportunity to ask the question, and discover whether the king has goodwill to the wise man.&rdquo; So she went. And after her meal, she sat still, and the king saluting her sat down on one side. Then she thought: &ldquo;If the king bears ill-will to the sage, and when he is asked the question if he declares his ill-will in the presence of a number of people, that will not do; I will ask him apart.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;Sire, I wish to speak to you in private.&rdquo; The king sent his attendants away. She said: &ldquo;I want to ask your majesty a question.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ask, madam, and if I know it I will reply.&rdquo; Then she recited the first verse in the Question of Dakarakkhasa:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">1. &ldquo;If there were seven of you voyaging on the ocean, and a Yakkha seeking for a human sacrifice should seize the ship, in what order would you give them up and save yourself from the Water Rakkhasa?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The king answered by another verse, in all sincerity:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">2. &ldquo;First I would give my mother, next my wife, next my brother, fourth my friend, fifth my brahmin, sixth myself, but I would not give up Mahosadha.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Thus the ascetic discovered the goodwill of the king towards the Great Being; but his merit was not published thereby, so she thought of something else, &ldquo;In a large company I will praise the merits of these others, and the king will praise the wise man&rsquo;s merit instead; thus the wise man&rsquo;s merit will be made as clear as the moon shining in the sky.&rdquo; So she collected all the denizens of the inner palace, and in their presence asked the same question and received the same answer: then she said: &ldquo;Sire, you say that you would give first your mother: but a mother is of great merit, and your mother is not as other mothers, she is very useful.&rdquo; And she recited her merits in a couple of verses:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">3. &ldquo;She reared you and she brought you forth, and for a long time was kind to you, when Chambhī offended against you she was wise and saw what was for your good, and by putting a counterfeit in your place she saved you from harm.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">4. Such a mother, who gave you life, your own mother who bore you in her womb, for what fault could you give her to the Water Rakkhasa?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">To this the king replied, &ldquo;Many are my mother&rsquo;s virtues, and I acknowledge her claims upon me, but mine are still more numerous,&rdquo; and then he described her faults in a couple of verses:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">5-6. &ldquo;Like a young girl she wears ornaments which she ought not to use, she mocks unseasonably at doorkeepers and guards, unbidden she sends messages to rival kings; and for these faults I would give her to the Water Rakkhasa.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">&ldquo;So be it, sire; yet your wife has much merit,&rdquo; and she declared her merit thus:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">7-8. &ldquo;She is chief amongst womankind, she is exceedingly gracious of speech, devoted, virtuous, who cleaves to you like your shadow, not given to anger, prudent, wise, who sees your good: for what fault would you give your wife to the Water Rakkhasa?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">He described her faults:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">9. &ldquo;By her sensual attractions she has made me subject to evil influence, and asks what she should not for her sons.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">10. In my passion I give her many and many a gift; I relinquish what is very hard to give, and afterwards I bitterly repent: for that fault I would give my wife to the Water Rakkhasa.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The ascetic said: &ldquo;Be it so: but your younger brother prince Tikhiṇamantī is useful to you; for what fault would you give him?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12029"></a><span class="t25">11-12. &ldquo;He who gave prosperity to the people, and when you were living in foreign parts brought you back home, he whom great wealth could not influence, peerless bowman and hero, Tikhiṇamantī: for what fault would you give your brother to the Water Rakkhasa?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The king described his fault:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">13. &ldquo;He thinks, I gave prosperity to the people, I brought him back home when he was living in foreign parts, great wealth could not influence me.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">14. I am a peerless bowman and hero, and sharp in counsel, by me he was made king.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">15. He does not come to wait on me, madam, as he used to do; that is the fault for which I would give my brother to the Water Rakkhasa.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The ascetic said: &ldquo;So much for your brother&rsquo;s fault: but prince Dhanusekha is devoted in his love for you, and very useful,&rdquo; and she described his merit:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">16. &ldquo;In one night both you and Dhanusekha were born here, both called Pañcāla, friends and companions:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">17. Through all your life he has followed you, your joy and pain were his, zealous and careful by night and day in all service: for what fault would you give your friend to the Water Rakkhasa?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Then the king described his fault:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">18. &ldquo;Madam, through all my life he used to make merry with me, and today also he makes free excessively for the same reason.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">19. If I talk in secret with my wife, in he comes unbidden and unannounced.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">20. Give him a chance and an opening, he acts shamelessly and disrespectfully. That is the fault for which I would give my friend to the Water Rakkhasa.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The ascetic said: &ldquo;So much for his fault; but the family priest is very useful to you,&rdquo; and she described his merit:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">21-22. &ldquo;He is clever, knows all omens and sounds, skilled in signs and dreams, goings out and comings in, understands all the tokens in earth and air and stars: for what fault would you give the brahmin to the Water Rakkhasa?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The king explained his fault:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">23. &ldquo;Even in company he stares at me with open eyes; therefore I would give this rascal with his puckered brows to the Water Rakkhasa.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Then the ascetic said: &ldquo;Sire, you say you would give to the Water Rakkhasa all these five, beginning with your mother, and that you would give your own life for the wise Mahosadha, not taking into account your great glory: what merit do you see in him?&rdquo; and she recited these verses:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">24-25. &ldquo;Sire, you dwell amidst your courtiers in a great continent surrounded by the sea, with the ocean in place of an encircling wall: lord of the earth, with a mighty empire, victorious, sole emperor, your glory has become great.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">26. You have sixteen thousand women dressed in jewels and ornaments, women of all nations, resplendent like Devakaññā.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">27. Thus provided for every need, every desire fulfilled, you have lived long in happiness and bliss.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">28. Then by what reason or what cause do you sacrifice your precious life to protect the sage?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">On hearing this, he recited the following verses in praise of the wise man&rsquo;s merit:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">29. &ldquo;Since Mahosadha, madam, came to me, I have not seen the steadfast man do the most trifling wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">30. If I should die before him at any time, he would bring happiness to my sons and grandsons.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">31. He knows all things, past or future. This man without wrong I would not give to the Water Rakkhasa.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Thus this Jātaka came to its appropriate end. Then the ascetic thought: &ldquo;This is not enough to show forth the wise man&rsquo;s merits; I will make them known to all people in the city, like one that spreads scented oil over the surface of the sea.&rdquo; So taking the king with her, she came down from the palace, and prepared a seat in the palace courtyard, and made him sit there; then gathering the people together, she asked the king that Question of the Water Rakkhasa over again from the beginning; and when he had answered it as described above, she addressed the people thus:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">32. &ldquo;Hear this, men of Pañcāla, which Cullaṇī has said. To protect the wise man he sacrifices his own precious life.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">33. His mother&rsquo;s life, his wife&rsquo;s and his brother&rsquo;s, his friend&rsquo;s life and his own, Pañcāla is ready to sacrifice.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">34. So marvellous is the power of wisdom, so clever and so intelligent, for good in this world and for happiness in the next.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">So like one that places the topmost pinnacle upon a heap of treasure, she put the pinnacle on her demonstration of the Great Being&rsquo;s merit.</span></p>
