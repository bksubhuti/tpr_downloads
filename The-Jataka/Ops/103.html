Now from the time when by an Assertion of Truth he saved the life of a woman having a difficult delivery he easily obtained offerings of food and by cultivating retirement he afterwards attained to Arahatship and became recognised as one of the eighty great elders.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At that time they started this subject in the Dhamma Hall, saying: &ldquo;Oh! What a miracle, sirs, was wrought by the Fortunate One in that he thus peacefully and without using any violence converted and humbled such a cruel and blood-stained robber as Aṅgulimāla: Oh! Buddhas verily do mighty works!&rdquo; The Teacher seated in the Perfumed Chamber by his divine sense of hearing caught what was said and, knowing that today his coming would be very helpful and that there would be an exposition of a great Dhamma, with the incomparable grace of a Buddha he went to the Dhamma Hall and there sitting on the seat reserved for him he asked what theme they were discussing in the meeting; and when they told him what it was he said: &ldquo;There is no marvel, monks, in my converting him now, </span><span class="t18">{5.457}</span><a id="a12953"></a><span class="t30"> when I have attained to the highest Awakening. I also tamed him when I was living in a previous stage of existence and in a condition of only limited</span><a id="a12954"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17169"><span class="t9">{1404}</span></a><span class="t30"> knowledge,&rdquo; and with these words he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past a king named Koravya exercised a righteous rule in the city of Indapatta, in the kingdom of Kuru. The Bodhisatta came to life as the child of his chief queen, and from his fondness for pressed soma juice they called him Sutasoma. When he was come of age his father sent him to Taxila to be educated by a teacher of world-wide fame. So taking his teacher&rsquo;s fee he started on his way there. At Benares, too, prince Brahmadatta, son of the king of Kāsi, was sent by his father for a like purpose and set out upon the same road.</p>
<p class="p7">In the course of his journey Sutasoma to rest himself sat down on a bench in a hall by the city gate. Prince Brahmadatta, too, came and sat down with him on the same bench. After a friendly greeting Sutasoma asked him, saying: &ldquo;Friend, you are tired with your journey. Whence have you come?&rdquo; On his saying &ldquo;From Benares,&rdquo; he asked whose son he was. &ldquo;The son of Brahmadatta.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what is your name?&rdquo; &ldquo;Prince Brahmadatta.&rdquo; &ldquo;With what object are you come?&rdquo; &ldquo;To be instructed in arts,&rdquo; he replied. Then prince <span class="t18">[5.247]</span> Brahmadatta said: &ldquo;You too are tired with your journey,&rdquo; and questioned him in like manner. And Sutasoma told him all about himself. And they both thought: &ldquo;We are two princes going to receive instruction in arts at the hands of the same teacher,&rdquo; and struck up a friendship one with another.</p>
<p class="p7">Then entering the city they repaired to the teacher&rsquo;s house and saluted him, and after declaring their origin they said they had come to be instructed in arts. He readily agreed with their proposals. Offering him the fee for instruction they entered upon their studies, and not merely they, but other princes who were at that time in Jambudīpa, to the number of one hundred and one, received instruction from the teacher. Sutasoma being the senior pupil soon attained to proficiency in teaching, and without visiting the others <span class="t18">{5.458}</span><a id="a12955"></a> he thought: &ldquo;This is my friend,&rdquo; and went to prince Brahmadatta only, and becoming his private teacher<a id="a12956"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17171"><span class="t9">{1405}</span></a> he soon educated him, while the others only gradually acquired their learning.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12957"></a>They, too, after zealous application to their studies bade farewell to their teacher, and forming an escort to Sutasoma set out on their return journey. Then Sutasoma standing in front of them dismissed them, saying: &ldquo;After you have given a proof of your learning to your respective fathers you will be established each in your own kingdom. When so established see that you obey my instructions.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are they, Teacher?&rdquo; &ldquo;On the days of the new and full moon<a id="a12958"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17173"><span class="t9">{1406}</span></a> to keep Uposatha precepts and to abstain from taking the life of anything.&rdquo; They readily agreed to this. The Bodhisatta, from his power of prognosticating from personal appearance, knew that great danger would arise with regard to the prince of Benares in the future, and thus after due admonition he dismissed them. And they all returned to their own countries, and after an exhibition of their learning to their fathers succeeded to their respective kingdoms. And to make known this fact and that they were continuing in his admonition, together with a present, they sent letters to Sutasoma. The Great Being on learning the state of affairs answered their letters, bidding them be earnest in the faith.</p>
<p class="p7">One of them, the king of Benares, never ate his rice meal without meat, and to observe a holy day they would take his meat and put it on one side. Now one day when the meat was thus reserved, by the carelessness of the cook the well-bred dogs in the king&rsquo;s palace ate it. The cook not finding it took a handful of coins and going a round failed to procure any meat and said: &ldquo;If I should serve a meal without meat, I am a dead man. What am I to do?&rdquo; But thinking: &ldquo;There is still a way,&rdquo; late in the evening he went to a cemetery where dead bodies are exposed and taking some flesh from the thigh of a man who had just died, he roasted it <span class="t18">[5.248] </span><a id="a12959"></a>thoroughly and served it up as a meal. No sooner was a bit of the meat placed on the tip of the king&rsquo;s tongue than it sent a thrill through the seven thousand nerves of taste and continued to create a disturbance throughout his whole body. Why was this? From his having previously resorted to this food. For it is said that as a Yakkha, in the birth immediately preceding this, he had eaten quantities of human flesh, and so it was agreeable to his taste.<a id="a12960"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17175"><span class="t9">{1407}</span></a> <span class="t18">{5.459}</span> The king thought: &ldquo;If I shall eat this in silence, he will not tell me what this meat is,&rdquo; so in spitting he let a piece fall to the ground. When the cook said: &ldquo;You may eat it, sire; there is nothing wrong with it,&rdquo; he ordered all his attendants to retire and said: &ldquo;I know it is all right, but what meat is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;What your Majesty has enjoyed on previous days.&rdquo; &ldquo;Surely the meat had not this flavour at any other time?&rdquo; &ldquo;It was well cooked today, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Surely you cooked it exactly like this before?&rdquo; Then seeing him reduced to silence he said: &ldquo;Either tell me the truth or you are a dead man.&rdquo; So he prayed for an assurance of indemnity and told the exact truth. The king said: &ldquo;Do not say a word about it. You are to eat the usual roast meat and cook human flesh only for me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Surely this is a difficult matter, sire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not be afraid: there is no difficulty.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whence shall I be able to get it continually?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are there not numbers of men in prison?&rdquo; Thenceforth he acted on this suggestion.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12961"></a>By and by, when prisoners failed him, he said: &ldquo;What am I to do now?&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;Throw down in the high road a parcel of a thousand pieces of money and seize as a thief any one that picks it up and put him to death.&rdquo; He did so. By and by, not finding a creature so much as looking at the packet of money, he said: &ldquo;Now what am I to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;At the time when a drum sounds the night watches, the city is crowded with people. Then, taking your stand in the cleft<a id="a12962"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17177"><span class="t9">{1408}</span></a> of a house wall or at a crossroads, strike down a man and carry off some of his flesh.&rdquo; From that day he used to come with some fat flesh, and in various places dead bodies were found.</p>
<p class="p7">A sound of lamentation was heard, &ldquo;I have lost my father, I have lost my mother, or brother or sister.&rdquo; The men of the city were panic-stricken and said: &ldquo;Surely some lion or tiger or Yakkha has devoured these people.&rdquo; On examining the bodies they saw what looked like a gaping wound and said: &ldquo;Why it must be a man that eats their flesh!&rdquo; The people gathered together in the palace-yard and made a complaint. The king asked, &ldquo;What is it, my friends?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;in this city is some man-eating robber: have him <span class="t18">[5.249] </span>seized.&rdquo; &ldquo;How am I to know who it is? Am I to walk round and guard the city?&rdquo; The people said, <span class="t18">{5.460}</span> &ldquo;The king has not a care for the city: we will report it to the commander-in-chief, Kāḷahatthi.&rdquo; They told him and said: &ldquo;You must search for this robber.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Wait for seven days and I will seek out the robber and hand him over to you.&rdquo; And dismissing the people he gave orders to his officers, saying: &ldquo;My friends, they say there is a man-eating robber in this city. You are to lay an ambuscade in various places and capture him.&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and from that day they surrounded the whole city.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the cook was concealed in a hole in the wall of a house and he killed a woman and began to fill his basket with pieces of solid flesh. So the officers seized and buffeted him, and tying his arms behind him they raised a loud cry, &ldquo;We have caught the man-eating robber.&rdquo; A crowd of people gathered around them. Then beating him soundly and fastening the basket of flesh upon his neck they brought him before the commander-in-chief. On seeing him he thought: &ldquo;Can it be that this fellow eats this flesh or does he mix it with other meat and sell it, or does he kill people at the bidding of somebody else?&rdquo; And inquiring into the matter he spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Teacher of dainty flavours, what dire need</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Has urged you on to do this dreadful deed?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Have you for food to eat or wealth to gain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Misguided wretch, these men and women slain?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The verses that follow are of obvious connection and are to be understood as uttered by alternate speakers in accordance with the scripture context:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Neither for wife or child, friends, kin or pelf,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor did I slay this woman for myself;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My gracious lord, the sovereign of this land,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eats human flesh: I did wrong at his command.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;If thus instigated to sate your master&rsquo;s greed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You have been guilty of this awful deed, </span><span class="t18">{5.461}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let us at early dawn seek out the king</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And in his face the accusation fling.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;O Kāḷahatthi, worshipful good lord,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So will I do according to your word,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At early dawn will I seek out the king</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And in his face this accusation fling.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So the commander had him laid down, firmly bound, and at dawn he took counsel with his officers, and as they were unanimous he stationed guards in every direction, and having got the city well in hand he bound the basket of flesh on the cook&rsquo;s neck and went off with him to the palace, and the whole city was in an uproar. The king had breakfasted the day before, but had gone without his supper and had spent the whole night in a sitting posture, expecting the cook to come every moment. &ldquo;Today, too,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;no cook comes, and I hear a great uproar in the city. What <span class="t18">[5.250] </span>can it all be about?&rdquo; and looking out of the window he saw the man being dragged there as described, and thinking everything was discovered he plucked up his courage and took his seat on his throne. And Kāḷahatthi drew nigh and questioned him, and the king answered him.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo; &rsquo;Twas now sunrise and day had scarce begun to break,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As Kāḷa to the court with cook his way did take,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And drawing nigh the king words such as these he spake:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &lsquo;Sire, is it true this cook was sent into the street,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And men and women slew to furnish you with meat?&rsquo;</span><span class="t23"> </span><span class="t18">{5.462}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &lsquo;Kāḷa, &rsquo;tis even so; &rsquo;twas done at my request:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why blame him then for what he did at my behest?&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the commander-in-chief thought: &ldquo;With his own mouth he confesses it; Oh, the ruffian! All this long time he has been eating men: I will stop him from this,&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;Sire, do not this thing; eat not the flesh of men.&rdquo; &ldquo;Kāḷahatthi, what is it you say? I cannot cease from it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, if you do not cease from it, you will destroy both yourself and your realm.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even though my realm be destroyed, I cannot possibly cease from it.&rdquo; Then the commander, to bring him to a better mind, told him a story by way of illustration.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx29974"></a>The Fish Ānanda</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12963"></a><a id="a12964"></a>In the past there were six monster fishes in the ocean. Amongst them were Ānanda, Timanda, Ajjhohāra &ndash; these three were five hundred leagues in extent &ndash; Tītimīti, Miṅgala, Timirapiṅgala &ndash; these were a thousand leagues long &ndash; and all of them fed upon the rock eelgrass<a id="a12965"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17179"><span class="t9">{1409}</span></a> weed. Of them Ānanda dwelt on one side of the ocean and many fish came to see him. One day they thought: &ldquo;Amongst all bipeds and quadrupeds kings are to be found, but we have no king: we will make this fish our king.&rdquo; And being all of one mind they made Ānanda their king, and from that day the fish evening and morning came to pay their respects to him.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12966"></a><a id="a12967"></a><a id="a12968"></a>Now one day Ānanda on a certain mountain was feeding on rock eelgrass and unwittingly ate a fish, thinking it to be eelgrass. <span class="t18">{5.463}</span> Its flesh was pleasing to his taste, and wondering what it could be that was so very sweet, he took it out of his mouth and looking at it found it was a piece of fish. He thought: &ldquo;All this long time in my ignorance I never ate this: evening and morning when the fish come to pay their respects to me, I will devour one or two of them, for if when they are being eaten I make the fact too clear to them, not a single one will come near me, but they will all scurry off.&rdquo; So lying in concealment he struck at any that were retreating from behind and devoured them. The fish as their numbers gradually diminished thought: &ldquo;From what quarter will this peril to our <span class="t18">[5.251] </span>kind be threatening us?&rdquo; Then a sage amongst them thought: &ldquo;I am not satisfied with what Ānanda is doing: I will investigate what he is about,&rdquo; and when the fish came to pay homage to Ānanda, the sage hid himself in the lobe of Ānanda&rsquo;s ear. Ānanda on dismissing the fish devoured those that were straggling behind. The wise fish seeing it reported it to the others and they all were panic-stricken and fled.</p>
<p class="p7">From that day Ānanda in his greedy longing for the flavour of fish refused every other kind of food. Growing sick from hunger he thought: &ldquo;Where in the world can they be gone?&rdquo; and in searching for them he espied a certain mountain and thought: &ldquo;From fear of me the fish, I think, are dwelling near this mountain. I will encircle it and keep a watch over it.&rdquo; So encircling it with his head and tail he compassed it on both sides, thinking: &ldquo;If they live here, they will be for escaping,&rdquo; and catching sight of his own tail as it coiled round the mountain he thought: &ldquo;This fish lives near the mountain and is trying to elude me,&rdquo; and in his rage he seized his own tail, which was fifty leagues long, and believing he had got hold of a fish, he devoured it with a crunching sound, suffering thereby excruciating pain. At the smell of the blood the fish gathered together, and pulling bit after bit out of Ānanda&rsquo;s tail ate it up till they reached his head. <span class="t18">{5.464}</span> Having such a big carcase he could not turn round but then and there came to his end. And there was a heap of bones as big as a mountain. Holy ascetics, male and female, travelling through space, saw it and told men of it. And the inhabitants of all Jambudīpa knew of it. Kāḷahatthi, by way of illustration, told this story and said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Ānanda ate of every fish and when his suite had fled,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He his own tail right greedily devoured till he was dead.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. The slave to appetite no other pleasure knows,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Poor careless fool, so blind is he to coming woes:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He children, kith and kin in ruin low will lay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then turns and rends himself, to monstrous greed a prey.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. To these my words, O king, I pray you, hearken well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eat not the flesh of men; forego your purpose fell:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lest you perchance should share that fish&rsquo;s awful fate</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And leave, O lord of men, your kingdom desolate.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.465}</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx29990"></a>The Landowner Sujāta, 1</h4>
<p class="p7">On hearing this the king said: &ldquo;Kāḷahatthi, I too know an example as well as you,&rdquo; and as an instance he told a story of the past in illustration of his greed for human flesh and said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;Sujāta&rsquo;s son and heir for some Jambu plums loudly cried,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For loss of them the lad so grieved, he laid him down and died.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. So, Kāḷa, I who now long time have fed on daintiest fare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Failing this human flesh, I think, for life would cease to care.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">In the past, they say, a landed gentleman named Sujāta at Benares lodged in his park and ministered to five hundred ascetics who had come down from the Himālayas to procure salt and vinegar. Food <span class="t18">[5.252] </span>was constantly set out in his house for them, but these ascetics sometimes went on a pilgrimage for alms in the country and brought back pieces of big Jambu plums to eat. When they were feeding on the Jambu plums they had brought, Sujāta thought: &ldquo;Today it is the third or fourth day that these holy men have not come to me here. Where in the world can they have gone?&rdquo; So making his little boy take hold of his hand he went there while they were taking their repast. At that moment a novice was giving the elders water to rinse their mouths and was eating a bit of Jambu plum. Sujāta saluted the ascetics and when he was seated he asked, saying: &ldquo;Venerable sirs, what are you eating?&rdquo; &ldquo;Pieces of large Jambu plums, sir.&rdquo; The boy on hearing this felt thirsty, so the leader of the company of ascetics had a small piece given to him. The boy ate it and was so charmed with the delicate flavour that he kept on continually begging them to give him another piece. The gentleman, who was listening to the preaching of the Dhamma, said: &ldquo;Do not cry; when you get home, you shall have a piece to eat,&rdquo; thus deceiving the boy for fear lest the holy monks might be worn out by his cries. So comforting the boy he took his leave of the band of ascetics and returned home. From the moment they arrived there the boy kept up a cry of &ldquo;Give me a piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The ascetics too said: &ldquo;We have stayed here a long time,&rdquo; and departed for the Himālayas. Not finding the boy in the park the ascetics sent him a present of pieces of mangoes, Jambu plums, breadfruit, bananas and other fruits, all mixed with powdered sugar. This mixture was no sooner placed on the tip of his tongue than it acted like a deadly poison. For seven days he took no food and then died. <span class="t18">{5.466}</span> This story the king told by way of illustration.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx29999"></a>The Son of a Brahmin</h4>
<p class="p7">Then Kāḷahatthi thought: &ldquo;This king is a great glutton: I will tell him further instances,&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;Great king, desist from this.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Should you not desist, you will gradually be dropped by your family circle and deprived of your kingly glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">In the past too in this very Benares there was a brahmin family which kept the Five Precepts. An only son was born to this family, the darling and delight of his parents, a wise lad and well versed in the Three Vedas. He used to go about in the company of a band of youths of the same age as himself. The other members of the company ate fish, meat and similar food and took strong drink. The young boy neither ate meat nor drank strong drink.</p>
<p class="p7">The thought struck them, &ldquo;This boy because he takes no strong drink does not pay his reckoning: let us devise a plan to make him drink.&rdquo; So when they were gathered together, they said: &ldquo;My friend, let us hold a festival.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;You drink strong drink but I do not. You go without me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Friend, we will take some milk for you to drink.&rdquo; He consented, saying: &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; The rogues went to the garden and tied up some fiery spirit in a leaf cup and put it amongst some lotus leaves. So when they began to drink they <span class="t18">[5.253] </span>offered the lad some milk. One of the rogues cried, &ldquo;Bring us some lotus nectar,&rdquo; and having had it brought to him, he cut a hole in the bottom of the leaf cup placed in the lotus, and putting it to his mouth sucked it. The others too had some brought to them and drank it. The lad asked what it was and took some strong drink, believing it to be lotus nectar. Then they offered him some broiled meat and this too he ate. And when from repeated draughts of liquor he was intoxicated, they told him, &ldquo;This is no lotus nectar: it is spirit.&rdquo; &ldquo;All this long while,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I never knew what a sweet taste was. Bring me more strong drink, I say!&rdquo; They brought it and once more gave it him, for he was very thirsty. <span class="t18">{5.467}</span> Then when he asked for more, they told him it was all finished. He said: &ldquo;Come, I say! Fetch me some more,&rdquo; and gave them his signet ring. After drinking with them all the day, being now quite drunk and his eyes bloodshot, trembling and babbling, he went home and lay down.</p>
<p class="p7">Then his father finding out he had been drinking, when the effects of it had passed off, said to him, &ldquo;My son, you have done very wrong, being a member of a brahmin family, to drink strong drink: never do so again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear father, what is my offence?&rdquo; &ldquo;Drinking strong drink.&rdquo; &ldquo;How say you, father? In all my life I never before tasted anything so sweet.&rdquo; The brahmin repeatedly besought him to give it up. &ldquo;I cannot do it,&rdquo; he said. Then the brahmin thought: &ldquo;If this is so, our family tradition will be destroyed and our wealth will perish,&rdquo; and he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;A scion of a brahmin house, withal a comely boy,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You must not drink the accursèd thing no brahmin may enjoy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And after these words he said: &ldquo;My dear son, abstain from it, otherwise I shall put you out of my house and have you banished from my kingdom.&rdquo; The lad said: &ldquo;Even so, I cannot give up strong drink,&rdquo; and he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;Since, father, from this best of tastes you fain would me debar,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To get it, where it may be found I&rsquo;ll go however far.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. Depart will I in haste and ne&rsquo;er dwell with you any more,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For now the very sight of me, I think, you do abhor.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Moreover he said: &ldquo;I will not abstain from dram drinking: do what you please.&rdquo; Then the brahmin, saying: &ldquo;Well, as you give us up, we too will give you up,&rdquo; repeated this verse:<span class="t18"> {5.468}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;Surely some other sons we&rsquo;ll find as heirs our wealth to claim,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Go, rascal, where we never more may hear your cursèd name.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then taking his son into court he disinherited him and had him driven out of his house. This youth later on, being a poor destitute wretch, put on a coarse garment, and taking a beggar&rsquo;s bowl in his hand he went round begging for alms, and resting against a wall so died. Kāḷahatthi relating <span class="t18">[5.254] </span>this incident by way of a lesson to the king, said: &ldquo;If, sire, you refuse to hearken to our words, they will have you banished from the kingdom,&rdquo; and so saying he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;So hearken well, O king of men, obeying my command,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or like that drunken youth will you be banished from the land.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx30018"></a>The Landowner Sujāta, 2</h4>
<p class="p7">Even after the instance thus adduced by Kāḷahatthi, the king could not desist from his habit, and to illustrate yet another story he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12969"></a><span class="t12">18. &ldquo;Disciple of the Perfect Saints,</span><a id="a12970"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17181"><span class="t19">{1410}</span></a><span class="t12"> Sujāta, it is said,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Abstained from food and drink through love felt for a heavenly maid.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. As dewdrop on a blade of grass to waters of the sea,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is human love compared with love for some divinity.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. So, Kāḷa, I who now long time have fed on daintiest fare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Failing this human flesh, I think, for life would cease to care.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12971"></a>The story is just like the one already related above. This Sujāta, they say, on seeing that the ascetics, at the time when they ate pieces of big Jambu plum did not return, thought: &ldquo;I wonder why they do not come back. If they are gone anywhere, I will find it out: otherwise I will listen to their preaching.&rdquo; So he went to the park and heard the Dhamma preached by the leader of the company, and when the sun set, though he was dismissed he said: &ldquo;I will remain here today,&rdquo; and saluting the company of saints he went into his hut of leaves and lay down.</p>
<p class="p7">At night Sakka, king of heaven, accompanied by a troop of angelic beings, together with his handmaids, came to pay his respects to the band of ascetics, and the whole hermitage was one blaze of light. Sujāta, wondering what this might be, rose up and looking through a chink in his hut of leaves, saw Sakka come to salute the company, <span class="t18">{5.469}</span><a id="a12972"></a> attended by a troop of Accharā, and no sooner did he see them than he was fired with passion. Sakka took a seat and after listening to a sermon on the faith departed to his own abode.</p>
<p class="p7">The landed proprietor next day saluted the ascetics and asked, saying: &ldquo;Who was it, venerable sirs, came in the night to pay his respects to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sakka, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;And who were those that sat round about him?&rdquo; &ldquo;They are called Devaccharās<a id="a12973"></a>.&rdquo; Saluting the band of ascetics he went home and from the moment he got there he kept up a foolish cry of &ldquo;Give me a Devaccharā.&rdquo; His kinsmen, standing about him, wondered if he were possessed of an evil spirit, and snapped their fingers. He said: &ldquo;It is not this snapping of the fingers I speak of, but of the Devaccharā.&rdquo;<a id="a12974"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17183"><span class="t9">{1411}</span></a> And when they dressed up and brought to him a wife or even a courtesan and said: &ldquo;Here is a Devaccharā,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;This is no Devaccharā, it is a female ghoul,&rdquo; and went on with his <span class="t18">[5.255] </span>foolish cry, &ldquo;Give me a Devaccharā,&rdquo; and taking no food he died.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx30031"></a>The Golden Geese</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12975"></a>On hearing this Kāḷahatthi said: &ldquo;This king is a great glutton: I will bring him to a better mind.&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;The golden geese too that fly through the air perished from eating the flesh of their kin,&rdquo; and to illustrate this he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. &ldquo;Just as these Dhataraṭtha geese that travel through the air</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All died because they lived upon a most unnatural fare,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. So too do you, O king of men, list well to what I say,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For eating this unlawful food, you too they&rsquo;ll drive away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12976"></a>In the past, they say, ninety thousand geese dwelt in the Golden Cave on mount Cittakūṭa. For four months in the rainy season they do not stir out. If they should do so, their wings being full of water, they would be unable to take a long flight and would fall into the sea, and therefore they do not stir out, but when the rainy season is drawing near, they gather wild paddy from a natural lake, and filling their cave with it live upon rice. But no sooner had they entered the cave than an spinning spider as big as a chariot wheel at the entrance of the cave used to spin a web every month, and each thread of it was as thick as a cow&rsquo;s halter. The geese give two portions of food to a young goose, thinking he will then be able to break through the web. <span class="t18">{5.470}</span> When the sky clears, this young goose being in front of them severed the web and the rest all escape by the same way.</p>
<p class="p7">Now once the rainy season lasted five months, and the food of the geese grew short. They consulted as to what was to be done and said: &ldquo;If we are to live, we must take the eggs.&rdquo; First they ate the eggs, then the goslings and after that the old geese. At the end of five months the rain left off, the spider had spun five webs, and the geese from eating the flesh of their kin had grown feeble. The young goose that had received a double portion of food, striking at the webs broke four of them but could not break the fifth, and stuck there. So the spider cut off his head and drank his blood. First one and then another came and struck the web, and the spider said: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another of them stuck in the same place,&rdquo; and sucked the blood of all of them, and at that time the family of the Dhataraṭṭha geese became extinct, they say.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx30040"></a>The Exile</h4>
<p class="p7">The king was anxious to give yet another illustration, but the citizens rising up said: &ldquo;My lord commander, what do you propose to do? How will you proceed now you have caught the man-eating rogue? If he does not give it up, have him expelled from his kingdom,&rdquo; and they would not suffer the king to say a word. Hearing the common talk of the people, the king was terrified and could say nothing more, and once again the commander said to him, &ldquo;Sire, will it be possible for you to give it up?&rdquo; &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; he said. So the commander placed on one side all his harem, his sons and his daughters, arrayed in all their splendour, and said: &ldquo;Sire, behold this circle of your kinsfolk, this band of councillors <span class="t18">[5.256] </span>and your royal pomp: be not undone, but cease from eating man&rsquo;s flesh.&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;All this is not dearer to me than man&rsquo;s flesh.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then depart, sire, from this city and kingdom.&rdquo; &ldquo;Kāḷahatthi,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I do not want my kingdom; I am ready to depart, but grant me one favour; let me have my sword and my cook.&rdquo; So they let him take a sword, a vessel for cooking man&rsquo;s flesh and a basket, and giving him his cook they carried out his expulsion from the kingdom. <span class="t18">{5.471}</span> Taking his cook he set out from the city and entered a forest and made his dwelling at the foot of a banyan tree.</p>
<p class="p7">Living there he would take his stand on the road which led through the forest, and killing men he would bring their bodies and give them to the cook, and he cooked the flesh and served it up and both of them lived after this manner. And when he sallied forth, crying, &ldquo;Here am I, the man-eating robber!&rdquo; no one could hold his own, and they all fell to the ground and any one of them that he fancied, he seized, heels upwards or not as it might happen, and gave him to his cook.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, he did not find any man in the forest, and when on his return the cook said: &ldquo;How is this, sire?&rdquo; he told him to put the pot on the brazier. &ldquo;But where is the meat, sire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! I will find some meat,&rdquo; he said. Thought the cook, &ldquo;I am a dead man,&rdquo; and all of a tremble he made a fire and put the pot on the brazier. Then the man-eater killed him with a stroke of his sword and cooked and ate his flesh. Thenceforth he was quite alone and had to cook his food himself. The rumour spread throughout all Jambudīpa: &ldquo;The man-eater murders wayfaring men.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx30044"></a>The Caravan Leader</h4>
<p class="p7">At that time a certain wealthy brahmin who traded with five hundred wagons was travelling from the east in a westerly direction and he thought: &ldquo;This man-eating robber, they say, murders men on the road. By a payment of money I will make my way through the forest.&rdquo; So he paid a thousand pieces of money to the people who lived at the entrance of the forest, bidding them convoy him safely through it and set out on the road with them. He placed all his caravan in front of him, and having bathed and anointed himself and put on sumptuous apparel he seated himself in an easy carriage drawn by white oxen, and escorted by his convoy he travelled last of all.</p>
<p class="p7">The man-eater climbing up a tree was on the look out for men, but though he felt no appetite for any of the rest of the convoy, no sooner did he catch sight of the brahmin than his mouth watered through desire to eat him. When the brahmin came up to him, <span class="t18">{5.472}</span> he proclaimed his name, crying, &ldquo;Here am I, the man-eating robber,&rdquo; and brandishing his sword, like to one filling men&rsquo;s eyes with sand, he leaped upon them and no man was able to stand up against him, but they all fell prone upon the ground. Seizing the brahmin as he sat in his easy carriage by the foot he slung him on his back, head downwards, and striking his head against his heels so carried him off. The men rising up cried one to another, &ldquo;Ho! My man, bestir yourself. We received a thousand pieces of money from the <span class="t18">[5.257]</span> brahmin&rsquo;s hands. Who amongst us wears the semblance of a man? Let us, one and all, strong man or weakling, pursue him for a short space.&rdquo; They pursued him and the man-eater stopped and looked back, and not seeing anyone went slowly on.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12977"></a>At that moment a bold fellow running at full speed came up with him. On seeing him, the robber leaping over a fence trod upon an acacia splinter<a id="a12978"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17185"><span class="t9">{1412}</span></a> which, wounding him, came out at the top of his foot, and the robber went limping along with the blood trickling from the wound. Then his pursuer on seeing it said: &ldquo;Surely I have wounded him: you just follow on behind and I will catch him.&rdquo; They saw how feeble he was and joined in the pursuit. When the robber saw that he was pursued he dropped the brahmin and secured his own safety. The brahmin&rsquo;s escort as soon as they had recovered him thought: &ldquo;What have we got to do with this robber?&rdquo; and turned back.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12979"></a><a id="a12980"></a>But the man-eater, going to the foot of his banyan tree, lay down amongst the shoots and offered up a prayer to the spirit of the tree, saying: &ldquo;My lady, Tree Devatā, if within seven days you can heal my wound, I will bathe your trunk with blood from the throats of one hundred and one princes from all Jambudīpa, and will hang the tree all round with their inwards and offer up a sacrifice of the five sweet kinds of flesh.&rdquo; Now, in consequence of having nothing to eat or drink, his body wasted away, and within the seven days his wound healed. He recognised that his cure was due to the Tree Devatā, and in a few days he recovered his strength by eating man&rsquo;s flesh and thought: &ldquo;The Devatā has been very helpful to me. I will discharge my vow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Taking his sword he sallied forth from the foot of the tree <span class="t18">{5.473}</span> and set out, purposing to bring the kings. Now, a Yakkha which had gone about as his comrade, eating man&rsquo;s flesh with him, when in a former existence he himself had been a Yakkha, caught sight of him and knowing that he had in a former existence been his friend he asked him, saying: &ldquo;Do you not recognise me, friend?&rdquo; &ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; he said. Then he told him about something they had done in a former state and the man-eater recognised him and gave him a kind greeting. When asked where he had been reborn, he told him of his place of birth and how he had been banished from his kingdom and where he was now living. He told him moreover how he was wounded by a splinter and that he was now going on an expedition to redeem his promise to the Devatā. &ldquo;I must get over this difficulty of mine by your help: we will go together, my friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I cannot go, but there is one service I can render you. I certainly know a spell characterised by words of priceless value. It ensures strength, speed of foot, and an increase of prestige. Learn this spell.&rdquo; He readily agreed to <span class="t18">[5.258] </span>this, and the Yakkha gave it to him and went off.</p>
<p class="p7">The man-eater got the spell by heart, and from that time became swift as the wind and very bold. Within seven days he found a hundred and one kings on their ways to parks and other places and leapt upon them with the swiftness of the wind, proclaiming his name, and by jumping about and shouting he greatly terrified them. Then he seized them by the feet and held them head downwards, and striking their heads with his heels carried them off with the swiftness of the wind. Next he drilled holes in the palms of their hands and hung them up by a cord on the banyan tree, and the wind striking them as they just touched the ground with the tips of their toes, they hung on the tree, revolving like withered wreaths of flowers in baskets.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx30051"></a>Sutasoma</h4>
<p class="p7">But he thought: &ldquo;Sutasoma was my private teacher: let not Jambudīpa be altogether desolate,&rdquo; and did not bring him. Being minded to make an offering to the tree he lighted a fire and sat down, sharpening a stake. The Tree Devatā on seeing this thought: &ldquo;He is preparing to offer sacrifice to me, but it was not I that healed his wound: <span class="t18">{5.474}</span><a id="a12981"></a> he will now make a great slaughter. What is to be done? I shall not be able to stop him.&rdquo; So she went and told the Four Great Kings of it and bade them stop him. When they said they could not do it, she approached Sakka and told him the whole story and asked him to stop him. He said: &ldquo;I cannot do it, but I will tell you someone who can.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; &ldquo;In the world of men and gods,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;there is no one else, but in the city of Indapatta in the Kuru kingdom is Sutasoma, prince of Kuru. He will tame and humble this man and will save the lives of these kings, and cure him of eating human flesh and will shower nectar over all Jambudīpa. If you are anxious to save the lives of the kings, bid him first bring Sutasoma and then offer his sacrifice to the tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the Tree Devatā and went quickly, disguised as an ascetic, and approached the man-eater.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12982"></a>At the sound of footsteps he thought: &ldquo;Can one of the kings have escaped?&rdquo; Looking up and seeing him he thought: &ldquo;Ascetics surely are nobles. If I capture him, I shall make up the full number of one hundred and one kings and offer my sacrifice.&rdquo;<a id="a12983"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17187"><span class="t9">{1413}</span></a> He rose up and sword in hand pursued the ascetic, but though he chased him for three leagues he could not overtake him, and streams of sweat poured from his limbs. He thought: &ldquo;I once could pursue and catch an elephant, or horse, or chariot going at full speed, but today though I am running with all my might I cannot catch this ascetic who is going just his natural pace. What can be the reason for this?&rdquo; Then thinking: &ldquo;Ascetics are accustomed to obey: if I bid him stand and he does so, I shall catch him,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Stand, venerable sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am standing,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;do you too try and <span class="t18">[5.259] </span><a id="a12984"></a>stand.&rdquo; Then he said: &ldquo;Ho there! Ascetics even to save their life do not tell a lie, but you speak falsely,&rdquo; and he repeated this verse: <span class="t18">{5.475}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. &ldquo;Although I bid you stand, you still do forward fly,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And crying &lsquo;Lo! I stand,&rsquo; I think you do but lie:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unseemly &rsquo;tis; this sword, O monk, you must assume</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12985"></a><span class="t12">To be a harmless shaft equipped with heron&rsquo;s plume.&rdquo;</span><a id="a12986"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17189"><span class="t19">{1414}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">Then the nymph spoke a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. &ldquo;Steadfast in righteousness am I,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor change my name or family,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here robbers but brief moment dwell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Soon doomed to pass to woes of hell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. Be bold and captive here great Sutasoma bring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And by his sacrifice shall you heaven win, O king.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12987"></a>With such words the Devatā put off her disguise as an ascetic and stood revealed in her own form, blazing in the sky like the sun. The man-eater hearing what she had to say and beholding her form asked who she was, and on her replying that she had come to life as the Tree Devatā, he was delighted and thinking: &ldquo;I have looked upon my tutelary divinity,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;O heavenly sovereign, be not troubled by reason of Sutasoma, <span class="t18">{5.476}</span> but enter once more into thine own tree.&rdquo; The Devatā entered into the tree before his very eyes. At that moment the sun set and the moon arose.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12988"></a>The man-eater being versed in the Vedas and their auxiliaries and acquainted with the movements of the astral bodies, looking at the sky, thought: &ldquo;Tomorrow it will be the Phussa asterism; Sutasoma will come to the park to bathe and then will I lay hands upon him. But as he will have a strong guard and the dwellers throughout all Jambudīpa will come to guard him for three leagues around, at the first watch, before the guard is posted, I will go to the Migācira park and descend into the royal tank and there take my stand.&rdquo; So he went down into the tank and stood there, covering his head with a lotus leaf.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12989"></a>By reason of his great glory the fish, turtles and the like fell back and swam about in large bodies at the water&rsquo;s edge. Whence, it may be asked, came this glory of his? From his devotion in a former existence. For at the time of Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, he started a distribution of milk by ticket. Owing to this he became very mighty, and having got the Saṅgha of the monks to erect a hall for a fire to dispel the cold, he provided fire, firewood and an axe to cleave the wood. As the result of this he became famous.</p>
<p class="p7">So now when he had gone into the garden, while it was still early dawn, they picked a guard for three leagues round about, and king Sutasoma quite early in the morning after breakfast, mounted on a richly caparisoned elephant, with a complete force of four arms, sallied from the city.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx30070"></a>The Brahmin Nanda</h4>
<p class="p7">At that very moment a brahmin named Nanda from Taxila, <span class="t18">[5.260] </span>bringing with him four verses, each worth a hundred pieces of money, reached the city after a journey of one hundred and twenty leagues, and took up his abode in a suburb. At sunrise on entering the city he saw the king issuing forth by the eastern gate, and raising his hand he cried, &ldquo;Victory to the king.&rdquo; Now the king being far-sighted, as he was riding along, saw the outstretched hand of the brahmin as he stood on some rising ground, and drawing nigh to him on his elephant he spoke after this manner:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. &ldquo;Born in what realm and why, I pray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do hither come, O brahmin, say; </span><span class="t18">{5.477}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This said, today I grant to you</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your prayer, whatever it may be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the brahmin answered him:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. &ldquo;Four verses, mighty king, to you</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of import deep as is the sea</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I hither bring; list to them well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Secrets of highest worth they tell.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12990"></a>&ldquo;Great king,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;these four verses taught me by Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, are worth a hundred pieces of money each, and having heard that you take pleasure in libations<a id="a12991"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17191"><span class="t9">{1415}</span></a> of soma juice, I am come to teach you.&rdquo; The king was greatly pleased and said: &ldquo;Teacher, in this you have done well, but it is impossible for me to turn back. Today, because it is the Phussa conjunction, it is the day for bathing my head: when I return I will listen to you. Be not dissatisfied with me.&rdquo; And with these words he bade his councillors, saying: &ldquo;Go you and in a certain house of a brahmin prepare a couch and arrange a dining place under cover,&rdquo; and he retired into his park.</p>
<p class="p7">This was girt about by a wall eighteen cubits high and guarded all round by elephants within touch of one another. Then came horses, then chariots, and finally archers and other foot-soldiers &ndash; like a mighty troubled ocean was the army that had been transported there. The king, when he had put off his heavy adornments and had been shaved and shampooed, bathed in all his royal majesty in the lotus tank, and coming up out of the water he stood there clad in bathing garments, and they brought him scented garlands to adorn him.</p>
<p class="p7">The man-eater thought: &ldquo;When he is fully dressed, the king must be a heavy weight. I will seize him just when he is light to carry.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{5.478}</span><a id="a12992"></a> So shouting and jumping about and whirling a sword above his head as quick as lightning he proclaimed his name, crying, &ldquo;Ho! Here am I, the man-eating robber,&rdquo; and he laid his finger on his forehead<a id="a12993"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17193"><span class="t9">{1416}</span></a> and stepped out of the water. As soon as they heard his cry, the elephant-riders with their elephants, the horsemen with their horses, and the charioteers with their chariots fell to the ground, and all the host of them dropping the weapons they held lay <span class="t18">[5.261] </span>prone upon their bellies.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12994"></a>The man-eater seized Sutasoma, holding him erect. The rest of the kings he had caught by the foot and held head downwards and had gone off with them, knocking their heads against his heels, but in coming up to the Bodhisatta he stooped down and lifting him up placed him on his shoulders. Thinking it would be a roundabout way by the gate he leaped over the wall, eighteen cubits high, at the point where it faced him, and going forward he trampled on the temples of elephants exuding the juice of rut, overthrowing them as it were mountain peaks. Next he trod on the backs of the horses &ndash; swift as the wind were they and of priceless worth &ndash; laying them also low. Then as he stepped on the fronts of the splendid chariots, he was like to one whirling a humming top<a id="a12995"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17195"><span class="t9">{1417}</span></a><a id="a12996"></a> or as it were one crushing the dark green phalaka<a id="a12997"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17197"><span class="t9">{1418}</span></a> plant or banyan leaves, and at a single burst he ran a distance of three leagues. Then wondering if anyone were following to rescue Sutasoma, he looked and seeing no one he went on slowly.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx30085"></a>The Dialogue</h4>
<p class="p7">Noticing the drops that fell upon him from Sutasoma&rsquo;s hair he thought: &ldquo;There is no man living free from the fear of death, Sutasoma, too, I think, is weeping from fear,&rdquo; and he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">28. &ldquo;Men versed in lore, in whom high thoughts arise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Such never weep, the learned and the wise;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All find herein a refuge and a stay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That sages thus can sorrow drive away.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">29. Is it your kin, wife, child, perchance thyself,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12998"></a><span class="t12">Your stores of grain, your gold and silver pelf &ndash; </span><span class="t18">{5.479}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What, Sutasoma, caused your tears to flow?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Great Kuru lord, your answer we would know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sutasoma said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">30. &ldquo;Nay, I no tears am shedding for myself,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor for my wife or child, my realm or pelf.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The practice of the saints of old I keep,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And for a promise unfulfilled I weep.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">31. Once to a brahmin I my word did plight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What time in mine own realm I ruled with might;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That plighted word I fain would keep and then,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My honour saved, return to you again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the man-eater said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">32. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not believe if any one should be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By happy chance from jaws of death set free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He would return to yield him to his foe;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No more would you, if I should let you go. </span><span class="t18">{5.480}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">33. Escaped from fierce man-eater should you come,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Full of sweet longings, to your royal home,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dear life with all its charms restored to you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why in the world should you come back to me?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.262]</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the Great Being, like a lion still fearless, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">34. &ldquo;If innocent, a man would death prefer</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To life o&rsquo;erclouded with some odious slur;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should he, to save his life, a falsehood tell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">It may not shield him from the woes of hell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12999"></a><span class="t12">35. The wind</span><a id="a13000"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17199"><span class="t19">{1419}</span></a><span class="t12"> may sooner move some mountain high,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or sun and moon to earth fall from the sky,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea, rivers all up stream may flow, my lord,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ere I be guilty of one lying word.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Though he spoke thus, the man-eater still did not believe him. So the Bodhisatta, thinking: &ldquo;He does not believe me; by means of an oath I will make him believe,&rdquo; said: &ldquo;Good mister man-eater, let me down from your back and I will take an oath and make you believe me.&rdquo; After these words he was let down by the man-eater and placed upon the ground, and in taking an oath he said: <span class="t18">{5.481}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. &ldquo;Lo! As I touch this spear and sword</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To you I pledge my solemn word,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Release me and I will debt-free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My honour saved, return to thee.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the man-eater thought: &ldquo;This Sutasoma swears under penalty of violating noble rules. What do I want with him? Well, I too am a noble king. I will take blood from my own arm and make an offering to the Tree Devatā. This is a very faint-hearted fellow.&rdquo; And he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. &ldquo;The word you once did to a brahmin plight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What time in thine own realm you ruled with might,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That plighted word I bid you keep and then,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your honour saved, return to me again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being said: &ldquo;My friend, do not vex yourself. After I have heard the four verses, each worth a hundred pieces of money, and have made an offering to the preacher of the Dhamma, I will return at daybreak.&rdquo; And he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. &ldquo;The word I once did to a brahmin plight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What time in mine own realm I ruled with might,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That plighted word I first will keep and then,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My honour saved, return to you again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the man-eater said: &ldquo;You have taken an oath under penalty of violating the custom of nobles. See that you act accordingly.&rdquo; &ldquo;My man-eating friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have known me from a boy: never even in jest have I previously told a lie, and now that I am established on the throne and know right and wrong, why should I lie? Trust me, <span class="t18">{5.482}</span> I will provide an offering for you.&rdquo; Being induced to believe him he said: &ldquo;Well, sire, depart, and, if you do not return, there can be no offering and <span class="t18">[5.263] </span>the Tree Devatā does not agree to it without you: do not place any obstacle in the way of my offering,&rdquo; and he let the Great Being go.</p>
<p class="p7">Like the moon escaped from the jaws of Rāhu and with the strength of a young elephant he speedily reached the city. And his soldiers thought: &ldquo;King Sutasoma is wise and a sweet preacher of the Dhamma. If he can have a word or two with him he will convert the man-eater and will return, like a furious elephant escaping from the lion&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo; And thinking: &ldquo;The people will chide us and say, &ldquo;After giving up your king to the man-eater are you come back to us?&rdquo; they remained encamped outside the city walls, and when they saw him coming from afar off they went out to meet him and saluting him with a friendly greeting they asked, &ldquo;Were you not, sire, heartily sick of the man-eater?&rdquo; &ldquo;The man-eater,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did something far harder than anything my parents ever did. For being such a fierce and violent creature, after listening to my preaching of the Dhamma, he let me go.&rdquo; Then they decked out the king and mounting him on an elephant escorted him into the city.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx30143"></a>The Four Verses</h4>
<p class="p7">On seeing him the inhabitants rejoiced, and owing to his zeal for the Dhamma, he did not visit his parents but thinking: &ldquo;I will see them by and by,&rdquo; he entered his palace and took his seat upon his throne. Then he summoned the brahmin and gave orders for him to be shaved, and when his hair and beard had been trimmed and he was washed and anointed and decked out with brave apparel, they brought him to the king. And when the brahmin was presented, Sutasoma himself afterwards took a bath and ordered his own food to be given to the brahmin, and when he had eaten he himself partook of the food. Then he seated the brahmin on a costly throne and to mark his reverence for him he made offerings of scented garlands and the like to him, and seating himself on a low seat he prayed him, saying: &ldquo;Teacher, we would hear the verses which you have brought to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">To throw light upon this the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">39. &ldquo;Released from fierce man-eater&rsquo;s hand he flies</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To brahmin friend and &lsquo;Fain would we,&rsquo; he cries, </span><span class="t18">{5.483}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&lsquo;Hear verses worth a hundred pieces each,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Us for our good if you would deign to teach.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The brahmin, when the Bodhisatta made his request, after shampooing his hands with perfumes, pulling a beautiful book out of a bag took it in both hands and said: &ldquo;Well, sire, listen to my four verses, each worth a hundred pieces of money; they were taught me by Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, and are destructive of passion, pride and similar vices, and procure for man the removal of desire, the cessation of the faculties, even the eternal mighty Nibbāna, to the decay of lust, the cutting of the circle of transmigration <span class="t18">[5.264] </span>and the rooting out of attachment,&rdquo; and with these words, looking at his book, he repeated these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13001"></a><a id="a13002"></a><span class="t12">40. &ldquo;In union with the saints just once, O Sutasoma, be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And ne&rsquo;er consort with evil men and peace shall compass you.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">41. With holy men consorting aye, as friends such only know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From holy men true Dhamma learn and daily better grow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">42. As painted cars of royalty wax dim and fade away,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So too our bodies frail wear out and suffer swift decay.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But Dhamma of holy men abides and never waxes old,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Good men proclaim it to the good through ages yet untold.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">43. The sky above us stretches far, far stretches earth below,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And lands beyond the boundless sea far distant are we know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But greater still than all of these and wider in its reach</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is Dhamma whether good or bad that saints or sinners preach.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.484}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the brahmin teach him the four verses, each worth a hundred pieces, just as he had been taught them by Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, and then remained silent. The Great Being was delighted at hearing them and said: &ldquo;My journey here is not without its reward,&rdquo; and thinking, &ldquo;these verses are not merely the words of a disciple or a saint nor the work of a poet, but were spoken by the Omniscient One; I wonder what they are worth. Though one were to give a whole world that extends to the Brahmā Realm, after filling it with the seven precious things, one could not make an adequate return for these verses. Surely I can give him sovereignty in the city of Indapatta covering seven leagues in the realm of Kuru, which extends over three hundred leagues. Doubtless it is his merited fate to be king.&rdquo; But regarding him with the power he possessed of divining a man&rsquo;s future from his personal appearance, he found no such signs. Then he bethought him of the office of commander-in-chief and similar posts, but did not find that he was destined even to the headship of a single village. Next, considering the case of acquisition of wealth and starting from a crore of money he found he was destined to receive four thousand pieces, and thinking to honour him with just this sum he bestowed on him four purses containing a thousand pieces each and he asked him, saying: &ldquo;Teacher, when you teach other princes these verses, how much do you receive?&rdquo; &ldquo;A hundred for each one, sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so they are worth just a hundred pieces.&rdquo; The Great Being said: &ldquo;Teacher, you are ignorant of the priceless value of the goods you hawk about. Henceforth let them be considered worth a thousand pieces,&rdquo; and so saying he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">44. &ldquo;Not hundreds merely are they worth, nay thousands rather say,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So brahmin here four thousand take and, quick, with them away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then he presented him with an easy carriage <span class="t18">{5.485}</span> and gave orders to his men, saying: &ldquo;Convey this brahmin safely to his home,&rdquo; and so dismissed him. At this moment loud sounds of applause were heard and cries of &ldquo;Bravo, bravo! King Sutasoma has highly honoured these verses, deeming <span class="t18">[5.265] </span>worth a thousand pieces what was valued at a hundred.&rdquo; The king&rsquo;s parents hearing the noise asked what it meant, and on learning the true state of things, by reason of their covetousness were angry with the Great Being, but after dismissing the brahmin he went to them and stood saluting them. Then his father said: &ldquo;My son, you have escaped from the hands of one described as a fierce robber,&rdquo; and instead of expressing pleasure at seeing him, through his greed of money he asked, &ldquo;Is it true what they say, that you gave four thousand pieces of money for hearing four verses,&rdquo; and on his confessing it was so, his father repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">45. &ldquo;Verses may be worth eighty pieces each,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or e&rsquo;en a hundred may in value reach,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But, Sutasoma, you thyself must own</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A verse worth a thousand is unknown.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being, to induce him to see things in a different light, said: &ldquo;Dear father, it is not increase in wealth I desire, but increase in learning,&rdquo; and he uttered these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">46. &ldquo;Increase in holy lore I most desire</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And to the friendship of the saints aspire;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No rivers can the void of ocean fill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So I good words imbibe, insatiate still.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">47. As flames for wood and grass insatiate roar,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And seas aye fed with streams crave more and more,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">E&rsquo;en so do sages, mighty lord of lords,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Insatiate hearken to well-spoken words.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">48. If from the mouth of my own slave I e&rsquo;er</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should verses full of deepest import hear, </span><span class="t18">{5.486}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His words I would accept with honour due,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unsated still with doctrines good and true.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After having thus spoken he said: &ldquo;Do not just for the sake of money blame me. I have come here, after swearing an oath that when I had heard the Dhamma I would return. Now then I will go back to this monster; do you then accept this sovereignty,&rdquo; and handing it over to him he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">49. &ldquo;This realm is thine with all its wealth of gold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Trappings of state and joy and bliss untold.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why blame, should I from sensual pleasures fly</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And at man-eater&rsquo;s hand go forth to die?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13003"></a>At this moment the heart of the king&rsquo;s father grew hot within him and he said: &ldquo;What, my dear Sutasoma, is this you say? I will come with a complete host of all four arms<a id="a13004"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17201"><span class="t9">{1420}</span></a> and will seize the robber,&rdquo; and he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">50. &ldquo;For our defence lo! valiant soldiers come,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Some riding elephants, on chariots some,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Foot-soldiers these, these horsemen armed with bow &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Marshal our host and let us slay our foe.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.266]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then his father and mother, their eyes swimming with tears, besought him, saying: &ldquo;Go not, my son, nay, you cannot go,&rdquo; and sixteen thousand dancing girls and the rest of his suite lamented and said: &ldquo;Leaving us helpless, whither would you go, sire?&rdquo; and no one throughout the city could restrain his feelings and they said: &ldquo;He has come, they tell us, after giving a promise to the man-eater, and now <span class="t18">{5.487}</span> that he has heard four verses worth a hundred pieces each and has paid due honour to the preacher of the Dhamma and bidden farewell to his parents, he will return once more to the robber,&rdquo; and the whole city was greatly stirred. And on hearing what his father and mother said, he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">51. &ldquo;Wondrous this deed of our man-eating foe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To capture me alive and let me go.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Calling to mind his friendly acts of yore</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How can I violate the oath I swore?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13005"></a>Comforting his parents he said: &ldquo;Dear father and mother, be not anxious about me: I have wrought a virtuous action, and mastery over the desires of the six senses<a id="a13006"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17203"><span class="t9">{1421}</span></a> is no hard matter,&rdquo; and bidding farewell to his parents he admonished the rest of the people and so departed.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">52. &ldquo;Farewell to parents said, with counsel wise</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Townsmen and soldiers he did straight advise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then true to plighted word refused to lie,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And to man-eater back again did hie.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h4 class="h41"><a id="ncx30210"></a>The Return</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13007"></a>Then the man-eater thought: &ldquo;If my friend Sutasoma wishes to return, let him return, otherwise not, and let my Tree Devatā <span class="t18">{5.488}</span> do whatsoever she pleases, and I will put these princes to death and make an offering of their flesh with the five sweet things.&rdquo; So he reared a funeral pile and kindled a fire, thinking he would wait till the coal was red hot, and while he sat and sharpened his spit Sutasoma returned. Then the man-eater at the sight of him was glad at heart and asked, saying: &ldquo;My friend, have you gone and done what you wanted to do?&rdquo; The Great Being said: &ldquo;Yes, your majesty, I have heard the verses that were taught the brahmin by Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, and I paid due honour to the preacher of the Dhamma, and so I have come back, having done the thing I had to do.&rdquo; To illustrate this, he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">53. &ldquo;My word I once did to a brahmin plight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What time in mine own realm I ruled with might,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And now that I have kept my plighted word</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And saved my honour, have returned, my lord.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So slay and offer me to your sprite</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or for man&rsquo;s flesh sate your fell appetite.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.267]</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the man-eater thought: &ldquo;This king has no fear; he speaks with all the terrors of death dispelled. I wonder from whence comes this power. It can be nothing else. He says, &lsquo;I have heard the verses that Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, taught.&rsquo; This supernatural power must come from them. I will make him utter these verses in my hearing, and so will I too be free from all fear.&rdquo; And being so resolved he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">54. &ldquo;The fire still smokes: though I somewhat delay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I forfeit not the right to eat my prey.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Meat roast o&rsquo;er embers clear is roasted well;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">These strains a hundred pieces worth, come, tell.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.489}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being on hearing this thought: &ldquo;This man-eater is a sinner: I will rebuke him somewhat and by my words I will put him to shame,&rdquo; and he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">55. &ldquo;You, O man-eater, are a wicked wight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fall&rsquo;n from your throne through carnal appetite;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13008"></a><span class="t12">These verses do proclaim Dhamma to me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But how can Dhamma and Adhamma agree?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">56. To wicked robber, one whose hands are steeped in gore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whence comes Truth or Dhamma? What profits holy lore?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Even when addressed in these words the man-eater was not angry. Why was this? It was owing to the mighty power of generosity in the Great Being. So he said: &ldquo;Am I only, friend Sutasoma, unrighteous?&rdquo; and he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">57. &ldquo;The man that hunts a beast to make him savoury meat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And one that slays a man, his fellow&rsquo;s flesh to eat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Both after death in guilt are counted much the same:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then why am I alone for wickedness to blame?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the Great Being, in refuting his heresy, repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13009"></a><span class="t12">58. &ldquo;Of five-clawed things a warrior prince all witting five may eat,</span><a id="a13010"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17205"><span class="t19">{1422}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wicked are you, O king, in that you eat forbidden meat.&rdquo; </span><a id="a13011"></a><span class="t18">{5.490}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On receiving this rebuke, as he saw no other means of escape, he tried to conceal his own wrong-doing and repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">59. &ldquo;Escaped from fierce man-eater did you come</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Full of sweet longings to your royal home,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And then to foe entrust your life once more?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Well versed are you, forsooth, in astral lore!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being said: &ldquo;Friend, one like me must be well versed in the lore of nobles. I know it well, but I do not regulate my actions accordingly,&rdquo; and he spoke this verse:<span class="t18"> [5.268]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13012"></a><span class="t12">60. &ldquo;All such as are in noble Dhamma</span><a id="a13013"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17207"><span class="t19">{1423}</span></a><span class="t12"> versed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In hell are mostly doomed to life accursed.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Therefore I have all noble lore abhorred</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And here returned, true to my plighted word:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Make then your sacrifice and eat me up, dread lord.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The man-eater said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">61. &ldquo;Palatial halls, broad acres, steeds and kine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Perfumes, rich robes and many a concubine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All these as mighty lord you hold in fee &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In truth what blessing, pray you, do you see?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.491}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">62. &ldquo;Of all the sweets this world can yield to me</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">None sweeter than the joys of truth I see:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The brahmins and monks that in truth abide,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Birth, death, escaping, reach the further side.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being discourse to him of the advantages of Dhamma. Then the man-eater, regarding his face, glorious as a lotus in bloom or as the full moon, thought: &ldquo;This Sutasoma sees me preparing a pile of embers and sharpening a spit and yet does not show an atom of fear. Can this be the magic power in these verses that are worth a hundred pieces or does it arise from some other truth? I will ask him.&rdquo; And in the form of a question he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">63. &ldquo;Escaped from fierce man-eater did you come</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Full of sweet longings to your royal home,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And then once more return to meet your foe?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You, surely, prince, no fear of death can know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To keep your plighted word and worldly sensual desires forego.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Great Being in answer to him said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">64. &ldquo;As mine I countless acts of virtue claim,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My bounteous offerings are known to fame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To the next world a path I have kept clear:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who abides in Dhamma holds death in fear?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">65. As mine I countless acts of virtue claim,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My bounteous offerings are known to fame, </span><span class="t18">{5.492}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With no regrets to heaven I&rsquo;ll take my way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So sacrifice and then devour your prey.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">66. My parents have I cherished with fond care,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So sacrifice and then devour your prey.</span><span class="t18"> [5.269]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">68. To friends and kin due service I have done,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My rule was just and praise from all has won,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With no regrets to heaven I&rsquo;ll take my way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So sacrifice and then devour your prey.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">69. Gifts manifold to many I supplied,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea, monks and brahmins fully satisfied,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To the next world a path I have kept clear:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who abides in Dhamma holds death in fear?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">70. Gifts manifold to many I supplied,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea monks and brahmins fully satisfied,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With no regrets to heaven I&rsquo;ll take my way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So sacrifice and then devour your prey.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.493}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the man-eater thought: &ldquo;This king Sutasoma is a good and wise man: supposing I were to eat him, my skull would split into seven pieces, or the earth would open her mouth and swallow me up,&rdquo; and being terrified he said: &ldquo;My friend, you are not the sort of man that I ought to eat,&rdquo; and he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">71. &ldquo;He knowingly would quaff a poison cup</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or fiery snake, so fell and fierce, take up,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea into fragments seven his head would fly</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That dares to eat a man that cannot lie.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did he address the Great Being, saying: &ldquo;You are, as it were, a deadly poison, I think; who will eat you?&rdquo; and being anxious to hear those verses he besought him to tell him them, and when in order to produce a due reverence for holy things his prayer was rejected by the Great Being, on the ground that he was no proper recipient of verses of such exceptionable morality, he said: &ldquo;In all Jambudīpa there is no sage like this, for when he was released from my hand he went and heard these verses, and after paying due honour to the preacher of the Dhamma he came back again with death written on his forehead. These verses must be of transcendent excellence,&rdquo; and being still more filled with a reverent desire to hear them, he besought the Great Being and repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">72. &ldquo;Hearing the truth men soon discern betwixt the good and ill;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Perchance if heard these strains my heart with joy in truth may fill.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being thought: &ldquo;The man-eater is now eager to hear: I will reveal them to him,&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;Well then, my friend, listen carefully,&rdquo; and having gained his attention he sang the praises of these verses exactly as he was taught them by the brahmin Nanda, while the gods in the six worlds of sense all broke into one loud cry, <span class="t18">{5.494}</span> and the Devas in heaven shouted applause, and the Great Being thus proclaimed the Dhamma to the man-eater:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">74. &ldquo;In union with the saints just once, O Sutasoma, be,</span><span class="t19"> </span><span class="t18">[5.270]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And ne&rsquo;er consort with evil men and peace shall compass you.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">75. With holy men consorting aye, as friends such only know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From holy men true Dhamma learn and daily better grow.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">76. As painted cars of royalty wax dim and fade away,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So too our bodies frail wear out and suffer swift decay.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But Dhamma of holy men abides and never waxes old,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Good men proclaim it to the good through ages yet untold.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">77. The sky above us stretches far, far stretches earth below,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And lands beyond the boundless sea far distant are we know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But greater still than all of these and wider in its reach</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is Dhamma whether good or bad that saints or sinners preach.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Owing to these verses being so well delivered by the Great Being and to the fact that he himself was wise, the man-eater thought: &ldquo;These verses are, as it were, the words of an Omniscient Buddha,&rdquo; and his whole body thrilled with the five kinds of joy, and he felt a tender pity for the Bodhisatta and regarded him in the light of a father that was ready to confer on him the white umbrella of royalty.</p>
<h4 class="h40"><a id="ncx30326"></a>The Boons</h4>
<p class="p7">And he thought: &ldquo;I see no offerings of yellow gold to give to Sutasoma, but for each verse I will grant him a boon,&rdquo; and he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">78. &ldquo;Pregnant with meaning and in accents clear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your goodly words, O prince, fall on mine ear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So glad am I at heart, that I rejoice</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Four boons, good friend, to offer you for choice.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being upbraided him and said: &ldquo;What boon, forsooth, will you offer me?&rdquo; and he repeated this verse: <span class="t18">{5.495}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">79. &ldquo;One his own mortal state that fails to learn,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or good from evil, heaven from hell discern,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The slave of carnal appetite, how can</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A wretch like you know any boon for man?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">80. Suppose I say &lsquo;Grant me this boon&rsquo; and then</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You should your promised word take back again,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who that is wise would knowingly incur</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So clear a risk of quarrelling, good sir?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the man-eater said: &ldquo;He does not believe me; I will make him believe me,&rdquo; and he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">81. &ldquo;No one should claim to grant a boon and then</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His promised word, false man, take back again:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Amongst these boons, my friend, all fearless choose;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ll grant it you, though life itself I lose.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being thought: &ldquo;He has spoken like a brave fellow and will do what I tell him; I will accept his offer. But if I should choose as the very first boon that he should abstain from eating human flesh, he will be very sick at heart. I will first choose three other boons, and after that I will choose this,&rdquo; and he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13016"></a><span class="t12">82. &ldquo;Who with a saint lives face to face</span><a id="a13017"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17209"><span class="t19">{1424}</span></a><span class="t12"> ever with saint agrees,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So too a sage is ever sure a brother sage to please:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus safe and sound a hundred years I pray to see you live:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This is the first of all the boons I fain would have you give.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.496}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13018"></a>The man-eater, on hearing this, thought: &ldquo;This man, even though I have driven him from his sovereignty, now wishes long life for me, the noted robber that lusts after human flesh and would do him a mischief. Ah! He is my well-wisher.&rdquo; And he was glad at heart, not knowing that this boon had been chosen to cheat him to his good, and in granting the boon he uttered this verse: <span class="t18">[5.271]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">83. &ldquo;Who with a saint lives face to face ever with saint agrees,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So too a sage is ever sure a brother sage to please:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You fain would see me safe and sound for years twice fifty live:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lo! At your prayer this first of boons to you I gladly give.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">84. &ldquo;These warrior chiefs held captive in your hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By sprinkling hailed as kings in many a land,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">These mighty lords of earth you must not eat:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For this as second boon I next entreat.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did he in choosing a second boon gain the boon of life for over a hundred nobles, and the man-eater in granting the boon to him said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">85. &ldquo;These warrior chiefs held captive in my hand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By sprinkling hailed as kings in many a land,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">These mighty lords, I&rsquo;ll not eat them, I swear:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This second boon too grant I to your prayer.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.497}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Well, did these kings hear what they were talking about? They did not hear it all. For when the man-eater lighted a fire, for fear of any injury to the tree from the smoke and flame, he stepped back a space from it, and the Great Being conversed with him, seated in the interval between the fire and the tree, and consequently these kings did not hear all that they said, but heard only partially, and they comforted one another, saying: &ldquo;Fear not: now will Sutasoma convert the man-eater,&rdquo; and at this moment the Great Being spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">86. &ldquo;You captive hold a hundred kings and more,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All strung up by their hands and weeping sore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Restore then each to his own realm again:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This the third boon I would from you obtain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being in making his third choice choose the restoration of these nobles, each to his own kingdom. Why was this? Because the Yakkha, supposing he did not eat them, through fear of their hostility would either enslave them all and make them dwell in the forest, or would slay them and expose their dead bodies, or would bring them to the border country and sell them as slaves; and therefore he made choice as his boon of their restoration to their own kingdoms, and the man-eater in granting his request spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">87. &ldquo;I captive hold a hundred kings and more,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All strung up by their hands and weeping sore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All will I to their realms restore again:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This third boon too you shall from me obtain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Now in making his fourth choice the Bodhisatta spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">88. &ldquo;Distracted is your realm and sick with fright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In caves much people hide them from your sight.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From eating human flesh, O king, abstain:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This the fourth boon I would from you obtain.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.272] {5.498}</span></p>
<p class="p6">When he had so spoken, the man-eater clapped his hands and laughing said: &ldquo;Friend Sutasoma, what in truth is this that you say? How can I grant you this boon? If you are anxious to receive another boon, choose something else,&rdquo; and he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">89. &ldquo;Much to my taste I surely find this food;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas for this cause I hid within the wood.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How then from such delights should I abstain?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For your fourth boon, good sir, pray, choose again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being said: &ldquo;Because you love man&rsquo;s flesh, you say, &ldquo;I cannot abstain from it.&rdquo; He verily that does evil because it is pleasant is a fool,&rdquo; and he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13019"></a><span class="t12">90. &ldquo;A king</span><a id="a13020"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17211"><span class="t19">{1425}</span></a><span class="t12"> like you should not his pleasure take</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor sacrifice his life for pleasure&rsquo;s sake.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Life in its highest sense, best gift, attain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And future joys you shall by merit gain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When these words had been spoken by the Great Being, the man-eater was overcome with fear and thought: &ldquo;I can neither repudiate the choice Sutasoma has made nor abstain from human flesh. <span class="t18">{5.499}</span> What in the world am I to do?&rdquo; and with his eyes swimming in tears he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">91. &ldquo;I love man&rsquo;s flesh: you too must know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Great Sutasoma, it is so.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From it I never can abstain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Think of something else: choose again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">92. &ldquo;Whoso shall ever his own pleasure take</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And sacrifice e&rsquo;en life for pleasure&rsquo;s sake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The poison cup like drunkard will he drain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And so hereafter suffers endless pain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">93. Who knowingly shall pleasure here eschew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The arduous path of duty to pursue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As one in pain that drains the healing cup,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So he to bliss in the next world wakes up.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After he had thus spoken, the man-eater sorely lamenting repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">94. &ldquo;The five-fold joys that from our senses spring</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And parents dear and all abandoning,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For this cause came I in this wood to live;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How then can I the boon you ask for give?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">95. &ldquo;Sages in speech duplicity ne&rsquo;er show,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">True to their promise are good men, we know: </span><span class="t18">{5.500}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Choose, friend, some boon is what you said to me;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What now you say with this will scarce agree.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.273]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Once more, still weeping, the man-eater spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">96. &ldquo;Demerit, with disgrace and shame combined,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Misconduct, lust and wrong of every kind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All this, to eat man&rsquo;s flesh, I did incur:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why then should I this boon on you confer?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">97. &ldquo;No one should claim to grant a boon and then</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">His promised word, false man, take back again:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Amongst these boons, my friend, all fearless choose;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ll grant it you, though life itself I lose.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When he had thus pointed out the verse uttered in the first instance by the man-eater, to inspire him with courage to grant the boon, he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">98. &ldquo;Good men will life give up, but never right,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">True to their word e&rsquo;en in their own despite;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you should promise, best of kings, a boon,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Perfect they work and see it done right soon.</span><a id="a13021"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17213"><span class="t19">{1426}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">99. One who to save a limb rich treasure gave</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Would sacrifice a limb, his life to save, </span><span class="t18">{5.501}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea, wealth, limbs, life and all away would fling,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Right and its claims alone remembering.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being by these means establish the man-eater in the Dhamma, and now to make clear to him his own title to respect he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">100. &ldquo;One from whose lips a man Dhamma may prove,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yea all good men that will his doubts remove,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A refuge sure is he, a rest, a stay;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The wise man&rsquo;s love for him should ne&rsquo;er decay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After repeating these verses he said: &ldquo;My man-eating friend, it is not right that you should transgress the words of so excellent a master, and I, too, when you were young, acted as your private teacher and gave you much instruction, and now with all the charm of a Buddha I have repeated to you verses worth a hundred pieces each: therefore you ought to obey my words.&rdquo; On hearing this the man-eater thought: &ldquo;Sutasoma was my teacher and a learned man, and I granted him the choice of a boon. What am I to do? Death verily is a certainty in the case of an individual existence. I will not eat human flesh but will grant him the boon he asks,&rdquo; and with tears streaming front his eyes he rose up and fell at king Sutasoma&rsquo;s feet, and in granting the boon he repeated this verse: <span class="t18">{5.502}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">101. &ldquo;Sweet to my taste and pleasant is this food,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas for this cause I hid within the wood;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But if you askest me to do this thing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This boon I&rsquo;ll grant to you, my friend and king.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.274]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being said: &ldquo;So be it, friend; to one firmly grounded in moral practice, verily even death is a boon. I accept, sire, the boon you have offered me. From this very day you are established in the path of a spiritual guide, and this being so I beg this favour of you; if you have any love for me, accept, sir, the Five Precepts.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;teach me, friend, these precepts.&rdquo; &ldquo;Learn then from me, sire.&rdquo; So he saluted the Great Being with the five rests<a id="a13022"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17215"><span class="t9">{1427}</span></a> and took a seat apart, and the Great Being established him in the precepts.</p>
