<p class="p7"><a id="a6413"></a><a id="a6414"></a><span class="t15">In the present the king of Kosala gives 1,000 robes to Ven. Ānanda, who then gives 500 to monks in need, and 500 to his attendant monk, who passes them to other novices. The king asks the Buddha if this is proper, and the latter tells a story of how when he was an ascetic in a previous life he had saved the king&rsquo;s life, and had been honoured because of it. The honour was questioned, but the king stood by his decision.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;When all alone.&rdquo;</span><a id="a6416"></a><a id="a6417"></a><a id="a6418"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while living at Jetavana, about the gift of a thousand garments, how the venerable Ānanda received five hundred garments from the women of the household of the king of Kosala, and five hundred from the king himself. The circumstances have been described above, in the Sigālajātaka [Ja 152], of the Second Book.</span><a id="a6419"></a><a href="notes.html#a15299"><span class="t9">{507}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6420"></a><a id="a6421"></a><span class="t34">This was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana how elder Ānanda received a present of a thousand robes. The elder had been preaching to the ladies of the king of Kosala&rsquo;s palace as described above in the Mahāsārajātaka [Ja 92].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6422"></a><span class="t34">As he preached there in the manner described, a thousand robes, worth each a thousand pieces of money, were brought to the king. Of these the king gave five hundred to as many of his queens. The ladies put these aside and made them a present to our elder, and then the next day in their old ones went to the palace where the king took breakfast. The king remarked, &ldquo;I gave you dresses worth a thousand pieces each. Why are you not wearing them?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we have given them to the elder.&rdquo; &ldquo;Has elder Ānanda got them all?&rdquo; he asked. They said: &ldquo;Yes, he has.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Supreme Buddha,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;allows only three robes. Ānanda is doing a little trade in cloth, I suppose!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">He was angry with the elder; and after breakfast, visited him in his cell, and after greeting, sat down, with these words: &ldquo;Pray, sir, do my ladies learn or listen to your preaching?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Yes, sire; they learn what they ought, and what they ought to hear, they hear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Oh, indeed. Do they only listen, or do they make you presents of upper garments or under-garments?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Today, sire, they have given me five hundred robes worth a thousand pieces each.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;And you accepted them, sir?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Yes, sire, I did.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Why, sir, didn&rsquo;t the Teacher make some rule about three robes?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;True, sire, for every monk three robes is the rule, speaking of what he uses for himself. But no one is forbidden to accept what is offered; and that is why I took them &ndash; to give them to monks whose robes are worn out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;But when these monks get them from you, what do they do with their old ones?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Make them into a cloak.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;And what about the old cloak?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;That they turn into a shirt.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;And the old shirt?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;That serves for a coverlet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;The old coverlet?&rdquo; &ldquo;Becomes a mat.&rdquo; &ldquo;The old mat?&rdquo; &ldquo;A towel.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what about the old towel?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Sire, it is not permitted to waste the gifts of the faithful; so they chop up the old towel into bits, and mix the bits with clay, which they use for mortar in building their houses.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;A gift, sir, ought not to be destroyed, not even a towel.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">&ldquo;Well, sir king, we destroy no gifts, but all are used somehow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This conversation pleased the king so much, that he sent for the other five hundred robes which remained, and gave them to the elder. Then, after receiving his thanks, he greeted the elder in solemn state, and went his way.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The elder gave the first five hundred robes to monks whose robes were worn out. But the number of his fellow monastics was just five hundred. One of these, a young monk, was very useful to the elder; sweeping out his cell, serving him with food and drink, giving him toothbrush and water for cleansing his mouth, looking after the privies, living rooms, and sleeping rooms, and doing all that was needed for hand, foot, or back. To him, as his by right for all his great service, the elder gave all the five hundred robes which he had received afterwards. The young monk in his turn distributed them among his fellow-students. These all cut them up, dyed them yellow as a kaṇikāra flower; then dressed therein they waited upon the Teacher, greeted him, and sat down on one side.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6423"></a><span class="t34">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they asked, &ldquo;is it possible for a holy disciple who has entered on the First Path to be a respecter of persons in his gifts?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, monks, it is not possible for holy disciples to be respecters of persons in their gifts.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, our spiritual teacher, the Treasurer of the Dhamma, gave five hundred robes, each worth a thousand pieces, to a young monk; and he has divided them amongst us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Monks, in giving these Ānanda was no respecter of persons. That young fellow was a very useful servant; so he made the present to his own attendant for the sake of his service, for goodness&rsquo; sake, and by right, thinking that one good turn deserves another, and with a wish to do what gratitude demands. In former days, as now, wise men acted on the principle one good turn deserves another.&rdquo; And then, at their request, he told them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6424"></a>In the past, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as the son of a brahmin in Kāsi. On his nameday they called him Teacher Tirīṭavaccha. In due time he grew up, and studied at Taxila. He married and settled down, but his parents&rsquo; death so distressed him <span class="t18">{2.315}</span> that he became an ascetic, and lived in a woodland dwelling, feeding upon the roots and fruits of the forest. <span class="t18">[2.219]</span></p>
<p class="p7">While he lived there, a disturbance arose on the frontiers of Benares. The king repaired there, but was worsted in the fight; fearing for his life, he mounted an elephant, and fled away covertly through the forest. In the morning, Tirīṭavaccha had gone abroad to gather wild fruit, and meanwhile the king came upon his hut. &ldquo;An ascetic&rsquo;s hut!&rdquo; said he; down he came from his elephant, weary with wind and sun, and athirst; he looked about for a waterpot, but none could he find. At the end of the covered walk he spied a well, but he could see no rope and bucket for the drawing of water. His thirst was too great to bear; he took off the girth which passed under the elephant&rsquo;s belly, made it fast on the edge, and let himself down into the well. But it was too short; so he tied on to the end of it his lower garment, and let himself down again. Still he could not reach the water. He could just touch it with his feet: he was very thirsty! &ldquo;If I can but quench my thirst,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;death itself will be sweet!&rdquo; So down he dropped, and drank his fill; but he could not get up again, so he remained standing there in the well. And the elephant, so well trained was he, stood still, waiting for the king.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6425"></a>In the evening, the Bodhisatta returned, laden with wild fruits, and espied the elephant. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;the king is come; but nothing is to be seen save the armed elephant. What&rsquo;s to do?&rdquo; And he approached the elephant, which stood and waited for him. He went to the edge of the well, and saw the king at the bottom. &ldquo;Fear nothing, O king!&rdquo; he called out; then he placed a ladder, and helped the king out; he massaged the king&rsquo;s body, and anointed him with oil; after which he gave him of the fruits to eat, <span class="t18">{2.316}</span> and loosed the elephant&rsquo;s armour. Two or three days the king rested there; then he went away, after making the Bodhisatta promise to pay him a visit.</p>
<p class="p7">The royal forces were encamped nearby the city; and when the king was perceived coming, they flocked around him.</p>
<p class="p7">After a month and half a month, the Bodhisatta returned to Benares, and settled in the park. Next day he came to the palace to ask for food. The king had opened a great window, and stood looking out into the courtyard; and so seeing the Bodhisatta, and recognising him, he descended and gave him greeting; he led him to a dais, and set him upon the throne under a white umbrella; his own food the king gave him to eat, and ate himself of it. Then he took him to the garden, and caused a covered walk and a dwelling to be made for him, and furnished him with all the necessaries of an ascetic; then giving him in charge of a gardener, he bade farewell, and departed. After this, the Bodhisatta took his food in the king&rsquo;s dwelling: great was the respect and honour paid to him.</p>
<p class="p7">But the courtiers could not endure it. &ldquo;If a soldier,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;were to receive such honour, how would he behave!&rdquo; They betook <span class="t18">[2.220] </span>them to the viceroy, &ldquo;My lord, our king is making too much of an ascetic! What can he have seen in the man? You speak with the king about it.&rdquo; The viceroy consented, and they all went together before the king. And the viceroy greeted the king, and uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6426"></a><a id="a6427"></a><a id="a6428"></a><span class="t12">1. Na-y-imassa vijjāmayam-atthi kiñci,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6429"></a><span class="t12">Na bandhavo no pana te sahāyo,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6430"></a><span class="t12">Atha kena vaṇṇena Tirīṭavaccho,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6431"></a><a id="a6432"></a><span class="t12">Tedaṇḍiko bhuñjati aggapiṇḍan-ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6433"></a><a id="a6434"></a><a id="a6435"></a><a id="a6436"></a><a id="a6437"></a><a id="a6438"></a><a id="a6439"></a><a id="a6440"></a><a id="a6441"></a><a id="a6442"></a><span class="t4">There is nothing done with wisdom in him, he is not your kin or companion, for what reason does Tirīṭavaccha, the one with three sticks, eat the choicest food?</span><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t47">{2.317}</span></p>
<p class="p23">The king listened. Then he said, addressing his son,</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;My son, you remember how once I went to the marches, and how I was conquered in war, and came not back for a few days?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said be.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;This man saved my life,&rdquo; said the king; and he told him all that had happened. &ldquo;Well, my son, now that this my preserver is with me, I cannot requite him for what he has done, not even were I to give him my kingdom.&rdquo; And he recited the two verses following:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6443"></a><a id="a6444"></a><a id="a6445"></a><a id="a6446"></a><a id="a6447"></a><span class="t12">2. Āpāsu me yuddhaparājitassa,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><a id="a6456"></a><a id="a6457"></a><a id="a6458"></a><span class="t12">Tenūdatāriṁ dukhasampareto.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6459"></a><a id="a6460"></a><a id="a6461"></a><span class="t4">In distress, being defeated in war, being alone in an awful desert, he stretched out his hand when I was troubled, by that I escaped torment and suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6462"></a><a id="a6463"></a><span class="t12">3. Etassa kiccena idhānupatto,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6464"></a><span class="t12">Vesāyino visayā jīvaloke,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6465"></a><span class="t12">Lābhāraho tāta Tirīṭavaccho,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6466"></a><a id="a6467"></a><a id="a6468"></a><span class="t12">Dethassa bhogaṁ, yajathañ-ca yaññan-ti.</span></p>

<p class="p23">So spake the king, as though he were causing the moon to rise up in the sky; and as the virtue of the Bodhisatta was declared, so was declared his own virtue everywhere; and his takings increased, and the honour shown to him. After that neither his viceroy nor his courtiers nor any one else did say anything against him to the king. The king lived in the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s admonition; and he gave alms and did good, and at the last went to swell the hosts of heaven. And the Bodhisatta, having cultivated the Super Knowledges and Attainments, became destined to the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the Teacher added, &ldquo;Wise men of old gave help too,&rdquo; and having thus concluded his discourse, he identified the Jātaka as follows, &ldquo;Ānanda was the king, and I was the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h3 class="h30"><a id="ncx9423"></a><a id="a6475"></a><a id="a6476"></a><a id="a6477"></a><a id="a6478"></a><a id="a6479"></a><a id="a6480"></a>Ja 260 Dūtajātaka<br/>The Story about (Belly&rsquo;s) Messenger (3s)</h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is very greedy in all his doings, troubling the supporters with his excessive needs. The Buddha tells a story of man who, in order to eat at the king&rsquo;s table, told him he had a message for him. Having eaten his fill he spoke on how greed is driven by the belly&rsquo;s need, thereby pleasing the king.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a6481"></a><a id="a6482"></a><a id="a6483"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = king Bhojanasuddhika (Bhojanasuddhikarājā),</span></p>

<p class="p16"><a id="a6484"></a><span class="t15">Present Source: </span><span class="t15">Ja 434 Cakkavāka</span><span class="t15">,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Quoted at: Ja 42 Kapota, Ja 260 Dūta, Ja 395 Kāka.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a6485"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Greed, Gluttony.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;O king, the belly&rsquo;s messenger.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[2.221]</span><a id="a6486"></a><a id="a6487"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while staying at Jetavana, about a monk who was addicted to covetousness. The circumstances will be given at large under the Kākajātaka [Ja 434],</span><a id="a6488"></a><a href="notes.html#a15301"><span class="t9">{508}</span></a><span class="t30"> in Book the Ninth.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">He was, it was said, greedy after the Buddhist requisites and casting off all duties of master and pastor, entered Sāvatthi quite early, and after drinking excellent rice-gruel served with many a kind of solid food in the house of Visākhā, and after eating in the daytime various dainties, paddy, meat and boiled rice, not satisfied with this he went about thence</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t34">to the house of Culla Anāthapiṇḍika, and the king of Kosala, and various others.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So one day a discussion was raised in the Dhamma Hall concerning his greediness. When the Teacher heard what they were discussing, he sent for that monk and asked him if it were true that he was greedy, and he said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Here again the Teacher told the monk, </span><span class="t18">{2.319}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;You were greedy before, monk, as you are now; and in olden days for your greed you had your head cleft with a sword.&rdquo;</span><a id="a6489"></a><a href="notes.html#a15303"><span class="t9">{509}</span></a><span class="t30"> Then he told a story about the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6490"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king over Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as his son. He grew up, and finished his education at Taxila. On his father&rsquo;s death, he inherited the kingdom, and he was very dainty in his eating; accordingly he earned the name of king Bhojanasuddhika [Pure Food]. There was so much extravagance about his eating, that on one dish he spent a hundred thousand pieces. When he ate, he ate not within doors; but as he wished to confer merit<a id="a6491"></a><a href="notes.html#a15305"><span class="t9">{510}</span></a> upon many people by showing them the costly array of his meals, he caused a pavilion adorned with jewels to be set up at the door, and at the time of eating, he had this decorated, and there he sat upon a royal dais made all of gold, under a white parasol with princesses all around him, and ate the food of a hundred delicate flavours from a dish which cost a hundred thousand pieces of money.</p>
<p class="p7">Now a certain greedy man saw the king&rsquo;s manner of eating, and desired to have a taste. Unable to master his craving, he girt up his loins tight, and ran up to the king, calling out loudly, &ldquo;Messenger! Messenger! O king&rdquo; with his hands held up. (At that time and in that nation, if a man called out &ldquo;Messenger!&rdquo; no one would stay him; and so it was that the multitude divided and gave way for him to pass.)</p>
<p class="p7">The man ran up swiftly, and catching a piece of rice from the king&rsquo;s dish, he put it in his mouth. The swordsman drew his sword, to cleave the man&rsquo;s head. But the king stayed him. &ldquo;Smite not,&rdquo; said he; then to the man, &ldquo;fear nothing, eat on!&rdquo; He washed his hands, and sat down.<span class="t18"> [2.222]</span> <span class="t18">{2.320}</span></p>
<p class="p7">After the meal, the king caused his own drinking water and betel nut to be given to the man, and then said: &ldquo;Now my man, you had tidings, you said. What are your tidings?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6492"></a>&ldquo;O king, I am a messenger from craving and the belly. Says craving to me, Go! And sent me here as her messenger,&rdquo; and with these words he spake the first two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6493"></a><span class="t12">1. Yassatthā dūram-āyanti, amittam-api yācituṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6494"></a><a id="a6495"></a><span class="t12">Tassūdarassahaṁ dūto, mā me kujjha rathesabha.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6496"></a><a id="a6497"></a><a id="a6498"></a><a id="a6499"></a><span class="t4">For his benefit they go far, even to beg an enemy, I am the envoy to his belly, don&rsquo;t be angry, lord of cars.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6500"></a><a id="a6501"></a><a id="a6502"></a><span class="t12">2. Yassa divā ca ratto ca vasam-āyanti māṇavā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tassūdarassahaṁ dūto, mā me kujjha rathesabhā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">By day and by night they come under his belly&rsquo;s control, young man, I am the envoy to his belly, don&rsquo;t be angry, lord of cars.</span></p>
<p class="p23">When this the king heard, he said: &ldquo;That is true; belly-messengers are these; urged by craving they go to and fro, and craving makes them go. How prettily this man has put it!&rdquo; he was pleased with him, and uttered the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6503"></a><a id="a6504"></a><span class="t12">3. Dadāmi te brāhmaṇa rohiṇīnaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6505"></a><a id="a6506"></a><span class="t12">Gavaṁ sahassaṁ saha puṅgavena,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dūto hi dūtassa kathaṁ na dajjaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6507"></a><span class="t12">Mayam-pi tasseva bhavāma dūtā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6508"></a><a id="a6509"></a><a id="a6510"></a><span class="t4">O brahmin, to you I give these red cows, a thousand cows together with their bull, what will an envoy not give an envoy, for we are surely an envoy to him.</span></p>
<p class="p23">So said the king; and continued, &ldquo;I have heard something I never heard before, or thought of, said by this great man.&rdquo; And so pleased was he, that he showered honours upon him. <span class="t18">{2.321}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the greedy monk reached the Fruit of the Third Path, and many others entered the other Paths. &ldquo;The greedy man is the same in both stories, and I was king Bhojanasuddhika.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present Ven. Ānanda helps some monks get lotus flowers to worship the Bodhi tree at Sāvatthi.

The circumstances will be given in the Kāliṅgabodhijātaka [Ja 479].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana about worship of the Bodhi tree performed by elder Ānanda.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6522"></a><span class="t34">When the Tathāgata had set forth on pilgrimage, for the purpose of gathering in those who were ripe for conversion, the citizens of Sāvatthi proceeded to Jetavana, their hands full of garlands and fragrant wreaths, and finding no other place to show their reverence, laid them by the gateway of the perfumed chamber and went off. This caused great rejoicings. But Anāthapiṇḍika got to hear of it; and on the return of the Tathāgata visited elder Ānanda and said to him, &ldquo;This monastery, sir, is left unprovided while the Tathāgata goes on pilgrimage, and there is no place for the people to do reverence by offering fragrant wreaths and garlands. Will you be so kind, sir, as to tell the Tathāgata of this matter, and learn from him whether or not it is possible to find a place for this purpose.&rdquo; The other, quite willingly, did so, asking, &ldquo;How many shrines are there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Three, Ānanda.&rdquo; &ldquo;Which are they?&rdquo; &ldquo;Shrines for a relic of the body, a relic of use or wear, a relic of memorial&rdquo; &ldquo;Can a shrine be made, sir, during your life?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Ānanda, not a body-shrine; that kind is made when a Buddha enters Nibbāna. A shrine of memorial is improper because the connection depends on the imagination only. But the great Bodhi tree used by the Buddhas is fit for a shrine, be they alive or be they dead.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, while you are away on pilgrimage the great monastery of Jetavana</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t34">is unprotected, and the people have no place where they can show their reverence. Shall I plant a seed of the great Bodhi tree before the gateway of Jetavana?&rdquo; &ldquo;By all means so do, Ānanda, and that shall be as it were an abiding place for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The elder told this to Anāthapiṇḍika, and Visākhā, and the king. Then at the gateway of Jetavana he cleared out a pit for the Bodhi tree to stand in, and said to the chief elder, Moggallāna, &ldquo;I want to plant a Bodhi tree in front of Jetavana. Will you get me a fruit of the great Bodhi tree?&rdquo; The elder, willingly, passed through the air to the platform under the Bodhi tree. He placed in his robe a fruit that was dropping from its stalk but had not reached the ground, brought it back, and delivered it to Ānanda. The elder informed the king of Kosala that he was to plant the Bodhi tree that day. So in the evening time the king came with a great concourse, bringing all things necessary; then also Anāthapiṇḍika and Visākhā came and a crowd of the faithful besides.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6523"></a><span class="t34">In the place where the Bodhi tree was to be planted the elder had placed a golden jar, and in the bottom of it was a hole; all was filled with earth moistened with fragrant water. He said: &ldquo;O king, plant this seed of the Bodhi tree,&rdquo; giving it to the king. But the king, thinking that his kingdom was not to be in his hands for ever, and that Anāthapiṇḍika ought to plant it, passed the seed to Anāthapiṇḍika, the great merchant. Then Anāthapiṇḍika stirred up the fragrant soil and dropped it in. The instant it dropped from his hand, before the very eyes of all, it sprang up as broad as a plough-head a Bodhi sapling, fifty cubits tall; on the four sides and upwards shot forth five great branches of fifty cubits in length, like the trunk. So stood the tree, a very lord of the forest already; a mighty miracle! The king poured round the tree jars of gold and of silver, in number eight hundred, filled with scented water, beauteous with a great quantity of blue water-lilies, and caused to be set there a long line of vessels all full, and a seat he had made of the seven precious things, golden dust he had sprinkled about it, a wall was built round the precincts, he erected a gate chamber of the seven precious things. Great was the honour paid to it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The elder, approaching the Tathāgata, said to him, &ldquo;Sir, for the people&rsquo;s good, accomplish under the Bodhi tree which I have planted that height of Attainment to which you attained under the great Bodhi tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is this you say, Ānanda?&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;There is no other place can support me, if I sit there and attain to that which I attained in the enclosure of the great Bodhi tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Ānanda, &ldquo;I pray you for the good of the people, to use this tree for the rapture of Attainment, in so far as this spot of ground can support the weight.&rdquo; The Teacher used it during one night for the rapture of Attainment.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6524"></a><span class="t34">The elder informed the king, and all the rest, and called it by the name of the Bodhi Festival.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This tree was called </span><span class="t18">[2.223]</span><span class="t30"> Ānanda&rsquo;s tree, because Ānanda planted it.</span><a id="a6525"></a><a href="notes.html#a15307"><span class="t9">{511}</span></a><span class="t30"> All Jambudīpa heard tell how the elder had planted this tree by the gate of Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Some monks who lived in the country thought they would make offerings before Ānanda&rsquo;s tree. They journeyed to Jetavana, did their devotions to the Teacher, and next day wended their way to Sāvatthi, to the Lotus Street; but not a garland could they get. So they told Ānanda, how they had wished to make an offering to the tree, but that not a garland was to be had in all the Lotus Street. The elder promised to fetch some; so he went off to the Lotus Street, and returned with many handfuls of blue lotus, which he gave them. With these they made their offering to the tree.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the monks got wind of this, they began discussing the elder&rsquo;s merits in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Friend, some brothers of little merit from the country could not get a single nosegay in the Lotus Bazaar; but the elder went and fetched them some.&rdquo; The Teacher entered, and asked what they were talking of as they sat there; and they told him. Said he, </span><span class="t18">{2.322}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time that a clever tongue has gained a garland for clever speaking; it was the same before.&rdquo;</span><a id="a6526"></a><a href="notes.html#a15310"><span class="t9">{512}</span></a><span class="t30"> And he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a rich merchant&rsquo;s son. In the town was a tank, in which the lotus flowered. A man who had lost his nose looked after the tank.</p>
<p class="p7">It happened one day that they proclaimed holiday in Benares; and the three sons of this rich man thought that they would put wreaths upon them, and go a merrymaking. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll flatter up the old lacknose fellow, and then we&rsquo;ll beg some flowers of him.&rdquo; So at the time when he used to pluck the lotus flowers, to the tank they went, and waited. And one of them uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6527"></a><a id="a6528"></a><a id="a6529"></a><a id="a6530"></a><a id="a6531"></a><span class="t12">1. Yathā kesā ca massū ca, chinnaṁ chinnaṁ virūhati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6532"></a><a id="a6533"></a><span class="t12">Evaṁ ruhatu te nāsā, padumaṁ dehi yācito ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6534"></a><a id="a6535"></a><span class="t4">Just like head hair and beard which are cut off, grow back, so will your nose grow, when begged, give us a lotus.</span></p>
<p class="p23">But the man was angry, and gave none. Then the second said the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Yathā sāradikaṁ bījaṁ khette vuttaṁ virūhati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Evaṁ ruhatu te nāsā, padumaṁ dehi yācito ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6536"></a><span class="t4">Just as in the autumn seeds sewn in the field grow, so will your nose grow, when begged give us a lotus.</span><span class="t4">Again the man was angry, and gave no lotus. Then the third of them repeated the third verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6537"></a><a id="a6538"></a><a id="a6539"></a><a id="a6540"></a><span class="t12">3. Ubho pi palapantete, api padmāni dassati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6541"></a><span class="t12">Vajjuṁ vā te na vā vajjuṁ, natthi nāsāya rūhanā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dehi samma padumāni, ahaṁ yācāmi yācito ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6542"></a><a id="a6543"></a><a id="a6544"></a><span class="t4">Both of these talk nonsense, though he give lotuses, whether they say or don&rsquo;t say, there is no nose grown, friend, give me lotuses, I am begging this ask.</span><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t47">[2.224] {2.323}</span></p>
<p class="p23">On hearing this the lake keeper said: &ldquo;The other two lied, but you have spoken the truth. You deserve to have some lotuses.&rdquo; So he gave him a great bunch of lotus, and went back to his lake.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The boy who got the lotus was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is discontent owing to his love of women. The Buddha tells a story of one princess who successfully managed to elope with her lover, even though the king held her by the hand while she bathed.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;A soft hand.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a discontented monk. They brought him to the Dhamma Hall, and the Teacher asked him if he were really discontent? He replied, &ldquo;Yes, he was.&rdquo; Then said the Teacher, &ldquo;O monks! It is impossible to keep women from going after their desires. In olden days, even wise men could not guard their own daughters; while they stood holding their fathers&rsquo; hand, without their fathers&rsquo; knowing, because of defilements she ran away with a man,&rdquo; and he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, while king Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as the son of his queen consort. Growing up, he was educated at Taxila, and on his father&rsquo;s death he became king in his stead, and reigned righteously.</p>
<p class="p7">There dwelt with him a daughter and a nephew, both together in his house. One day as he sat with his court, he said: &ldquo;When I am dead my nephew will be king, <span class="t18">{2.324}</span> and my daughter will be his chief queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Afterwards, when they were grown up, he was sitting again amidst his court; and he said to them, &ldquo;I will bring home some other man&rsquo;s daughter for my nephew, and my own daughter will I marry into another king&rsquo;s family. In this way I shall have many relations.&rdquo; The courtiers agreed. Then the king assigned to the nephew a house outside the palace, and forbade his coming to the palace. <span class="t18">[2.225]</span></p>
<p class="p7">But these two were in love with each other. Thought the youth, &ldquo;How shall I get the king&rsquo;s daughter outside the house? Ah, I have it.&rdquo; He gave a present to the nurse.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What am I to do for this, master?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Well, mother, I want to get a chance of bringing the princess out of doors.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will talk it over with the princess,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and then tell you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good, mother,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6553"></a>To the princess she came. &ldquo;Let me pick the bugs off of your head,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p class="p7">She sat the princess upon a low stool, and herself sitting on a higher one, she put the princess&rsquo;s head upon her lap, and in looking for the bugs, she scratched the princess&rsquo;s head. The princess understood. She thought: &ldquo;She has scratched me with my cousin the prince&rsquo;s nail, not her own. Mother,&rdquo; asked she, &ldquo;have you been with the prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Yes, my daughter.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo; &ldquo;He asked how he could find a way of getting you out of doors.&rdquo; &ldquo;If he is wise, he will know,&rdquo; said the princess; and she recited the first verse, bidding the old woman learn it and repeat it to the prince:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6554"></a><span class="t12">1. Pāṇi ce muduko cassa, nāgo cassa sukārito,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6555"></a><a id="a6556"></a><a id="a6557"></a><span class="t12">Andhakāro ca vasseyya, atha nūna tadā siyā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6558"></a><span class="t4">If his hand is soft, and his elephant well-trained, should it rain in darkness, then surely it will be.</span></p>
<p class="p23">The woman learned it, and returned to the prince.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, mother, what did the princess say?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Nothing, <span class="t18">{2.325}</span> but only sent you this verse,&rdquo; replied she; and she repeated it. The prince took it in, and dismissed her.</p>
<p class="p7">The prince understood exactly what was meant. He found a beautiful and soft-handed page lad, and prepared him. He bribed the keeper of a state elephant, and having trained the elephant to be impassive, he bided his time. Then, one Uposatha of the dark fortnight, just after the middle watch, rain fell from a thick black cloud. &ldquo;This is the day the princess meant,&rdquo; thought he; he mounted the elephant, and placed the lad of the soft hands on its back, and set out. Opposite the palace he fastened the elephant to the great wall of an open courtyard, and stood before a window getting drenched.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the king watched his daughter, and let her rest nowhere but upon a little bed, in his presence. She thought to herself, &ldquo;Today the prince will come!&rdquo; and lay down without going to sleep. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I want to bathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Come along, my daughter,&rdquo; said the king. Holding her hands, he led her to the window; he lifted her, and placed her on a lotus ornament outside it, holding her by one hand. As she bathed herself, she held out a <span class="t18">[2.226] </span>hand to the prince. He loosed off the bangles from her arm, and fastened them on the arm of his page boy; then he lifted the lad, and placed him upon the lotus beside the princess. <span class="t18">{2.326}</span> She took his hand, and placed it in her father&rsquo;s, who took it, and let go his daughter&rsquo;s hand. Then she loosed the ornaments from her other arm, and fastened them on the other hand of the lad, which she placed in her father&rsquo;s, and went away with the prince. The king thought the lad to be his own daughter; and when the bathing was over, he put him to sleep in the royal bedchamber, shut the door, and set his seal on it; then setting a guard, he retired to his own chamber, and lay down to rest.</p>
<p class="p7">When the daylight came, he opened the door, and there he saw this lad. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried he. The lad told how she was fled along with the prince. The king was cast down. &ldquo;Not even if one goes along and holds hands,&rdquo; thought the king, &ldquo;can one guard a woman. Thus women are impossible to guard,&rdquo; and he uttered these other two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6559"></a><span class="t12">2. Analā mudusambhāsā, duppūrā tā nadīsamā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6560"></a><a id="a6561"></a><a id="a6562"></a><a id="a6563"></a><a id="a6564"></a><span class="t12">Sīdanti naṁ viditvāna, ārakā parivajjaye.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6565"></a><a id="a6566"></a><a id="a6567"></a><a id="a6568"></a><span class="t4">Soft talk is not enough, like rivers hard to fill, knowing this they sink, he should avoid from afar.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6569"></a><a id="a6570"></a><a id="a6571"></a><span class="t12">3. Yaṁ etā upasevanti, chandasā vā dhanena vā,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a6576"></a><a id="a6577"></a><span class="t4">Those who keep company, through desire or through wealth, like a fire in that place, they quickly burn him up. </span><span class="t47">{2.327}</span></p>
<p class="p23">So saying, the Great Being added, &ldquo;I must support my nephew,&rdquo; so with great honour he gave his daughter to this very man, and made him viceroy. And the nephew at his uncle&rsquo;s death became king himself.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths, the discontented monk was firmly established in the Fruit of the First Path, &ldquo;In those days, I was the king.&rdquo;</span></p>

The Teacher had him brought into the Dhamma Hall, and asked if it were true that he was discontent. Yes, said he, it was. &ldquo;Women,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;in olden days made even believing souls do wrong.&rdquo; Then he told a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6588"></a>In the past Brahmadatta, the king of Benares, was childless. He said to his queen, &ldquo;Let us offer prayer for a son.&rdquo; They offered prayer. After a long time, the Bodhisatta came down from the Brahmā Realm, and was conceived by his queen. So soon as he was born, he was bathed, and given to a serving woman to nurse. As he took the breast, he cried. He was given to another; but while a woman held him, he would not be quiet. So he was given to a man servant; and as soon as the man took him, he was quiet. After that men used to carry him about. When they suckled him, they would milk the breast for him, or they gave him the breast from behind a screen. Even when he grew older, they could not show him a woman. The king caused to be made for him a separate place for sitting and so on, and a separate room for meditation, all by himself.</p>
<p class="p7">When the lad was sixteen years old, the king thought thus within himself. &ldquo;Other son have I none, and this one enjoys no pleasures. He will not even wish for the kingdom. What&rsquo;s the good of such a son?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And there was a certain dancing girl, clever at dance and song and music, young, able to gain ascendancy over any man she came across. She approached the king, and asked what he was thinking about; the king told her what it was. <span class="t18">{2.329}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Let be, my lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will allure him, I will make him love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, if you can allure my son, who has never had any dealings whatsoever with women, he shall be king, and you shall be his chief queen!&rdquo; &ldquo;Leave that to me, my lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t be anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So she came to the people of the guard, and said: &ldquo;At dawn of day I will go to the sleeping place of the prince, and outside the room where he meditates apart I will sing. If he is angry, you must tell me, and I will go away; but if he listens, speak my praises.&rdquo; This they agreed to do. <span class="t18">[2.228]</span></p>
<p class="p7">So in the morning time she took her stand in that place, and sang with a voice of honey, so that the music was as sweet as the song, and the song as sweet as the music. The prince lay listening. Next day, he commanded that she should stand near and sing. The next day, he commanded her to stand in the private chamber, and the next, in his own presence; and so by and by desire arose in him; he went the way of the world, and knew the joy of love. &ldquo;I will not let another have this woman,&rdquo; he resolved; and taking his sword, he ran amuck through the street, chasing the people. The king had him captured, and banished him from the city along with the girl.</p>
<p class="p7">Together they journeyed to the jungle, away down the Ganges. There, with the river on one side and the sea on the other, they made a hut, and there they lived. She sat indoors, and cooked the roots and bulbs; the Bodhisatta brought wild fruits from the forest.</p>
<p class="p7">One day, when he was away in search of fruits, an ascetic from an island in the sea, who was going his rounds to get food, saw smoke as he passed through the air, and alighted beside this hut.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6589"></a>&ldquo;Sit down until it is cooked,&rdquo; said the woman; then her woman&rsquo;s charms seduced his soul, and brought it down from his Absorption, making a breach in his purity. And he, like a crow with broken wing, <span class="t18">{2.330}</span> unable to leave her, sat there the whole day till he saw the Bodhisatta coming, and then ran off quickly in the direction of the sea. &ldquo;This must be an enemy,&rdquo; he thought, and drawing his sword set off in chase.</p>
<p class="p7">But the ascetic, making as though he would rise in the air, fell down into the sea. Then thought the Bodhisatta,</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;That man is doubtless an ascetic who came here through the air; and now that his Absorption is broken, he has fallen into the sea. I must go help him.&rdquo; And standing on the shore he uttered these verses:</p>

<p class="p23">When the ascetic heard these words which the Bodhisatta spake, he stood up in the midst of the sea, and resuming his interrupted trance, he rose through the air, and went away to his dwelling place. Thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;That ascetic, with so great a burden, goes through the air like a fleck of cotton. <span class="t18">{2.331}</span> Why should not I, like him, cultivate Absorption, and pass through the air!&rdquo; So he returned to his hut, and led the woman among mankind again; then he told her to be gone, and himself went into the jungle, where he built him a hut in a pleasant spot, and became an ascetic; by focusing on the Meditation Object, he cultivated the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and became destined for the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher declared the Truths; now at the conclusion of the Truths the discontented monk became established in the Fruit of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I was myself the youth that had never had anything to do with women.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the Buddha goes to teach in one village where there was a young and very rich gentleman, who, when he heard the Buddha teach became a monk. When one day they were crossing a river the Buddha asked him to show the palace he had lived in in a previous life, which had sunk under the waters. He did so, and the Buddha then told the story of his previous fame and fortune.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a6618"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (the King of the Devas) Sakka,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a6619"></a><a id="a6620"></a><span class="t15">Bhaddaji = (king) (of Mithilā) Mahāpanāda.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a6621"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Repute, Glory, Devas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo; &rsquo;Twas king Panāda.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told when he was settled on the bank of the Ganges, about the miraculous power of elder Bhaddaji.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On one occasion, when the Teacher had passed the rains at Sāvatthi, he thought he would show kindness to a young gentleman named Bhaddaji. So with all the monks who were with him, he made his way to the city of Bhaddiya, and stayed three months in Jātiyā Grove, waiting until the young man should mature and perfect his knowledge. Now young Bhaddaji was a magnificent person, the only son of a rich merchant in Bhaddiya, with a fortune of eight hundred millions. He had three houses for the three seasons, in each of which he stayed four months; and after spending this period in one of them, he used to migrate with all his kith and kin to another in the greatest pomp. On these occasions all the town was eager to see the young man&rsquo;s magnificence; and between these houses used to be erected seats in circles on circles and tiers above tiers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had been there three months, he informed the townspeople that he intended to leave. Begging him to wait until the morrow, the townsfolk on the following day collected magnificent gifts for the Buddha and his attendant monks; and set up a pavilion in the midst of the town, decorating it and laying out seats; then they announced that the hour had come. The Teacher </span><span class="t18">[2.230] </span><span class="t30">with his company went and took their seats there. Everybody gave generously to them. After the meal was over, the Teacher in a voice sweet as honey returned thanks to them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At this moment, young Bhaddaji was passing from one of his residences to another. </span><a id="a6622"></a><span class="t18">{2.332}</span><span class="t30"> But that day not a soul came to see his splendour; only his own people were about him. So he asked his people how it was. Usually all the city was eager to see him pass from house to house; circles on circles and tiers above tiers the seats were built; but just then there was nobody but his own followers! What could be the reason?</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The reply was, &ldquo;My lord, the Supreme Buddha has been spending three months near the town, and this day he leaves. He has just finished his meal, and is holding a discourse. All the town is there listening to his words.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6623"></a><span class="t30">&ldquo;Oh, very well, we will go and hear him too,&rdquo; said the young man. So, in a blaze of ornaments, with his crowd of followers about him, he went and stood on the skirt of the crowd; as he heard the discourse, he threw off all his defilements, and attained to supreme fruition and became an Arahat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, addressing the merchant of Bhaddiya, said: &ldquo;Sir, your son, in all his splendour, while hearing my discourse has become an Arahat; this very day he should either embrace the ascetic life, or enter Nibbāna.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;I do not wish my son to enter Nibbāna. Admit him to the monastic order; this done, come with him to my house tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Fortunate One accepted this invitation; he took the young gentleman to the monastery, admitted him to the Saṅgha, and afterward to the lower and higher ordinations. For a week the youth&rsquo;s parents showed generous hospitality to him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After remaining these seven days, the Teacher went on alms pilgrimage, taking the young man with him, and arrived at a village called Koṭi. The villagers of Koṭi gave generously to the Buddha and his followers. At the end of this meal, the Teacher began to express his thanks. While this was being done, the young gentleman went outside the village, and by a landing-place of the Ganges he sat down under a tree, and plunged in Absorption, thinking that he would rise as soon as the Teacher should come. When the elders of greatest age approached, he did not rise, but he rose as soon as the Teacher came. The unconverted folk were angry because he behaved as though he were a monk of long standing, not rising up even when he saw the eldest monks approach.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The villagers constructed rafts. This done, </span><span class="t18">{2.333}</span><span class="t30"> the Teacher asked where Bhaddaji was. &ldquo;There he is, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come, Bhaddaji, come aboard my raft.&rdquo; The elder rose, and followed him to his raft. When they were in mid-river, the Teacher asked him a question.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Bhaddaji, where is the palace you lived in when Great Panāda was king?&rdquo; &ldquo;Here, under the water,&rdquo; was the reply. The worldly monks said one to the other, &ldquo;Elder Bhaddaji is declaring his knowledge!&rdquo;</span><a id="a6624"></a><a href="notes.html#a15315"><span class="t9">{514}</span></a><span class="t30"> Then the Teacher bade him disperse the doubt of his fellow-students.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6625"></a><span class="t30">In a moment, the elder, with a bow to his Teacher, moving by his Supernormal Powers, took the whole pile of the palace on his finger, and rose in the air bearing the palace with him (it covered a space of twenty-five leagues); then he made a hole in it and showed himself to the present inhabitants of the palace below, and tossed the building above the water first one league, then two, then three. Then those who had been his kinsfolk in this former existence, who had now become fish or turtles, water-snakes or frogs, because they loved the palace so much, and had come to life in the very same place, wriggled out of it when it rose up, and tumbled over and over into the water again. When the Teacher saw this, he said: &ldquo;Bhaddaji, your relations are in trouble.&rdquo; At his Teacher&rsquo;s words the elder let the palace go, and it sank to the place where it had been before.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher passed to the further side of the Ganges. Then they prepared </span><span class="t18">[2.231] </span><span class="t30">him a seat just on the river bank. On the seat prepared for the Buddha, he sat, like the sun fresh risen pouring forth his rays. Then the monks asked him when it was that elder Bhaddaji had lived in that palace. The Teacher answered, &ldquo;In the days of king Great Panāda,&rdquo; and went on to tell them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, a certain Suruci was king of Mithilā, which is a town in the kingdom of Videha. He had a son, named Suruci likewise, and he again had a son, Mahāpanāda. They obtained possession of that mansion. They obtained it by a deed done in a former existence. A father and son made a hut of leaves with canes and branches of the fig tree, as a dwelling for a Paccekabuddha.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6626"></a>The rest of the story will be told in the Surucijātaka [Ja 489], Book XIV. <span class="t18">{2.334}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">When they died, they were born in the heaven of the Thirty-Three, and dwelt in the six heavens of sense one after the other in direct and in reverse succession, enjoying great majesty among the gods. These two after dying in that region were desirous of winning to the upper Deva world. Sakka perceiving that one of them would be the Tathāgata, went to the door of their mansion, and saluting him as he arose and came to meet him, said: &ldquo;Sir, you must go into the world of men.&rdquo; But he said: &ldquo;O king, the world of men is hateful and loathsome: they who dwell there do good and give alms longing for the world of the gods. What shall I do when I get there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, you shall enjoy in perfection all that can be enjoyed in that world; you shall dwell in a palace made with stones of price, five and twenty leagues in height. Do consent.&rdquo; He consented.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">When Sakka had received his promise, in the guise of a sage he descended into the king&rsquo;s park, and showed himself soaring above those women to and fro in the air, while he chanted, &ldquo;To whom shall I give the blessing of a son, who craves the blessing of a son?&rdquo; &ldquo;To me, sir, to me!&rdquo; thousands of hands were uplifted. Then he said: &ldquo;I give sons to the virtuous: what is your virtue, what your life and conversation?&rdquo; They drew down their uplifted hands, saying: &ldquo;If you would reward virtue, go seek Sumedhā.&rdquo; He went his ways through the air, and hovered at the window of her bedchamber. Then they went and told her, saying: &ldquo;See, my lady, a King of the Devas has come down through the air, and stands at your bedchamber window, offering you the boon of a son!&rdquo; With great pomp she proceeded there, and opening the window, said: &ldquo;Is this true, sir, that I hear, how you offer the blessing of a son to a virtuous woman?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is, and so I do.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then grant it to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is your virtue, tell me; and if you please me, I grant you the boon.&rdquo; Then declaring her virtue she recited these fifteen verses.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">&ldquo;I am king Ruci&rsquo;s consort-queen, the first he ever wed;</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Indeed not a hundred verses, nor a thousand, could suffice to sing the praise of her virtues: yet Sakka allowed her to sing her own praises in these fifteen verses, nor did he cut the tale short though he had much to do elsewhere; then he said: &ldquo;Abundant and marvellous are your virtues,&rdquo; then in her praise he recited a couple of verses:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">&ldquo;All these great virtues, glorious dame, O daughter of a king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Are found in you, which of thyself, O lady, you do sing.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Videha&rsquo;s righteous emperor, your son, shall soon arise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">When these words she heard, in great joy she recited two verses, putting a question to him:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">&ldquo;Unkempt, with dust and dirt begrimed, high-poiséd in the sky,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">You speakest in a lovely voice that pricks me to the heart.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Are you a mighty god, O sage and dwell in heaven on high?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">O tell me whence you comest here, O tell me who you are!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">He told her in six verses:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">&ldquo;Sakka the hundred-eyed you see, for so the gods me call</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">When they are wont to assemble in the heavenly judgement hall.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t25">When women virtuous, wise, and good here in the world are found,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">True wives, to husband&rsquo;s mother kind even as in duty bound,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">When such a woman wise of heart and good in deed they know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">To her, though woman, they divine, the gods themselves will go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">So lady, you, through worthy life, through store of good deeds done,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">A princess born, all happiness the heart can wish, have won.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">So you do reap your deeds, princess, by glory on the earth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">And after in the world of gods a new and heavenly birth.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">O wise, O blessed! So live on, preserve your conduct right:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Now I to heaven must return, delighted with your sight.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">&ldquo;I have business to do in the world of gods,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;therefore I go; but do you be vigilant.&rdquo; With this advice he departed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the morning time, the Devaputta Naḷakāra was conceived within her womb. When she discovered it, she told the king, and he did what was necessary for a woman with child. At the end of ten months she brought forth a son, and they gave him Mahāpanāda for his name. All the people of the two countries came crying out, &ldquo;My lord, we bring this for the boy&rsquo;s milk-money,&rdquo; and each dropped a coin in the king&rsquo;s courtyard: a great heap there was of them. The king did not wish to accept this, but they would not take the money back, but said as they departed, &ldquo;When the boy grows up, my lord, it will pay for his keep.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6628"></a><span class="t11">The lad was brought up amid great magnificence; and when he came of years, aye, no more than sixteen, he was perfect in all accomplishments. The king thinking of his son&rsquo;s age, said to the queen, &ldquo;My lady, when the time comes for the ceremonial sprinkling of our son, let us make him a fine palace for that occasion.&rdquo; She was quite willing. The king sent for those who had skill in divining the auspicious place for a building, and said to them, &ldquo;My friends, get a master-mason, and build me a palace not far from my own. This is for my son, whom we are about to consecrate as my successor.&rdquo; They said it was well, and proceeded to examine the surface of the ground. At that moment Sakka&rsquo;s throne became hot. Perceiving this, he at once summoned Vissakamma, and said: &ldquo;Go, my good Vissakamma, make for prince Mahāpanāda a palace half a league in length and breadth and five and twenty leagues in height, all with stones of price.&rdquo; Vissakamma took on the shape of a mason, and approaching the workmen said: &ldquo;Go and eat your breakfast, then return.&rdquo; Having thus got rid of the men, he struck on the earth with his staff; in that instant up rose a palace, seven storeys high, of the aforesaid size.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now for Mahāpanāda these three ceremonies were done together: the ceremony for consecrating the palace, the ceremony for spreading above him the royal umbrella, the ceremony of his marriage. At the time of the ceremony all the people of both countries gathered together, and spent seven years feasting, nor did the king dismiss them: their clothes, their ornaments, their food and their drink and all the rest of it, these things were all provided by the royal family. At the seven years&rsquo; end they began to grumble, and king Suruci asked why. &ldquo;O king,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;while we have been revelling at this feast seven years have gone by. When will the feast come to an end?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;My good friends, all this while my son has never once laughed. So soon as he shall laugh, we will disperse again.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Then the crowd went beating the drum and gathered the tumblers and jugglers together. Thousands of tumblers were gathered, and they divided themselves into seven bands and danced; but they could not make the prince laugh. Of course he that had seen the dancing of dancers divine could not care for such dancers as these. Then came two clever jugglers, Bhaṇḍukaṇṇa and Paṇḍukaṇṇa, Crop-ear and Yellow-ear, and say they, &ldquo;We will make the prince laugh.&rdquo; Bhaṇḍukaṇṇa made a great mango tree, which he called Sanspareil, grow before the palace door: then he threw up a ball of string, and made it catch on a branch of the tree, and then up he climbed into the Mango Sanspareil. Now the Mango Sanspareil they say is Vessavaṇa&rsquo;s mango. And the slaves of Vessavaṇa took him, as usual, chopped him up by the various limbs and threw down the bits. The other jugglers joined the pieces together, and poured water upon them. The man donned upper and under garments of flowers, and rose up and began dancing again. Even the sight of this did not make the prince laugh. Then Paṇḍukaṇṇa had some firewood piled in the courtyard and went into the fire with his troop. When the fire was burnt out, the people sprinkled the pile with water. Paṇḍukaṇṇa with his troop rose up dancing with upper and under garments of flowers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">When the people found they could not make him laugh, they grew angry. Sakka, perceiving this, sent down a divine dancer, bidding him make prince Mahāpanāda laugh. Then he came and remained poised in the air above the royal courtyard, and performed what is called the Half-body dance: one hand, one foot, one eye, one tooth, go dancing, throbbing, flickering to and fro, all the rest stood still. Mahāpanāda, when he saw this, gave a little smile. But the crowd roared and roared with laughter, could not cease laughing, laughed themselves out of their wits, lost control of their limbs, rolled over and over in the royal courtyard, and that was the end of the festival.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;When many a bow.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about a monk who had lost all energy. The Teacher asked, was it true that this monk had lost his energy. Yes, he replied. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;have you slackened your energy, after embracing this dispensation? In days of yore, wise men were energetic even in matters which do not lead to escape,&rdquo; and so saying he told a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">[2.232]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, while Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into the family of a forester. When he grew up, he took the lead of a band of five hundred foresters, and lived in a village at the entrance to the forest. He used to hire himself out to guide men through it.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day a man of Benares, a merchant&rsquo;s son, arrived at that village with a caravan of five hundred wagons. Sending for the Bodhisatta, he offered him a thousand pieces to be his guide through the forest. He agreed, and received the money from the merchant&rsquo;s hand; and as he took it, he mentally devoted his life to the merchant&rsquo;s service. Then he guided him into the forest.</p>
<p class="p7">In the midst of the forest, up rose five hundred robbers. As for the rest of the company, no sooner did they see these robbers, than they grovelled upon their belly: the head forester alone, shouting and leaping and dealing blows, put to flight all the five hundred robbers, and led the merchant across the wood in safety. Once across the forest, the merchant encamped his caravan; <span class="t18">{2.336}</span> he gave the chief forester choice meats of every kind, and himself having broken his fast, sat pleasantly by him, and talked with him thus, &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how it was that even when five hundred robbers, with arms in their hands, were spread all around, you felt not even any fear in your heart?&rdquo; And he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6666"></a><a id="a6667"></a><a id="a6668"></a><a id="a6669"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Disvā khurappe dhanuveganunne,</span></p>

<p class="p23">Thus did he send forth his words like a shower of arrows; and having explained how he had done heroically through being free from the desire to live, he parted from the young merchant, and returned to his own village; where after giving alms and doing good he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>

Playing hard to get she is unreponsive to his advances, and he leaves her never to return, which leads to her pining away.

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At Sāvatthi, we learn, a handsome woman saw this man, who was also handsome, and fell in love. The passion within her was like a fire burning her body through and through. She lost her senses, both of body and of mind; she cared nothing for food; she only lay down hugging the frame of the bedstead.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Her friends and handmaidens asked her what troubled her at heart that she lay hugging the bedstead; what was the matter, they wished to know. The first few times she answered nothing; but as they continued pressing her, she told them what it was.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll bring him to you,&rdquo; and they went and had a talk with the man. At first he refused, but by their much asking he at last consented. They got his promise to come at a certain hour on a fixed day, and told the woman.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">She prepared her chamber, and dressed herself in her finery, and sat on the bed waiting until he came. He sat down beside her. Then a thought came into her mind. </span><span class="t18">{2.338}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;If I accept his advances at once, and make myself cheap, my pride will be humbled. To let him have his will the very first day he comes would be out of place. I will be capricious today, and afterwards I will give way.&rdquo; So no sooner had he touched her, and begun to dally, she caught his hands, and spoke roughly to him, bidding him go away, as she did not want him. He shrank back angrily, and went off home.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the women found out what she had done, and that the man had gone off, they reproached her. &ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;in love with somebody, and lie down refusing to take nourishment; we had great difficulty in persuading the man, but at last we bring him; and then you have nothing to say to him!&rdquo; She told them why it was, and they went off; warning her that she would get talked about.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The man never even came to look at her again. When she found she had lost him, she would take no nourishment, and soon died. When the man heard of her death, he took a quantity of flowers, scents, and perfumes, and went to Jetavana, where he saluted the Teacher and sat on one side.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher asked him, &ldquo;How is it, lay brother, that we never see you here?&rdquo; He told him the whole story, adding that he had avoided waiting on the Buddha all this time for shame. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Layman, on this occasion the woman sent for you through her passion, and then would have nothing to do with you and sent you away angry; and just so in olden days, she fell in love with wise persons, sent for them, and when they came refused to have anything to do with them, and thus plagued them and sent them back again.&rdquo; Then at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6708"></a><a id="a6709"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was a Sindh horse, and they called him Vātagga [Great Wind]; and he was the king&rsquo;s horse of ceremony. The grooms used to take him to bathe in the Ganges. There a certain female ass saw him, and fell in love.<span class="t18"> [2.234]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Trembling with passion, <span class="t18">{2.339}</span> she neither ate grass nor drank water; but pined away and became thin, until she was nothing but skin and bone. Then a foal of hers, seeing her pining away, said: &ldquo;Why do you eat no grass, mother, and drink no water; and why do you pine away, and lie trembling in this place or that? What is the matter?&rdquo; She would not say; but after he had asked again and again, she told him the matter.</p>
<p class="p7">Then her foal comforted her, saying: &ldquo;Mother, do not be troubled; I will bring him to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6710"></a>So when Vātagga went down to bathe, the foal said, approaching him, &ldquo;Sir, my mother is in love with you: she takes no food, and she is pining away to death. Give her life!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Good, my lad, I will,&rdquo; said the horse. &ldquo;When my bath is over, the grooms let me go awhile to exercise on the river bank. Do you bring your mother to that place.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So the foal fetched his mother, and turned her loose in the place; then he hid himself nearby.</p>
<p class="p7">The groom let Vātagga go for a run; he spied the female ass, and came up to her.</p>
<p class="p7">Now when the horse came up and began to sniff at her, thought the ass to herself, &ldquo;If I make myself cheap, and let him have his way as soon as he has come here, my honour and pride will perish. I must make as though I did not wish it.&rdquo; So she gave him a kick on the lower jaw, and scampered away. It broke his jaw, and half killed him. &ldquo;What does she matter to me?&rdquo; thought Vātagga; <span class="t18">{2.340}</span> he felt ashamed and made off.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the ass repented, and lay down on the spot in grief. And her son the foal came up, and asked her a question in the following lines:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6711"></a><a id="a6712"></a><a id="a6713"></a><span class="t12">1. Yenāsi kisiyā paṇḍu yena bhattaṁ na ruccati,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><span class="t4">That by which you grew thin, yellow, and did not take delight in food, that master, he has returned, why at this time do you run away?</span></p>
<p class="p23">Hearing her son&rsquo;s voice, the ass repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6717"></a><a id="a6718"></a><a id="a6719"></a><a id="a6720"></a><a id="a6721"></a><span class="t12">2. Sace panādikeneva santhavo nāma jāyati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6722"></a><a id="a6723"></a><span class="t12">Yaso hāyati itthīnaṁ, tasmā tāta palāyahan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6724"></a><a id="a6725"></a><a id="a6726"></a><span class="t4">If at the beginning itself what&rsquo;s called intimacy arises, for women their fame is lost, therefore, my dear, I do run away.</span></p>
<p class="p23">In these words she explained the feminine nature to her son. <span class="t18">[2.235]</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, after Fully Awakening, repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6727"></a><a id="a6728"></a><a id="a6729"></a><a id="a6730"></a><a id="a6731"></a><span class="t12">3. Yasassinaṁ kule jātaṁ āgataṁ yā na icchati,</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Gold-clawed creature.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {2.341}</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about a certain woman.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">We are told that a certain landowner of Sāvatthi, with his wife, was on a journey into the country for the purpose of collecting debts, when he fell among robbers. Now the wife was very beautiful and charming. The robber chief was so taken by her that he purposed killing the husband to get her. But the woman was good and virtuous, a devoted wife. She fell at the robber&rsquo;s feet, crying, &ldquo;My lord, if you kill my husband for love of me, I will take poison, or stop my breath, and kill myself too! With you I will not go. Do not kill my husband uselessly!&rdquo; In this way she begged him off.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">They both got back safe to Sāvatthi. Then it occurred to them as they passed the monastery in Jetavana, that they would visit it and salute the Teacher. So to the perfumed cell they went, and after salutation sat down on one side. The Teacher asked them where they had been. &ldquo;To collect our debts,&rdquo; they replied. &ldquo;Did your journey pass off without mishap?&rdquo; he asked next. &ldquo;We were captured by robbers on the way,&rdquo; said the husband, &ldquo;and the chief wanted to murder me; but my wife here begged for me, and I owe my life to her.&rdquo; Then said the Teacher, &ldquo;You are not the only one, layman, whose life she has saved. In days of yore she saved the lives of other wise men.&rdquo; And then at his request the Teacher told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, there was a great lake in the Himālayas, wherein was a great golden crab. Because he lived there, the place was known as the crab lake. The crab was very large, as big round as a threshing floor; it would catch elephants, and kill <span class="t18">[2.236] </span>and eat them; and from fear of it <span class="t18">{2.342}</span> the elephants did not go down and browse there.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the Bodhisatta was conceived by the mate of an elephant, the leader of a herd, living nearby this crab lake. The mother, in order to be safe till her delivery, sought another place on a mountain, and there she was delivered of a son; who in due time grew to years of wisdom, and was great and mighty, and prospered, and he was like a purple mountain of collyrium.</p>
<p class="p7">He chose another elephant for his mate, and he resolved to catch this crab. So with his mate and his mother, he sought out the elephant herd, and finding his father, proposed to go and catch the crab.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;You will not be able to do that, my son,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p class="p7">But he begged the father again and again to give him leave, until at last he said: &ldquo;Well, you may try.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So the young elephant collected all the elephants beside the crab lake, and led them close by the lake. &ldquo;Does the crab catch them when they go down, or while they are feeding, or when they come up again?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">They replied, &ldquo;When the beasts come up again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you all go down to the lake and eat whatever you see, and come up first; I will follow last behind you.&rdquo; And so they did.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the crab, seeing the Bodhisatta coming up last, caught his feet tight in his claw, like a smith who seizes a lump of iron in a huge pair of tongs. The Bodhisatta&rsquo;s mate did not leave him, but stood there close by him. The Bodhisatta pulled at the crab, but could not make him budge. Then the crab pulled, and drew him towards himself. At this in deadly fear the elephant roared and roared; hearing which all the other elephants, in deadly terror, ran off trumpeting, and dropping excrement. Even his mate could not stand, but began to make off. <span class="t18">{2.343}</span> Then to tell her how he was held a prisoner, he uttered the first verse, hoping to stay her from her flight:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6744"></a><a id="a6745"></a><a id="a6746"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Siṅgī migo āyatacakkhunetto,</span></p>

<p class="p23">Then his mate turned round, and repeated the second verse to his comfort:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6759"></a><a id="a6760"></a><a id="a6761"></a><a id="a6762"></a><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Ayya na taṁ jahissāmi, kuñjaraṁ saṭṭhihāyanaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a6764"></a><a id="a6765"></a><span class="t4">&ldquo;Dear sir, I will not abandon you, elephant of sixty years, by the four quarters on the earth you are the one most dear to me.&rdquo;</span><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t47">[2.237]</span></p>
<p class="p23">In this way she encouraged him; and saying: &ldquo;Noble sir, now I will talk to the crab a while to make him let you go,&rdquo; she addressed the crab in the third verse: <span class="t18">{2.344}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6766"></a><a id="a6767"></a><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Ye&nbsp; kuḷīrā samuddasmiṁ, Gaṅgāya Yamunāya ca,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6768"></a><span class="t12">Tesaṁ tvaṁ vārijo seṭṭho, muñca rodantiyā patin-ti.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">&ldquo;Those crabs in the ocean, and in the Ganges and the Yamunā, of these you&rsquo;re the best born in water, through my cries free my husband.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p23">As she spoke thus, the crab&rsquo;s fancy was smitten with the sound of the female voice, and forgetting all fear he loosed his claws from the elephant&rsquo;s leg, and suspected nothing of what he would do when he was set free. Then the elephant lifted his foot, and stepped upon the crab&rsquo;s back; and at once his eyes startled out. The elephant shouted the joy-cry. Up ran the other elephants all, pulled the crab along and set him upon the ground, and trampled him to mincemeat. His two claws broken from his body lay apart. And this crab lake, being near the Ganges, when there was a flood in the Ganges, was filled with Ganges water; when the water subsided it ran from the lake into the Ganges. Then these two claws were lifted and floated along the Ganges. One of them reached the sea, the other was found by the ten royal brothers while playing in the water, and they took it and made of it the little drum called Ānaka. The Asuras found that which reached the sea, and made it into the drum called Āḷambara. These afterwards being worsted in battle with Sakka, ran off and left it behind. Then Sakka caused it to be kept for his own use; and it is of this they say, &ldquo;There is thunder like the Āḷambara cloud!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths both husband and wife attained the Fruit of the First Path. </span><span class="t18">{2.345}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;In those days, this lay sister was the female elephant, and I myself was her mate.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Best of all.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling in the country near Dakkhiṇāgiri, about a gardener&rsquo;s son.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the rains, the Teacher left Jetavana, and went on alms pilgrimage in the </span><span class="t18">[2.238] </span><span class="t30">district about Dakkhiṇāgiri. A layman invited the Buddha and his company, and made them sit down in his grounds while he gave them rice and cakes. Then he said: &ldquo;If any of the masters care to see over the grounds, they might go along with the gardener,&rdquo; and he ordered the gardener to supply them with any fruit they might fancy.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">By and by they came upon a bare spot. &ldquo;What is the reason,&rdquo; they asked, &ldquo;that this spot is bare and treeless?&rdquo; &ldquo;The reason is,&rdquo; answered the gardener, &ldquo;that a certain gardener&rsquo;s son, who had to water the saplings, thought he had better give them water in proportion to the length of the roots; so he pulled them all up to see, and watered them accordingly. The result was that the place became bare.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks returned, and told this to their Teacher. Said he, &ldquo;Not only now has the lad destroyed a plantation; he did just the same before,&rdquo; and then he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when a king named Vissasena was reigning over Benares, proclamation was made of a holiday. The park keeper thought he would go and keep holiday; so calling the monkeys that lived in the park, he said:</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;This park is a great blessing to you. I want to take a week&rsquo;s holiday. Will you water the saplings on the seventh day?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said they; he gave them the watering-skins, and went his way.</p>
<p class="p7">The monkeys drew water, and began to water the roots.</p>
<p class="p7">The eldest monkey cried out, &ldquo;Wait, now! It&rsquo;s hard to get water always. We must be careful about it. Let us pull up the plants, <span class="t18">{2.346}</span> and see the length of their roots; if they have long roots, they need plenty of water; but short ones need but a little.&rdquo; &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; they agreed; then some of them pulled up the plants; then others put them in again, and watered them.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta at the time was a young gentleman living in Benares. Something or other took him to this park, and he saw what the monkeys were doing.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Who bids you do that?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;Our chief,&rdquo; they replied.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;If that is the wisdom of the chief, what must the rest of you be like!&rdquo; said he; and to explain the matter, he uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6779"></a><a id="a6780"></a><a id="a6781"></a><a id="a6782"></a><a id="a6783"></a><a id="a6784"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Yo ve sabbasam-etānaṁ ahuvā seṭṭhasammato,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6785"></a><span class="t12">Tassāyaṁ edisī paññā, kim-eva itarā pajā ti?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6786"></a><a id="a6787"></a><a id="a6788"></a><a id="a6789"></a><span class="t4">&ldquo;He who was esteemed as the best of all of them, such is his wisdom, why ask about other folk?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p23">Hearing this remark, the monkeys rejoined with the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6790"></a><a id="a6791"></a><a id="a6792"></a><a id="a6793"></a><a id="a6794"></a><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Evam-eva tuvaṁ Brahme, anaññāya vinindasi,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6795"></a><span class="t12">Kathaṁ mūlaṁ adisvāna, rukkhaṁ jaññā patiṭṭhitan-ti.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6796"></a><a id="a6797"></a><a id="a6798"></a><a id="a6799"></a><span class="t4">&ldquo;Truly such are you, Brahmā, although unknowing, you reproach me, without having seen the root, how can we know which tree is grounded?&rdquo;</span><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t47">[2.239]</span></p>
<p class="p23">To which the Bodhisatta replied by the third, as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6800"></a><a id="a6801"></a><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Nāhaṁ tumhe vinindāmi ye caññe vānarā vane,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6802"></a><a id="a6803"></a><a id="a6804"></a><a id="a6805"></a><a id="a6806"></a><a id="a6807"></a><a id="a6808"></a><a id="a6809"></a><span class="t12">Vissaseno va gārayho, yassatthā rukkharopakā ti.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6810"></a><a id="a6811"></a><a id="a6812"></a><a id="a6813"></a><a id="a6814"></a><span class="t4">&ldquo;I do not reproach you or any other monkeys in the woods, Vissasena is blameworthy, and those whose aim is to grow trees.&rdquo;</span><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t47">{2.347}</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">When this discourse was ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The lad who destroyed the park was the monkey chief, and I was the wise man.&rdquo;</span></p>
