<p class="p7"><span class="t15">There is no story of the present. The Buddha tells a story of how a queen was caught in an affair with her groom, and was removed from her high position.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a10625"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = king (of the cuckoos) Kuṇāla.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Poor fickle creatures.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[4.91]</span><span class="t17"> </span><span class="t18">{4.144}</span><a id="a10629"></a><span class="t30"> This birth will be given under the Kuṇālajātaka [Ja 536].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past the wife of Brahmadatta, Piṅgiyānī by name, opening her window looked out and saw a royal groom, and, when the king had fallen asleep, she got down through the window and committed adultery with him, and then again climbed back to the palace and shampooed her person with perfumes and lay down with the king. Now one day the king thought: &ldquo;I wonder why at midnight the person of the queen is always cool: I will examine into the matter.&rdquo; So one day he pretended to be asleep and got up and followed her and saw her committing folly with a groom. He returned and climbed up to his chamber, and she too after she had been guilty of adultery came and lay down on the small bed. Next day the king, in the presence of his ministers, summoned her and made known her misconduct, saying: &ldquo;All women alike are sinners.&rdquo; And he forgave her offence, though it deserved death, imprisonment, mutilation, or cleaving asunder, but he deposed her from her high rank and made someone else his queen consort. At that time king Kuṇāla was Brahmadatta, and so it was that he told this story as of something he had seen with his own eyes, and by way of illustration he repeated this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10630"></a><span class="t25">1. &ldquo;Fair Piṅgiyānī was as wife adored</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">By Brahmadatta, earth&rsquo;s all conquering lord,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Yet did wrong with devoted husband&rsquo;s slave,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">And lost by lechery both king and cheat.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">After telling of the defilements of women in old world stories, in yet another way, still speaking of their misdeeds, he said:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10631"></a><a id="a10632"></a><a id="a10633"></a><span class="t25">2. &ldquo;Poor fickle creatures women are, ungrateful, treacherous they,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">No man if not possessed would deign to credit aught they say.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">3. Little reck they of duty&rsquo;s call or plea of gratitude,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Insensible to parents&rsquo; love and ties of Saṅgha,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Transgressing every law of right, they play a shameless part,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">In all their acts obedient to the wish of their own heart.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">4. However long they dwell with him, though kind and loving he,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Tender of heart and dear to them as life itself may be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">In times of trouble and distress, leave him they will and must,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">I for my part in womenfolk can never put my trust.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">5. How often is a woman&rsquo;s mind like shifty monkey&rsquo;s found,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Or like the shade cast by a tree on height or depth around,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">How changeful too the purpose lodged within a woman&rsquo;s breast,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Like tire of wheel revolving swift without a pause or rest.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">6. Whene&rsquo;er with due reflection they look round and see their way</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">To captivate some man of wealth and make of him their prey,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Such simpletons with words so soft and smooth they captive lead,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">E&rsquo;en as Cambodian groom with herbs will catch the fiercest steed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">7. But if when looking round with care they fail to see their way</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">To get possession of his wealth and make of him a prey,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">They drive him off, as one that now has reached the furthest shore</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">And cuts adrift the ferry boat he needeth nevermore.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">8. Like fierce devouring flame they hold him fast in their embrace,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Or sweep him off like stream in flood that hurries on apace;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">They court the man they hate as much as one that they adore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">E&rsquo;en as a ship that hugs alike the near and farther shore.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">9. They not to one or two belong, like open stall are they,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">One might as soon catch wind with net as women hold in sway.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">10. Like river, road, or drinking shed, assembly hall or inn,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">So free to all are womenfolk, no limits check their sins.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">11. Fell as black serpent&rsquo;s head are they, as ravenous as a fire,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">As kine the choicest herbage pick, they lovers rich desire.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">12. From elephant, black serpent, and from flame that&rsquo;s fed on ghee,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">From man besprinkled to be king, and women we should flee.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">All these whoso is on his guard will treat as deadly foe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Indeed their very nature it is very hard to know.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">13. Women who very clever are or very fair to view,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">And such as many men admire &ndash; all these one should eschew;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">A neighbour&rsquo;s wife and one that seeks a man of wealth for mate,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Such kind of women, five in all, no man should cultivate.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the Sākiyans deceive the king of Kosala and send him the daughter of a slave girl as his new queen. When the son of this arrangement finds out he determines to destroy the clan. The Buddha tries to save them, but in the end he cannot. He then tells how a Devatā of a large tree succeeded in saving his relations in the past.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Who are you.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10645"></a><a id="a10646"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling in Jetavana about doing good to one&rsquo;s kith and kin. At Sāvatthi in the house of Anāthapiṇḍika there was always unfailing food for five hundred monks, and the same with Visākhā</span><a id="a10647"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15961"><span class="t9">{821}</span></a><span class="t30"> and the king of Kosala. But in the king&rsquo;s palace, various and fine as was the fare given, no one was friendly to the monks. The result was that the monks never ate in the palace, but they took their food and went off to eat it at the house of Anāthapiṇḍika or Visākhā or some other of their trusted friends.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10648"></a><a id="a10649"></a><span class="t30">One day the king said: &ldquo;A present has been brought; take this to the monks,&rdquo; and sent it to the refectory. An answer was brought that no monks were there in the refectory. &ldquo;Where are they gone?&rdquo; he asked. They were sitting in their friends&rsquo; houses to eat, was the reply. So the king after his morning meal came into the Teacher&rsquo;s presence, and asked him, &ldquo;Good sir, what is the best kind of food?&rdquo; &ldquo;The food of friendship is the best, great king,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;even sour rice-gruel given by a friend becomes sweet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, sir, and with whom do the monks find friendship?&rdquo; &ldquo;With their kindred, great king, or with the Sakya families.&rdquo; Then the king thought, what if he were to make a Sakya girl his queen-consort; then the monks would be his friends, as it were with their own kindred. </span><span class="t18">{4.145}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So rising from his seat, he returned to the palace, and sent a message </span><span class="t18">[4.92] </span><a id="a10650"></a><span class="t30">to Kapilavatthu</span><a id="a10651"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15963"><span class="t9">{822}</span></a><a id="a10652"></a><span class="t30"> to this effect, &ldquo;Please give me one of your daughters in marriage, for I wish to become connected with your family.&rdquo; On receipt of this message the Sakyas gathered together and deliberated. &ldquo;We live in a place subject to the authority of the king of Kosala; if we refuse a daughter, he will be very angry, and if we give her, the custom of our clan will be broken. What are we to do?&rdquo; Then Mahānāma</span><a id="a10653"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15965"><span class="t9">{823}</span></a><a id="a10654"></a><span class="t30"> said to them, &ldquo;Do not trouble about it. I have a daughter, named Vāsabhakhattiyā. Her mother is a slave woman, Nāgamuṇḍā by name; she is some sixteen years of age, of great beauty and auspicious prospects, and by her father&rsquo;s side noble.</span><a id="a10655"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15967"><span class="t9">{824}</span></a><span class="t30"> We will send her, as a girl nobly born.&rdquo; The Sakyas agreed, and sent for the messengers, and said they were willing to give a daughter of the clan, and that they might take her with them at once. But the messengers reflected: &ldquo;These Sakyas are desperately proud, in matters of birth. Suppose they should send a girl who was not of them, and say that she was so? We will take none but one who eats along with them.&rdquo; So they replied, &ldquo;Well, we will take her, but we will take one who eats along with you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Sakyas assigned a lodging for the messengers, and then wondered what to do. Mahānāma said: &ldquo;Now do not trouble about it; I will find a way. At my mealtime bring in Vāsabhakhattiyā dressed up in her finery; then just as I have taken one mouthful, produce a letter, and say, &lsquo;My lord, such a king has sent you a letter; be pleased to hear his message at once.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">They agreed; and as he was taking his meal they dressed and adorned the maid. &ldquo;Bring my daughter,&rdquo; said Mahānāma, &ldquo;and let her take food with me.&rdquo; &ldquo;In a moment,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;as soon as she is properly adorned,&rdquo; and after a short delay they brought her in. Expecting to take food with her father, she dipped her hand into the same dish. Mahānāma had taken one mouthful with her, and put it in his mouth; but just as he stretched out his hand for another, they brought him a letter, saying: &ldquo;My lord, such a king has sent a letter to you: be pleased to hear his message at once.&rdquo; Said Mahānāma, &ldquo;Go on with your meal, my dear,&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.146}</span><span class="t30"> and holding his right hand in the dish, with his left took the letter and looked at it. As he examined the message the maiden went on eating. When she had eaten, he washed his hand and rinsed out his mouth. The messengers were firmly convinced that she was his daughter, for they did not divine the secret.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So Mahānāma sent away his daughter in great pomp. The messengers brought her to Sāvatthi, and said that this maiden was the true-born daughter of Mahānāma. The king was pleased, and caused the whole city to be decorated, and placed her upon a pile of treasure, and by a ceremonial sprinkling made her his chief queen. She was dear to the king, and beloved.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10656"></a><span class="t30">In a short time the queen conceived, and the king caused the proper treatment to be used; and at the end of ten months, she brought forth a son whose colour was a golden brown. On the day of his naming, the king sent a message to his grandmother, saying: &ldquo;A son has been born to Vāsabhakhattiyā, daughter of the Sakya king; what shall his name be?&rdquo; Now the courtier who was charged with this message was slightly deaf; but he went and told the king&rsquo;s grandmother. When she heard it, she said: &ldquo;Even when Vāsabhakhattiyā had never borne a son, she was more than all the world; and now she will be the king&rsquo;s darling.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10657"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15969"><span class="t9">{825}</span></a><span class="t30"> The deaf man did not hear the word &ldquo;darling&rdquo; aright, but thought she said: &ldquo;Viḍūḍabha,&rdquo; so back he went to the king, and told him that he was to name the prince Viḍūḍabha. This, the king thought, must be some ancient family name, and so named him Viḍūḍabha. After this the prince grew up and was treated as a prince should be.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When he was at the age of seven years, having observed how the other princes received presents of toy elephants and horses and other toys from the family of their mothers&rsquo; fathers, the lad said to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, the </span><span class="t18">[4.93] </span><span class="t30">rest of them get presents from their mothers&rsquo; family, but no one sends me anything. Are you an orphan?&rdquo; Then she replied, &ldquo;My boy, your grandfathers are the Sakya kings, but they live a long way off, and that is why they send you nothing.&rdquo; Again when he was sixteen, he said: &ldquo;Mother, I want to see your father&rsquo;s family.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it, child,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What will you do when you get there?&rdquo; But though she put him off, he asked her again and again. At last his mother said, </span><span class="t18">{4.147}</span><a id="a10658"></a><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Well, go then.&rdquo; So the lad got his father&rsquo;s consent, and set out with a number of followers. Vāsabhakhattiyā sent on a letter before him to this effect, &ldquo;I am living here happily; let not my masters tell him anything of the secret.&rdquo; But the Sakyas, on hearing of the coming of Viḍūḍabha, sent off all their young children into the country. &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;to receive him with respect.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the prince arrived at Kapilavatthu, the Sakyas had assembled in the royal rest-house. The prince approached the rest house, and waited. Then they said to him, &ldquo;This is your mother&rsquo;s father, this is her brother,&rdquo; pointing them out. He walked from one to the other, saluting them. But although he bowed to them till his back ached, not one of them vouchsafed a greeting; so he asked, &ldquo;Why is it that none of you greet me?&rdquo; The Sakyas replied, &ldquo;My dear, the youngest princes are all in the country,&rdquo; then they entertained him grandly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10659"></a><span class="t30">After a few days stay, he set out for home with all his retinue. Just then a slave woman washed the seat which he had used in the rest house with milk-water, saying insultingly, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the seat where sat the son of Vāsabhakhattiyā, the slave girl!&rdquo; A man who had left his spear behind was just fetching it, when he overheard the abuse of prince Viḍūḍabha. He asked what it meant. He was told that Vāsabhakhattiyā was born of a slave to Mahānāma the Sakya. This he told to the soldiers; a great uproar arose, all shouting, &ldquo;Vāsabhakhattiyā is a slave woman&rsquo;s daughter, so they say!&rdquo; The prince heard it. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;let them pour milk-water over the seat I sat in, to wash it! When I am king, I will wash the place with the blood of the hearts!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When he returned to Sāvatthi, the courtiers told the whole matter to the king. The king was enraged against the Sakyas for giving him a slave&rsquo;s daughter to marry. He cut off all allowances made to Vāsabhakhattiyā and her son, and gave them only what is proper to be given to slave men and women.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Some few days later the Teacher came to the palace, and took a seat. The king approached him, and with a greeting said: &ldquo;Sir, I am told that your clansmen gave me a slave&rsquo;s daughter to marry. I have cut off their allowances, mother and son, and grant them only what slaves would get.&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;The Sakyas have done wrong, O great king! </span><span class="t18">{4.148}</span><a id="a10660"></a><span class="t30"> If they gave any one, they ought to have given a girl of their own blood. But, O king, this I say: Vāsabhakhattiyā is a king&rsquo;s daughter, and in the house of a noble king she has received the ceremonial sprinkling; Viḍūḍabha too was begotten by a noble king. Wise men of old have said, what matters the mother&rsquo;s birth? The birth of the father is the measure; and to a poor wife, a picker of sticks, they gave the position of queen consort; and the son born of her obtained the sovereignty of Benares, twelve leagues in extent, and became king Kaṭṭhavāhana, the wood-carrier,&rdquo; whereupon he told him the story of the Kaṭṭhahārijātaka [Ja 7].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the king heard this speech he was pleased; and saying to himself, &ldquo;The father&rsquo;s birth is the measure of the man,&rdquo; he again gave mother and son the treatment suited to them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now the king&rsquo;s commander-in-chief was a man named Bandhula. His wife, Mallikā, was barren, and he sent her away to Kusināra, telling her to return to her own family. &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;when I have saluted the Teacher.&rdquo; She went to Jetavana, and greeting the Tathāgata stood waiting on one side. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked. She replied, &ldquo;My husband has sent me home, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the Teacher. &ldquo;I am barren, sir, I have no son.&rdquo; &ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is no reason why you should go. Return.&rdquo; She was much pleased, and saluting the Teacher went home again. Her husband </span><span class="t18">[4.94] </span><span class="t30">asked her why she had come back. She answered, &ldquo;The One with Ten Powers sent me back, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the commander-in-chief, &ldquo;the Tathāgata must have seen good reason.&rdquo; The woman soon after conceived, and when her cravings began, told him of it. &ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I desire to go and bathe and drink the water of the tank in Vesāli City where the families of the kings get water for the ceremonial sprinkling.&rdquo; The commander-in-chief promised to try. Seizing his bow, strong as a thousand bows, he put his wife in a chariot, and left Sāvatthi, and drove his chariot to Vesālī.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10661"></a><a id="a10662"></a><span class="t30">Now at this time there lived close to the gate a Licchavi named Mahāli,</span><a id="a10663"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15971"><span class="t9">{826}</span></a><span class="t30"> who had been educated by the same teacher as the king of Kosala&rsquo;s general, Bandhula. This man was blind, and used to advise the Licchavis on all matters temporal and spiritual. Hearing the clatter of the chariot as it went over the threshold, he said: &ldquo;The noise of the chariot of Bandhula the Mallian! </span><span class="t18">{4.149}</span><span class="t30"> This day there will be fear for the Licchavis!&rdquo; By the tank there was set a strong guard, within and without; above it was spread an iron net; not even a bird could find room to get through. But the general, dismounting from his carriage, put the guards to flight with the blows of his sword, and burst through the iron network, and in the tank bathed his wife and gave her to drink of the water; then after bathing himself, he set Mallikā in the chariot, and left the town, and went back by the way he came.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The guards went and told all to the Licchavis. Then were the kings of the Licchavis angry; and five hundred of them, mounted in five hundred chariots, departed to capture Bandhula the Mallian. They informed Mahāli of it, and he said: &ldquo;Go not! For he will slay you all.&rdquo; But they said: &ldquo;Nay, but we will go.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then if you come to a place where a wheel has sunk up to the nave, you must return. If you return not then, return back from that place when you hear the noise of a thunderbolt. If then you turn not, turn back from that place where you shall see a hole in front of your chariots. Go no further!&rdquo; But they did not turn back according to his word, but pursued on and on.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Mallikā espied them and said: &ldquo;There are chariots in sight, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then tell me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when they all look like one chariot.&rdquo; When they all in a line looked like one, she said: &ldquo;My lord, I see as it were the head of one chariot.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take the reins, then,&rdquo; said he, and gave the reins into her hand; he stood upright in the chariot, and strung his bow. The chariot-wheel sank into the earth nave-deep. The Licchavis came to the place, and saw it, but turned not back. The other went on a little further, and twanged the bow string; then came a noise as the noise of a thunderbolt, yet even then they turned not, but pursued on and on. Bandhula stood up in the chariot and sped a shaft, and it cleft the heads of all the five hundred chariots, and passed right through the five hundred kings in the place where the girdle is fastened, and then buried itself in the earth. As they did not perceive that they were wounded they pursued still, shouting, &ldquo;Stop, holloa, stop!&rdquo; Bandhula stopped his chariot, and said: &ldquo;You are dead men, and I cannot fight with the dead.&rdquo; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;dead, such as we now are?&rdquo; &ldquo;Loose the girdle of the first man,&rdquo; said Bandhula. </span><span class="t18">{4.150}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10664"></a><span class="t30">They loosed his girdle, and at the instant the girdle was loosed, he fell dead. Then he said to them, &ldquo;You are all of you in the same condition; go to your homes, and set in order what should be ordered, and give your directions to your wives and families, and then doff your armour.&rdquo; They did so, and then all of them gave up the ghost.</span><a id="a10665"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15973"><span class="t9">{827}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">And Bandhula conveyed Mallikā to Sāvatthi. She bore twin sons sixteen times in succession, and they were all mighty men and heroes, and became perfected in all manner of accomplishments. Each one of them had a thousand </span><span class="t18">[4.95] </span><span class="t30">men to attend him, and when they went with their father to wait on the king, they alone filled the courtyard of the palace to overflowing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">One day some men who had been defeated in court on a false charge, seeing Bandhula approach, raised a great outcry, and informed him that the judges of the court had supported a false charge. So Bandhula went into the court, and judged the case, and gave each man his own. The crowd uttered loud shouts of applause. The king asked what it meant, and on hearing was much pleased; all those officers he sent away, and gave Bandhula charge of the judgement court, and thenceforward he judged aright. Then the former judges became poor, because they no longer received bribes, and they slandered Bandhula in the king&rsquo;s ear, accusing him of aiming at the kingdom himself. The king listened to their words, and could not control his suspicions. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;if he be slain here, I shall be blamed.&rdquo; He instigated certain men to harry the frontier districts; then sending for Bandhula, he said: &ldquo;The borders are in a blaze; go with your sons and capture the brigands.&rdquo; With him he also sent other men sufficient, mighty men of war, with instructions to kill him and his two-and-thirty sons, and cut off their heads, and bring them back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">While he was yet on the way, the hired brigands got wind of the general&rsquo;s coming, and took to flight. He settled the people of that district in their homes, and quieted the province, and set out for home. Then when he was not far from the city, those warriors cut off his head and the heads of his sons.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On that day Mallikā had sent an invitation to the two chief disciples along with five hundred of the monks. Early in the forenoon a letter was brought to her, with news that her husband and sons had lost their heads. </span><span class="t18">{4.151}</span><a id="a10666"></a><span class="t30"> When she heard this, without a word to a soul, she tucked the letter in her dress, and waited upon the company of the monks. Her attendants had given rice to the monks, when bringing in a bowl of ghee they happened to break the bowl just in front of the elders. Then the Captain of the Dhamma said: &ldquo;Pots are made to be broken; do not trouble about it.&rdquo; The lady produced her letter from the fold of her dress, saying: &ldquo;Here I have a letter informing me that my husband and his two-and-thirty sons have been beheaded. If I do not trouble about that, am I likely to trouble when a bowl is broken?&rdquo; The Captain of the Dhamma now began, &ldquo;Unseen, unknown,&rdquo;</span><a id="a10667"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15975"><span class="t9">{828}</span></a><span class="t30"> and so forth, then rising from his seat uttered a discourse, and went home.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">She summoned her two-and-thirty daughters-in-law, and to them said: &ldquo;Your husbands, though innocent, have reaped the fruit of their former deeds. Do not you grieve, nor commit a wrong worse even than the king&rsquo;s.&rdquo; This was her advice. The king&rsquo;s spies hearing this speech brought word to him that they were not angry. Then the king was distressed, and went to her dwelling, and craving pardon of Mallikā and her sons&rsquo; wives, offered a boon. She replied, &ldquo;Be it accepted.&rdquo; She set out the funeral feast, and bathed, and then went before the king. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you granted me a boon. I want nothing but this, that you permit my two-and-thirty daughters-in-law and me to go back to our own homes.&rdquo; The king consented. Each of her two-and-thirty sons&rsquo; wives she sent away to her home, and herself returned to the home of her family in the city of Kusināra. And the king gave the post of commander-in-chief to one Dīgha-kārāyana, sister&rsquo;s son to the general Bandhula. But he went about picking faults in the king and saying: &ldquo;He murdered my uncle.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Ever after the murder of the innocent Bandhula the king was devoured by remorse, and had no peace of mind, felt no joy in being king.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10668"></a><span class="t30">At that time the Teacher dwelt near a country town of the Sakyas, named Uḷumpa. There went the king, pitched a camp not far from the park, and with a few attendants went to the monastery to salute the Teacher. The five symbols of royalty</span><a id="a10669"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15977"><span class="t9">{829}</span></a><a id="a10670"></a><span class="t30"> he handed to Kārāyana, and alone entered the Perfumed Chamber. All that followed must be described as in the Dhammacetiyasutta [MN 89]. When he </span><span class="t18">[4.96] </span><span class="t30">entered the Perfumed Chamber, Kārāyana took those symbols of royalty, </span><span class="t18">{4.152}</span><span class="t30"> and made Viḍūḍabha king; and leaving behind for the king one horse and a serving woman, he went to Sāvatthi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10671"></a><span class="t30">After a pleasant conversation with the Teacher, the king on his return saw no army. He enquired of the woman, and learned what had been done. Then set out for the city of Rājagaha, resolved to take his nephew with him,</span><a id="a10672"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15979"><span class="t9">{830}</span></a><span class="t30"> and capture Viḍūḍabha. It was late when he came to the city, and the gates were shut; and lying down in a shed, exhausted by exposure to wind and sun, he died there.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the night began to grow brighter, the woman began to wail, &ldquo;My lord, the king of Kosala is past help!&rdquo; The sound was heard, and news came to the king. He performed the obsequies of his uncle with great magnificence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10673"></a><span class="t30">Viḍūḍabha once firmly established on the throne remembered that grudge of his, and determined to destroy the Sakyas one and all; to which end he set out with a large army. That day at dawn the Teacher, looking forth over the world, saw destruction threatening his kin. &ldquo;I must help my kindred,&rdquo; thought he. In the forenoon he went in search of alms, then after returning from his meal lay down lion-like in his Perfumed Chamber, and in the evening-time, having past through the air to a spot near Kapilavatthu, sat beneath a tree that gave scanty shade. Hard by that place, a huge and shady banyan tree stood on the boundary of Viḍūḍabha&rsquo;s realms. Viḍūḍabha seeing the Teacher approached and saluting him, said: &ldquo;Why, sir, are you sitting under so thin a tree in all this heat? Sit beneath this shady banyan, sir.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;Let be, O king! The shade of my kindred keeps me cool.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Teacher,&rdquo; thought the other, &ldquo;must have come here to protect his clansmen.&rdquo; So he saluted the Teacher, and returned again to Sāvatthi. And the Teacher rising went to Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10674"></a><span class="t30">A second and a third time the king called to mind his grudge against the Sakyas, a second and a third time he set forth, and again saw the Teacher seated in the same place, then again returned.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">A fourth time he set out; and the Teacher, scanning the former deeds of the Sakyas, perceived that nothing could do away with the effect of their evildoing, in casting poison into the river; so he did not go there the fourth time. Then king Viḍūḍabha slew all the Sakyas, beginning with babes at the breast, and with the blood of the hearts washed the bench, and returned.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">On the day after the Teacher had gone out for the third time and returned, he, </span><span class="t18">{4.153}</span><span class="t30"> having gone his rounds for alms, and his meal over, was resting in his Perfumed Chamber, the monks gathered from all directions into the Dhamma Hall, and seating themselves, began to tell of the virtues of the Great Being, &ldquo;Sirs, the Teacher but showed himself, and turned the king back, and set free his kinsmen from fear of death. A helpful friend is the Teacher to his clan!&rdquo; The Teacher entered, and asked what they talked about as they sat there. They told him. Then he said: &ldquo;Not only now, monks, does the Tathāgata act for the benefit of his kinsmen; he did the same long ago.&rdquo; With these words, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta ruled as king in Benares, and observed the Ten Royal Virtues, he thought to himself, &ldquo;All over Jambudīpa the kings live in palaces supported by many a column. There is no marvel, then, in a palace supported by many columns; but what if I make a palace with one column only to support it? Then I shall be the leading king of all kings!&rdquo; So he summoned his builders, and told them to build him a magnificent palace supported on one column. &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; they said, and away they went into the forest.</p>
<p class="p7">There they beheld many a tree, straight and great, worthy to be the <span class="t18">[4.97] </span>single column of such a palace. &ldquo;Here are these trees,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;but the road is rough, and we can never transport them; we will go ask the king about it.&rdquo; When they did so, the king said: &ldquo;By hook or by crook you must bring them, and quickly.&rdquo; But they answered, &ldquo;Neither by hook nor by crook can the thing be done.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;Search for a tree in my park.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10675"></a>The builders went to the park, and there they espied a lordly Sāl tree, straight and well grown, worshipped by village and town, and to it the royal family also were wont to pay tribute and worship; and they told the king. Said the king, &ldquo;In my park you have found me a tree, good &ndash; go and cut it down.&rdquo; &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; they said, and repaired to the park, with their hands full of perfumed garlands and the like; then hanging upon it a five-spray garland,<a id="a10676"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15981"><span class="t9">{831}</span></a> and encircling it with a string, fastening to it a nosegay of flowers, and kindling a lamp, they did worship, explaining, <span class="t18">{4.154}</span> &ldquo;On the seventh day from now we shall cut down this tree; it is the king&rsquo;s command so to cut it down. Let the deities who dwell in this tree go elsewhere, and not unto us be the blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Devaputta who dwelt in the tree hearing this, thought to himself, &ldquo;These builders are determined to cut down this tree, and to destroy my place of dwelling. Now my life only lasts as long as this my abiding place. And all the young Sāl trees that stand around this, where dwell the deities my kinsfolk, and they are many, will be destroyed. My own destruction does not touch me so near as the destruction of my children: therefore I must protect their lives.&rdquo; Accordingly at the hour of midnight, adorned in divine splendour, he entered into the magnificent chamber of the king, and filling the whole chamber with a bright radiance, stood weeping beside the king&rsquo;s pillow. At sight of him the king, overcome by terror, uttered the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Who are you, standing high in air, with heavenly vesture swathed:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whence come your fears, why flow the tears in which thine eyes are bathed?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing which the King of the Devas repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Within your realm, O king, they know me as the Lucky Tree:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For sixty thousand years I stood, and all have worshipped me.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. Though many a town and house they made, and many a king&rsquo;s dwelling,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet me they never did molest, to me no harm did bring:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then even as they did worship pay, so worship you, O king!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.155}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the king repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;But such another mighty trunk I never yet did see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So fine a kind in girth and height, so thick and strong a tree.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. A lovely palace I will build, one column for support;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There I will place you to abide &ndash; your life shall not be short.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.98]</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the King of the Devas repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Since you are bent to tear my body from me, cut me small,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And cut me piecemeal limb from limb, O king, or not at all. </span><span class="t18">{4.156}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Cut first the top, the middle next, then last the root of me:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And if you cut me so, O king, death not will painful be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the king repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;First hands and feet, then nose and ears, while yet the victim lives,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And last of all the head let fall &ndash; a painful death this gives.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. O Lucky Tree! O woodland king! What pleasure couldst you feel,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why, for what reason do you wish to be cut up piecemeal?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Lucky Tree answered by repeating two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;The reason (and a reason &rsquo;tis full noble) why piecemeal</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I would be cut, O mighty king! Come listen while I tell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. My kith and kin all prospering round me well-sheltered grow;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">These I should crush by one huge fall &ndash; and great would be their woe.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.157}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king, hearing this, was much pleased, &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis a worthy Devaputta this,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;he does not wish that his kinsfolk should lose their dwelling-place because he loses his; he acts for his kinsfolk&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; And he repeated the remaining verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;O Lucky Tree! O woodland king! Your thoughts must noble be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You would befriend your kindred, so from fear I set you free.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The King of the Devas, having discoursed to this king, then departed. And the king being established according to his admonition, gave gifts and did other good deeds, till he went to fill the hosts of heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher having ended this discourse said: &ldquo;Thus it is, monks, that the Tathāgata acts so as to do good to his kith and kin,&rdquo; and then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was the king, the followers of the Buddha were the deities which were embodied in the young saplings of the Sāl tree, and I was myself Lucky Tree, the King of the Devas.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present both Devadatta and the families that supported him are doomed through their opposition to the Buddha. The latter tells a story of some carpenters who, having sailed to an island, offended the Yakkhas who inhabited the place, who then threatened to destroy them; some listened and some ignored the warnings and were destroyed by a tsunami.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Others sow.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{4.158}</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, about Devadatta, when he had gone down into hell, taking with him five hundred families. </span><span class="t18">[4.99]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10686"></a><span class="t30">Now Devadatta, when the chief disciples</span><a id="a10687"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15983"><span class="t9">{832}</span></a><a id="a10688"></a><span class="t30"> had gone away, taking his followers with them,</span><a id="a10689"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15985"><span class="t9">{833}</span></a><a id="a10690"></a><a id="a10691"></a><a id="a10692"></a><span class="t30"> being unable to swallow his pain, spat up hot blood from his mouth, and departed; then tormented by great agony, as he remembered the virtues of the Tathāgata, he said to himself, &ldquo;For nine months I have thought evil of the Tathāgata, but in the Teacher&rsquo;s heart is never a sinful thought for me; in the eighty chief elders is no malice towards me; by my own deeds that I have done I am become all forlorn, and I am renounced by the Teacher, by the great elders, by elder Rāhula chief of my family,</span><a id="a10693"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15987"><span class="t9">{834}</span></a><span class="t30"> and by all the royal clans of the Sakyas. I will go to the Teacher, and reconcile myself with him.&rdquo; So beckoning to his followers, he caused himself to be carried in a litter, and travelling always by night he made his way to the city of Kosala.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10694"></a><span class="t30">Ānanda the elder told the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;Devadatta is coming, they say, to make his peace with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ānanda, Devadatta shall not see me.&rdquo; Again when he had arrived at the city of Sāvatthi, the elder told it to the Teacher; and the Fortunate One replied as before. When he was at the gate of Jetavana, and moving towards the Jetavana lake, his wrongdoing came to a head: a fever arose in his body, and desiring to bathe and drink, he commanded them to let him out of the litter, that he might drink. No sooner had he alighted, and stood upon the ground, and before he could refresh himself, the great earth gaped, a flame arose from the nethermost hell of Avīci and surrounded him. Then he knew that his wrong deeds had come to a head, and remembering the virtues of the Tathāgata, he repeated this verse:</span><a id="a10695"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15989"><span class="t9">{835}</span></a></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">With these my bones to that supreme Being,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Marked with one hundred lucky marks, all-seeing,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">God, more than God, who man&rsquo;s bull-spirit tames,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">With my soul to Buddha I am fleeing!</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a10696"></a><span class="t30">But in the very act of taking refuge, he was doomed to the hell Avīci. And there were five hundred families of his attendants, which families following him reviled the One with Ten Powers, and abused him, and in the Avīci hell were born, they also. Thus he went to Avīci, taking with him five hundred families.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So one day they were talking in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Monk, the sinful Devadatta, </span><span class="t18">{4.159}</span><a id="a10697"></a><span class="t30"> through greed of gain, set his anger without cause against the Supreme Buddha, and with no regard for the terrors of the future, with five hundred families was doomed to hell.&rdquo; The Teacher entered and asked of what they were speaking, and they told him. Said he, &ldquo;Monks, Devadatta being greedy of gain and honour had no eye for the terrors of the future; and in former times, as now, regarding not the terrors of the future, he with his followers through greed of present happiness came to utter ruin.&rdquo; So saying, he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, there stood near Benares a great town of carpenters, containing a thousand families. The carpenters from this town used to profess that they would make a bed, or a chair, or a house, and after receiving a large advance from men&rsquo;s hands, they proved able to make nothing whatever. The people used to upbraid every carpenter they met with, and interfered <span class="t18">[4.100] </span>with them. So those debtors were so much harassed that they could live there no longer. &ldquo;Let us go into some foreign land,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and find some place or other to dwell in,&rdquo; so to the forest they went.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10698"></a>They cut down trees, they built a mighty ship, and launched her in the river, and took her away from that town, and at a distance of some three-quarters of a league<a id="a10699"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15991"><span class="t9">{836}</span></a> they laid her up. Then in the middle of the night they returned to the town to fetch their families, whom they conveyed on board ship, and then proceeded in due course to the ocean. There they sailed at the wind&rsquo;s will, until they reached an island that lay in the midst of the sea. Now in that island grew all manner of wild plants and wild fruit trees, rice, sugar-cane, banana, mango, Jambu plum, jack, coconut, and what not. There was another man who had been shipwrecked and had taken possession of that island before them, and lived therein, eating the rice and enjoying the sugar-cane and all the rest, by which he had grown stout and sturdy; naked he went, and his hair and beard were grown long. The carpenters thought: &ldquo;If yonder island is haunted of Yakkhas, we shall all perish; so we will explore it.&rdquo; Then seven brave and strong men, <span class="t18">{4.160}</span><a id="a10700"></a> armed them with the five kinds of weapons,<a id="a10701"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15993"><span class="t9">{837}</span></a> disembarked and explored that island.</p>
<p class="p7">At that moment the castaway had just broken his fast, and drunk of the juice of the sugar-cane, and in high contentment was lying on his back in a lovely spot, cool in the shade on some sand which glistered like silver plate; and he was thinking: &ldquo;No such happiness as this have they who dwell in Jambudīpa, that plough and sow; better to me is this island than Jambudīpa!&rdquo; He uttered this exalted utterance, and was at the height of bliss.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to explain how this castaway uttered this exalted utterance, repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Others sow and others plough,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Living by the sweat o&rsquo; the brow;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In my realm they have no share:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Jambudīpa? This better far!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The scouts who were exploring the isle caught the sound of his singing, and said: &ldquo;It seems the voice of man that we hear; let us make acquaintance with him.&rdquo; Following the sound, they came upon the man, but his aspect horrified them. &ldquo;It is a Yakkha!&rdquo; they cried, and put arrow to bow. When the man saw them, he was in fear of being wounded, so he called out, &ldquo;I am no Yakkha, sirs, but a man: spare my <span class="t18">[4.101] </span>life!&rdquo; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;do men go all naked and defenceless like you?&rdquo; and asked him again and again, only to receive the same answer, that he was a man.</p>
<p class="p7">At last they approached him, and all began to talk pleasantly together, and the newcomers asked how he came there. The other told them the truth of it. &ldquo;As a reward for your good deeds you have come here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is a first-rate island. No need here to work with your hands for a living; of rice and sugar-cane, and all the rest, there is no end here, and all growing wild; you may live here without anxiety.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is there nothing else,&rdquo; they asked, <span class="t18">{4.161}</span><a id="a10702"></a> &ldquo;to hinder our living here?&rdquo; &ldquo;No fear is there but this, the isle is haunted by Amanussas, and the Amanussas would be incensed to see the excretions of your bodies; so when you would relieve yourselves, dig a hole in the sand and hide it there. That is the only danger; there is no other; only always be careful on this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then they took up their abode in the place.</p>
<p class="p7">But among these thousand families there were two master workmen, one at the head of each five hundred of them; and one of these was foolish and greedy of the best food, the other wise and not bent on getting the best of everything.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10703"></a>In course of time as they continued to dwell there, all grew stout and sturdy. Then they thought: &ldquo;We have not been merry men this long time,<a id="a10704"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15995"><span class="t9">{838}</span></a> we will make some toddy from the juice of the sugar-cane.&rdquo; So they caused the strong drink to be made, and being drunken, sang, danced, sported, then in thoughtlessness relieved themselves here, there, and everywhere without hiding it, so that they made the island foul and disgusting.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10705"></a>The deities were incensed because these men made their playing-place all foul. &ldquo;Shall we bring the sea over it,&rdquo; they deliberated, &ldquo;and cleanse the island? This is the dark fortnight; now our gathering is broken up. Well, on the fifteenth day from now, at the first of the full moon, at the time of the moon&rsquo;s rising, we will bring up the sea and make an end of them all.&rdquo; Thus they fixed the day. At this a righteous Devaputta who was one of them thought: &ldquo;I would not that these should perish before my eyes.&rdquo; So in his compassion, at the time when the men were sitting at their doors in pleasant converse, after their evening meal, he made the whole island one blaze of light, and adorned in all splendour stood poised in the air towards the north, and spoke to them thus, &ldquo;O you carpenters! The deities are angry with you. Dwell no longer in this place, for in half a month from this time, the <span class="t18">[4.102] </span>deities will bring up the sea, <span class="t18">{4.162}</span> and destroy you one and all. Therefore flee from this place.&rdquo; And he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;In thrice five days the moon will rise to view:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then from the sea a mighty flood is due</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This mighty island to o&rsquo;erwhelm: then haste,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Elsewhere take shelter, that it hurt not you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">With this advice, he returned to his own place. He gone, another comrade of his, a cruel Devaputta, thought: &ldquo;Perhaps they will follow his advice and escape; I will prevent their going, and bring them all to utter destruction.&rdquo; So adorned in divine splendour, he made a great blaze of light over the whole place, and approaching them, remained poised in the air towards the south, as he asked, &ldquo;Has there been a Devaputta here?&rdquo; &ldquo;There has,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;What did he tell you?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Thus and thus, my lord.&rdquo; He then said: &ldquo;This god does not wish you to live here, and in anger speaks. Go not elsewhere, but stay even here.&rdquo; And with these words, he repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;To me by many signs it is made clear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That mighty ocean flood of which you hear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Shall never this great island overwhelm:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then take your pleasure, grieve not, never fear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Here you have lit upon a wide abode,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Full of all things to eat, of drink and food;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I see no danger for you: come, enjoy</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unto all generations this your good.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.163}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Having thus in these two verses offered to relieve their anxiety, he departed. When he was gone, the foolish carpenter lifted up his voice, and paying no heed to the saying of the righteous Devaputta, he cried, &ldquo;Let your honours listen to me!&rdquo; and addressed all the carpenters in the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;That god, who from the southern quarter clear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cries out, &lsquo;All safe!&rsquo; From him the truth we hear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fear or fear not, the northern knows no whit:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why grieve, then? Take your pleasure &ndash; never fear!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing him, the five hundred carpenters who were greedy of good things inclined to the counsel of the foolish carpenter. But then the wise carpenter refused to hearken to his saying, and addressing the carpenters repeated four verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;While these two Yakkhas &rsquo;gainst each other cry,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">One calling fear, and one security,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come hear advice, lest soon and out of hand</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You all together perish utterly.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Let us join all to build a mighty bark,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A vessel stout, and place within this ark</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All fittings: if this southern spoke the truth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And the other said but folly, off the mark. </span><span class="t18">[4.103]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. This vessel for us good at need shall be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor will we leave this isle incontinent;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But if the northern god spake truthfully,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The southern did but foolishness present &ndash; </span><span class="t18">{4.164}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then in the ship we all embark together,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And where our safety lies, all hie us there.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Take not for best or worst what first you hear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But whoso lets all pass within the ear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And then deliberating takes the mean,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10706"></a><span class="t12">That man to safest harbourage will steer.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10707"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15997"><span class="t19">{839}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">After this, he again said: &ldquo;Come now, let us follow the words of both the deities. Let us build a ship, and then if the words of the first be true, into that ship we will climb and depart; but if the words of the other be true, we will put the ship out of the way, and dwell here.&rdquo; When he had thus spoken, said the foolish carpenter: <span class="t18">{4.165}</span> &ldquo;Go to! You see a crocodile in a teacup! You are far too slow! The first Devaputta spake in anger against us, the second in affection. If we leave this choicest of isles, whither shall we go? But if you needs must go, take your tail with you, and make your ship, we want no ship, we!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10708"></a>The wise man with those that followed him, built a ship, and put all the fittings aboard, and he and the whole company stood in the ship. Then on the day of the full moon, at the time of moon-rising, up front the ocean a wave arose, and knee-deep it swept over the whole island. The wise man, when he observed the rising of the wave, cast loose the ship. Those of the foolish carpenter&rsquo;s party, five hundred families they were, sat still, saying to one another, &ldquo;A wave has arisen, to sweep over the island, but it will be no deeper.&rdquo; Then the ocean-wave rose waist-deep, man-deep, deep as a palm tree, as seven palm trees, and over the whole island it rolled. The wise man, having skill in means, not snared by greed of good things, departed in safety; but the foolish carpenter, greedy of good things, not regarding the fear of the future, with five hundred families was destroyed.</p>
<p class="p7">The other three verses, full of instruction, illustrating this matter, are verses spoken after Fully Awakening:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;As through mid-ocean, by the deeds they did,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The traders they escaped in happiness:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So wise men, comprehending what lies hid</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Within the future, will no jot transgress.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. Fools in their folly, eaten up with greed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who future dangers do not comprehend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sink overwhelmed, in face of present need,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As these in middest-ocean found their end. </span><span class="t18">[4.104] {4.166}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. Accomplish then the deed before the need,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let not lack hurt me of the needful thing.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who timely do the necessary deed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Come time, come never into suffering.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: &ldquo;Not now for the first time, monks, but formerly also, has Devadatta been ensnared by pleasures of the present, and without a look to the future, has come to destruction with all his companions.&rdquo; So saying, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time, Devadatta was the foolish carpenter, Kokālika was the unrighteous Devaputta that stood in the southern region, Sāriputta was the Devaputta who stood in the northern part, and I was myself the wise carpenter.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a10718"></a><span class="t30">A brahmin, so they say, who dwelt at Sāvatthi, was felling trees on the bank of the Aciravatī, in order to cultivate the land. The Teacher, when he visited Sāvatthi for alms, perceiving his destiny,</span><a id="a10719"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15999"><span class="t9">{840}</span></a><a id="a10720"></a><span class="t30"> went out of his road to talk sweetly with him. &ldquo;What are you doing, brahmin?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;O Gotama,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I am cutting a space free for cultivation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;go on with your work, brahmin.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10721"></a><a id="a10722"></a><span class="t30">In the same manner the Teacher came and talked with him when the felled trunks were all away, and the man was clearing his acre, and again at plowing time, and at making the little embanked squares for water.</span><a id="a10723"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16001"><span class="t9">{841}</span></a><a id="a10724"></a><span class="t30"> Now on the day of sowing, the brahmin said: &ldquo;Today, O Gotama, is my plowing festival.</span><a id="a10725"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16003"><span class="t9">{842}</span></a><span class="t30"> When this corn is ripe, I will give alms in plenty to the Saṅgha, with the Buddha at their head.&rdquo; The Teacher accepted his offer, and went away. On another day he came, and saw the brahmin watching the corn. &ldquo;What are you doing, brahmin?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;Watching the corn, O Gotama!&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good, brahmin,&rdquo; said the Teacher, and away he went. Then the brahmin thought: &ldquo;How often Gotama the ascetic comes this way! Without doubt he wants food. Well, food I will give him.&rdquo; On the day when this thought came into his mind, when he went home, there he found the Teacher come also. Thereat arose in the brahmin a wondrous great confidence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10726"></a><span class="t30">By and by, when ripe was the corn, the brahmin resolved, tomorrow he would reap the field. But while he lay in bed, in the upper reaches of the Aciravatī the rain fell heavily; down came a flood, and carried the whole crop away to the sea, so that not one stalk was left. When the flood </span><span class="t18">[4.105] </span><span class="t30">subsided, and the brahmin beheld the destruction of his crops, he had not the strength to stand: pressing his hand to his heart &ndash; for he was overcome with great sorrow &ndash; he went weeping home, and lay down lamenting.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">In the morning the Teacher saw this brahmin overwhelmed with his woe, and he thought: &ldquo;I will be the brahmin&rsquo;s support.&rdquo; So next day, after his alms-round in Sāvatthi, on his return from receipt of food he sent the monks back to their monastery, and himself with the junior who attended him visited the man&rsquo;s house. </span><span class="t18">{4.168}</span><a id="a10727"></a><a id="a10728"></a><span class="t30"> When the brahmin heard of his coming, he took heart, thinking: &ldquo;My friend must be come for a kindly talk.&rdquo; He offered him a seat; the Teacher entering sat upon the seat indicated, and asked, &ldquo;Why are you downhearted, brahmin? What has happened to displease you?&rdquo; &ldquo;O Gotama!&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;from the time that I cut down the trees on the bank of the Aciravatī, you know what I have been doing. I have been going about, and promising gifts to you when that crop should be ripe: now a flood has carried off the whole crop, away to the sea, nothing is left at all! Grain has been destroyed to the amount of a hundred wagon-loads, and so I am deep in grief!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, will what is lost come back for grieving?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Gotama, that will it not.&rdquo; &ldquo;If that is so, why grieve? The wealth of beings in this world, or their corn, when they have it, they have it, and when it is gone, why, gone it is. No composite thing but is subject to destruction; do not brood over it.&rdquo; Thus comforting him, the Teacher repeated the Kāma discourse [Snp 4.1] as appropriate to his case. At the conclusion of the discourse, the mourning brahmin was established in the Fruit of the First Path. The Teacher having eased him of his pain, arose from his seat, and returned to the monastery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">All the town heard how the Teacher had found such a brahmin pierced with the pangs of grief, had consoled him and established him in the Fruit of the First Path.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10729"></a><span class="t30">The monks talked of it in the Dhamma Hall, &ldquo;Hear, sirs! The One with Ten Powers made friends with a brahmin, grew intimate, took his opportunity to declare the Dhamma to him, when pierced with the pangs of grief, eased him of pain, and established him in the Fruit of the First Path!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and asked, &ldquo;What do you speak of, monks, as you sit here together?&rdquo; They told him. He replied, &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, I have cured his grief, but I did the same long, long ago,&rdquo; and with these words he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, Brahmadatta king of Benares had two sons. To the elder he gave the viceroyalty, the younger he made commander-in-chief. Afterwards when Brahmadatta was dead, the courtiers were for making the elder son king by the ceremonial sprinkling. But he said: &ldquo;I care nought for a kingdom: let my younger brother have it.&rdquo; They begged and besought him, but he would have none of it; and the younger was sprinkled to be king. The elder cared not for the viceroyalty, or any such thing; and when they begged him to remain, and feed on the fat of the land, &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have nothing to do in this city,&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.169}</span> and he departed from Benares. To the frontier he went; and dwelt with a rich merchant&rsquo;s family, working with his own hands. These after a while, learning that he was a king&rsquo;s son, would not allow him to work, but waited upon him as a prince should be attended.</p>
<p class="p7">Now after a time the king&rsquo;s officers came to that village, for taking a survey of the fields. Then the merchant came to the prince, and said,<span class="t18"> [4.106]</span> &ldquo;My lord, we support you; will you send a letter to your younger brother, and procure for us remission of taxes?&rdquo; To this he agreed, and wrote as follows, &ldquo;I am living with the family of such a merchant; I pray you remit their taxes for my sake.&rdquo; The king consented, and so did. Thereupon all the villagers, and the people of the countryside, came to him, and said: &ldquo;Get our taxes remitted, and we will pay taxes to you.&rdquo; For them too he sent his petition, and got the taxes remitted. After that the people paid their taxes to him. Then his receipts and honour were great; and with this greatness grew his covetousness also. So by degrees he asked for all the district, he asked for the office of viceroy, and the younger brother gave it all. Then as his greed kept growing, he was not content even with viceroyalty, and determined to seize the kingdom; to which end he set out with a host of people, and taking up a position outside the city, sent a letter to his younger brother, &ldquo;Give me the kingdom, or fight for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The younger brother thought: &ldquo;This fool once refused kingdom, and viceroyalty, and all; and now says he, I will take it by battle! If I slay him in battle, it will be my shame; what care I for being king?&rdquo; So he sent a message, &ldquo;I have no wish to fight: you may have the kingdom.&rdquo; The other accepted it, and made his younger brother viceroy.</p>
<p class="p7">Thenceforward he ruled the kingdom. But so greedy was he, that one kingdom could not content him, but he craved for two kingdoms, then for three, <span class="t18">{4.170}</span> and yet saw no end to his greed.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10730"></a>At that time Sakka, King of the Gods, looked abroad, &ldquo;Who are they,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;carefully tend their parents? Who give alms and do good? Who are in the power of greed?&rdquo; He perceived that this man was subject to greed, &ldquo;That fool,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;is not satisfied with being king of Benares. Well, I will teach him a lesson.&rdquo; So in the guise of a young brahmin, he stood at the door of the palace, and sent in word, that at the door stood a young man having skill in means. He was admitted, and wished victory to the king; then the king said: &ldquo;Why have you come?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mighty king!&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I have a thing to say to you, but I desire privacy.&rdquo; By power of Sakka, at that very instant the people retired. Then said the young man, &ldquo;O great king! I know three cities, prosperous, thronged with men, strong in troops and horses, of these by my own power I will obtain the lordship, and deliver it to you. But you must make no delaying, and go at once.&rdquo; The king being full of covetise gave his consent. (But by Sakka&rsquo;s power he was prevented from asking, &ldquo;Who are you? Whence come? And what are you to receive?&rdquo;) So much Sakka said, and then returned to the abode of the Thirty-Three.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10731"></a>Then the king summoned his courtiers, and thus addressed them.<a id="a10732"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16005"><span class="t9">{843}</span></a><span class="t18"> [4.107] </span>&ldquo;A youth has been here, promising to capture and give me the lordship of three kingdoms! Go, look for him! Send the drum beating about the city, assemble the army, make no delay, for I am about to take three kingdoms!&rdquo; &ldquo;O great king!&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;did you offer hospitality to the young man, or did you ask where he dwelt?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no, I offered him no hospitality, I did not ask where he dwelt: go, and look for him!&rdquo; They searched, but found him not; they informed the king, they could not in the whole city find the young man. On hearing this the king became gloomy. &ldquo;The lordship over three cities is lost,&rdquo; he thought again and again, &ldquo;I am shorn of great glory. Doubtless the young man went away angry with me, that I gave him no money for his expenses, nor a place to dwell in.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{4.171}</span> Then in his body, full of greed, a burning arose; as the body burnt, his bowels were moved to a bloody flux; as the food went in, so it came out; physicians could not cure him, the king was exhausted. His illness was bruited abroad all through the city.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time, the Bodhisatta had returned to his parents in Benares from Taxila, after mastering all branches of learning. He hearing the news about the king, proceeded to the palace door, with intent to cure him, and sent in a message, that a young man was there ready to cure the king. The king said: &ldquo;Great and most renowned physicians, known far and near, are not able to cure me: what can a young lad do? Pay his expenses, and let him depart.&rdquo; The young man made answer, &ldquo;I want no fee for my physic, but I will cure him; let him simply and solely pay me the price of my remedy.&rdquo; When the king heard this, he agreed, and admitted him. The young man saluted the king, &ldquo;Fear nothing, O king!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will cure you; do but tell me the origin of your disorder.&rdquo; The king answered in wrath, &ldquo;What is that to you? Make up your medicine.&rdquo; &ldquo;O great king,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is the way of physicians, first to learn whence the disease arises, then to make a remedy to suit.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, well, my son,&rdquo; said the king, and proceeded to tell the origin of the disease, beginning where that young man had come, and made his promise, that he would take and give to him the lordship over three cities. &ldquo;Thus, my son, the disease arose from greed; now cure it if you can.&rdquo; &ldquo;What, O king!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;can you capture those cities by grieving?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why no, my son.&rdquo; &ldquo;Since that is so, why grieve, O great king? Everything, animate or inanimate, must pass away, and leave all behind, even its own body. <span class="t18">{4.172}</span> Even should you obtain rule over four cities, you could not at one time eat four plates of food, recline on four couches, wear four sets of robes. You ought not to be the slave of desire; for desire, when it increases, allows no release from the four states of suffering.&rdquo; Thus having admonished him, the Great Being declared the Dhamma in the following verses: <span class="t18">[4.108]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;He that desires a thing, and then this his desire fulfilment blesses,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. He that desires a thing, and then this his desire fulfilment blesses,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Desires throng on him more and more, as thirst in time of heat oppresses.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Would crave what might beyond the sea be found.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. Crush your desires, and little want, not greedy all to win:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He that is like the sea is not burnt by desire within,</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a10735"></a>But as the Bodhisatta was repeating these verses, his mind being concentrated on the king&rsquo;s white sunshade, there arose in him Absorption attained through focusing on the Meditation Object of white light.<a id="a10736"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16009"><span class="t9">{845}</span></a> The king on his part became whole and well; he arose in joy from his seat, and addressed him thus, &ldquo;When all those physicians could not heal me, a wise youth has made me whole by the medicine of his wisdom!&rdquo; And he then repeated the tenth verse: <span class="t18">{4.175}</span></p>

<p class="p6">&ldquo;Great king!&rdquo;said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;be circumspect, and walk in righteousness.&rdquo; Thus admonishing the king, he passed through the air to the Himālayas, and living the life of a recluse, while life lasted, cultivated the Divine Abidings, and became destined for the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This discourse ended, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Thus, monks, in former days as now, I made this brahmin whole,&rdquo; so saying, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time this brahmin was the king, and I was the wise young man.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the king of Kosala neglects attendance on the Buddha. The latter tells a story of a prince who taught his people the ten things to be practiced, which will bring suffering if they are not fulfilled.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a10746"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = king Janasandha (Janasandharājā),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">the Buddha&rsquo;s disciples = his rest of the cast (parisā).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a10747"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Good conduct, Virtue.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Thus spake.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.176}</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Jetavana, for the instruction of the king of Kosala.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10748"></a><span class="t30">At one time, they say the king, intoxicated with power, and devoted to the pleasures of wrongdoing, held no court of justice, and grew remiss in attending upon the Buddha. One day he remembered the One with Ten Powers; and thought: &ldquo;I must visit him.&rdquo; So after breaking his fast, he ascended his magnificent chariot, and proceeding to the monastery, greeted him and took a seat. &ldquo;How is it, great king,&rdquo; asked the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;that you have not showed yourself for so long?&rdquo; &ldquo;O, sir,&rdquo; replied the king, &ldquo;I have been so busy, that there has been no opportunity of waiting upon you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Great king,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is not good to neglect such as I am, a Supreme Buddha, who can give admonition, dwelling too in a monastery in front. A king ought to rule vigilant in all kingly duties, to his subjects like mother or father, forsaking all evil courses, never omitting the ten virtues of a king. When a king is righteous, those who surround him are righteous also. No marvel were it, in truth, if under my instruction you were to rule in righteousness; but wise men of old, even when there was no teacher to instruct them, by their own understanding established in the threefold practice of well-doing, declared the Dhamma to a great multitude of people, and with all their attendants went to swell the hosts of heaven.&rdquo; With these words, at his request, the Teacher told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10749"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born as son of his queen consort. They gave him the name of prince Janasandha. Now when he came of age, and had returned from Taxila, where he had been educated in all accomplishments, the king gave a general pardon to all prisoners, and gave him the viceroyalty. Afterwards when his father died, he became king, and then he caused to be built six alms houses: at the four gates of the city, in the <span class="t18">[4.110] </span><a id="a10750"></a><a id="a10751"></a>midst of it, and at the palace gate. There day by day he used to distribute six hundred thousand pieces of money, and stirred up all Jambudīpa with his generosity; the prison doors he opened for good and all, the places of execution he destroyed, all the world he protected with the four sorts of beneficence,<a id="a10752"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16015"><span class="t9">{848}</span></a> <span class="t18">{4.177}</span> he kept the five precepts, observed the holy Uposatha, and ruled in righteousness. From time to time he would gather together his subjects, and declare the Dhamma to them, &ldquo;Give alms, practise virtue, righteously follow your business and calling, educate yourselves in the days of your youth, gain wealth, do not behave like a village cheat or a dog, be not harsh nor cruel, do your duty in caring for mother and for father, in family life honour your elders.&rdquo; Thus he confirmed multitudes of people in good living.</p>
<p class="p7">Once on the holy day, fifteenth of the fortnight, having undertaken to keep the holy day, he thought to himself, &ldquo;I will declare the Dhamma to the multitudes, for the continual increase of good and blessing to them, and to make them vigilant in their life.&rdquo; Then he caused the drum to beat, and beginning with the women of his own household, gathered together all the people of the city. In the courtyard of his palace he sat, on a splendid couch set apart, beneath a pavilion adorned with jewels, and declared the Dhamma in these words, &ldquo;O people of the city! To you I will declare the practices that will cause you suffering, and those which will not. Be vigilant, and hear with care and attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher opened his mouth, a precious jewel among mouths, full of truth, and with a voice sweet as honey explained this address of the king of Kosala:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Thus spake king Janasandha: Ten things in truth there be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which if a man omit to do, he suffers presently.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Not to have got nor gathered store in time, the heart torments;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To think he sought no wealth before he afterwards repents.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. How hard is life for men untaught! He thinks, repenting sore</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That learning, which he now might use, he would not learn before.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. A slanderer once, dishonest once, a backbiter unkind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cruel, and harsh was I: good cause for sorrow now I find.</span><span class="t18"> {4.178}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. A slayer was I, merciless, and to no creature gave,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Contemptible: for this (said he) much sorrow now I have.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. When I had many wives (thinks he) to whom I owed their due,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I left them for another&rsquo;s wife; which now I dearly rue.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. When plenteous store of food and drink there was, he sorrows sore,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To think he never gave a gift in the old time before.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. He grieves to think that when he could, he would not care and tend</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10753"></a><span class="t12">Mother and father, now grown old, their youth now at an end.</span><a id="a10754"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16017"><span class="t19">{849}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">[4.111]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. To have slighted teacher, preceptor, or father, who would try</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To gratify his every wish, causes deep misery.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. To have treated brahmins with neglect, ascetics many a one</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Holy, and learned, in the past, makes him repent anon.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. Sweet is austerity performed, a good man honoured well:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That he did no such thing before &rsquo;tis sad to have to tell.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. Who these ten things in wisdom brings to full accomplishment,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And to all men his duty does, will never need repent.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.180}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus twice in the month did the Great Being discourse in the same way to the multitude. And the multitude, established in his admonition, fulfilled these ten things, and became destined for heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he said: &ldquo;Thus, O great king, wise men of old, untaught and from their own intelligence, declared the Dhamma, and established multitudes in the way to heaven.&rdquo; With these words, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the Buddha&rsquo;s followers were the people, and I was myself king Janasandha.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">In such words they praised the goodness and worth of the One with Ten Powers&rsquo; life for the good of the world. The Teacher came in, and asked what they talked about as they sat there? They told him. &ldquo;And no wonder, monks,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I who now in my perfect wisdom would live for the world&rsquo;s good, even I in the past, in the days of passion, lived for the good of the world.&rdquo; So saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10784"></a><a id="a10785"></a>In the past, in the days of the Supreme Buddha Kassapa, there reigned a king named Usīnara. It was a long time after the Supreme Buddha Kassapa had declared the Four Truths, and liberated multitudes of people from bondage, and had been translated to swell the number of those who dwell in Nibbāna; and the dispensation had fallen into decay. The monks gained their livelihood in the twenty-one unlawful ways;<a id="a10786"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16033"><span class="t9">{857}</span></a> they associated with the nuns, and sons and daughters were born to them; monks forsook the duties of the Saṅgha, and nuns forsook the duties of nuns, lay brethren and sisters the duties of such, brahmins no longer did the duties of a brahmin: men for the most part followed the ten paths of evil-doing, and as they died thus filled the hosts of all states of suffering.</p>
<p class="p7">Then Sakka, observing that no new deities came into being, looked abroad upon the world; and then he perceived how men were born into states of suffering, and that the dispensation of the Buddha had decayed. &ldquo;What shall I do, now?&rdquo; he wondered. &ldquo;Ah, I have it!&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;I will scare and terrify mankind; and when I see they are terrified, <span class="t18">[4.113]</span><a id="a10787"></a><a id="a10788"></a> I will console them, I will declare the Dhamma, I will restore dispensation which has decayed, I will make it last for another thousand years!&rdquo; With this resolve, he made the Devaputta Mātali<a id="a10789"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16035"><span class="t9">{858}</span></a> into the shape of a huge black hound, of pure breed, having four tusks as big as a plantain, horrible, with a hideous shape and a fat belly, as of a woman ready to be delivered of a child; him fastening with five-fold chain, <span class="t18">{4.182}</span> and putting on him a red wreath, he led by a cord. Himself he put on a pair of yellow garments, and bound his hair behind his head, and donned a red wreath; taking a huge bow, fitted with bowstring of the colour of coral, and twirling in his fingers a javelin tipped with adamant, he assumed the aspect of a forester, and descended at a spot one league away from the city. &ldquo;The world is doomed to destruction, is doomed to destruction!&rdquo; he called out thrice with a loud sound, so that he terrified the people; and when he reached the entering in of the city, he repeated the cry. The people on seeing the hound were frightened, and hasted into the city, and told the king what had happened.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10790"></a>The king speedily caused the city gates to be closed. But Sakka leapt over the wall, eighteen cubits in height, and with his hound stood within the city. The people in terror ran away into the houses, and made the doors fast. The Black Hound gave chase to every man he saw, and scared them, and finally entered into the king&rsquo;s palace. The people who in their fright had taken refuge in the courtyard, ran into the palace, and shut the door. And as for the king, he with the ladies of his household went up on the terrace. The Black Hound raised his forefeet, and putting them in at the window roared a great roar. The sound of his roaring reached from hell to the highest heaven; the whole universe was one great roar.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10791"></a><a id="a10792"></a><a id="a10793"></a><a id="a10794"></a>The three great roars that were the loudest ever heard in Jambudīpa are these: the cry of king Puṇṇaka in the Puṇṇakajātaka [Ja 545], the cry of the snake king Sudassana in the Bhūridattajātaka [Ja 543], and this roar in the Mahākaṇhajātaka [Ja 469], telling the story of the Black Hound.<a id="a10795"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16037"><span class="t9">{859}</span></a> The people were terrified and horrified, and not a man of them could say a word to Sakka.</p>
<p class="p7">The king plucked up heart, and approaching the window, cried out to Sakka, &ldquo;Ho, huntsman! <span class="t18">{4.183}</span> why did your hound roar?&rdquo; Said he, &ldquo;The hound is hungry.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;I will order some food to be given him.&rdquo; So he told them to give him his own food, and the food of all his household. The hound seemed to make but one mouthful of the whole, then roared again. Again the king put his question. &ldquo;My hound is still hungry,&rdquo; was the reply. Then he had all the food of <span class="t18">[4.114] </span>his elephants and horses and so forth brought and given to him. This also he finished off all at once; and then the king had all the food in the city given him. He swallowed this in like manner, and roared again. Said the king, &ldquo;This is no hound. Beyond all doubt he is a Yakkha. I will ask him wherefore he is come.&rdquo; So terrified with fear, he asked his question by repeating the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;A black, black hound, with five cords bound, with fangs all white of hue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Majestic, awful &ndash; mighty one! What makes he here with you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, Sakka repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Not to hunt game the Black Hound came, but he shall be of use</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To punish men, Usīnara, when I shall let him loose.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then said the king, &ldquo;What, huntsman! Will the hound devour the flesh of all men, <span class="t18">{4.184}</span> or of your enemies only?&rdquo; &ldquo;Only my enemies, great king.&rdquo; &ldquo;And who are your enemies?&rdquo; &ldquo;Those, O king, who love unrighteousness, and walk wickedly.&rdquo; &ldquo;Describe them to us,&rdquo; he asked. And the King of the Devas described them in the verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;When the false monks, bowl in hand, in one robe clad, shall choose</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10796"></a><span class="t12">Tonsured the plough to follow, then the Black Hound I will loose.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. When nuns of the Saṅgha shall in single robe be found,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tonsured, yet walking in the world, I will let loose the Hound.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. What time ascetics, usurers, protruding the upper lip,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Foul-toothed and filthy-haired shall be &ndash; the Black Hound I&rsquo;ll let slip.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. When brahmins, skilled in sacred books and holy rites, shall use</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their skill to sacrifice for pelf, the Black Hound shall go loose.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Whoso his parents now grown old, their youth now come to an end,</span></p>

<p class="p6">When he had thus spoken, &ldquo;These,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are my enemies, O king!&rdquo; and he made as though he would let the hound leap forth and devour all those who did the deeds of enemies. But as all the multitude was terror-struck, he held in the hound by the leash, and seemed as <span class="t18">[4.115] </span>it were to fix him to the spot; then putting off the disguise of a hunter, by his power he rose and poised himself in the air, all blazing as it appeared, and said: &ldquo;O great king, I am Sakka, King of the Devas! Seeing that the world was about to be destroyed, I came here. Now indeed men as they die are filling the states of suffering, because their deeds are evil, and heaven is become empty. From henceforth I will know how to deal with the wicked, but do you be vigilant.&rdquo; Then having in four verses well worth remembering declared the Dhamma, and established the people in the virtues of liberality, he strengthened the waning power of dispensation so that it lasted for yet another thousand years, and then with Mātali returned to his own place.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he added, &ldquo;Thus, monks, in former times as now I have lived for the good of the world,&rdquo; and then he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was Mātali, and I was Sakka.&rdquo;</span></p>
