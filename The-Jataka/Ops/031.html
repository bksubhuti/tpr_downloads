<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is always saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. The Buddha tells a story of how the same monk had indeed been faithful, but truly inept in his thinking in a past life.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the world-famous teacher (disāpāmokkho ācariyo),</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;The fool in all cases speaks a word.&rdquo;</span><a id="a2731"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the elder Lāḷudāyi who is said to have had a knack of always saying the wrong thing. He never knew the proper occasion for the several teachings. For instance, if it was a festival, he would croak out the gloomy text,</span><a id="a2732"></a><a href="notes.html#a14935"><span class="t9">{342}</span></a><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Without the walls they lurk, and where four cross-roads meet.&rdquo; If it was a funeral, he would burst out with,</span><a id="a2733"></a><a href="notes.html#a14937"><span class="t9">{343}</span></a><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Joy filled the hearts of gods and men,&rdquo; or with,</span><a id="a2734"></a><a href="notes.html#a14939"><span class="t9">{344}</span></a><a id="a2735"></a><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Oh may you see </span><span class="t18">{1.447}</span><span class="t30"> a hundred, nay a thousand such glad days!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now one day the monks in the Dhamma Hall commented on his singular infelicity of subject and his knack of always saying the wrong thing. As they sat talking, the Teacher entered, and, in answer to his question, was told the subject of their talk. &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is not the first time that Lāḷudāyi&rsquo;s folly has made him say the wrong thing. He has always been as inept as now.&rdquo; So saying he told this story of the past.</span><a id="a2736"></a><span class="t18"> [1.272]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into a rich brahmin&rsquo;s family, and when he grew up, was versed in all knowledge and was a world-renowned teacher with five hundred young brahmins to instruct.</p>
<p class="p7">At the time of our story there was among the young brahmins one who always had foolish notions in his head and always said the wrong thing; he was engaged with the rest in learning the scriptures as a pupil, but because of his folly could not master them. He was the devoted attendant of the Bodhisatta and ministered to him like a slave.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day after supper the Bodhisatta laid himself on his bed and there was washed and perfumed by the young brahmin on hands, feet and back. And as the youth turned to go away, the Bodhisatta said to him, &ldquo;Prop up the feet of my bed before you go.&rdquo; And the young brahmin propped up the feet of the bed on one side all right, but could not find anything to prop it up with on the other side. Accordingly he used his leg as a prop and passed the night so. When the Bodhisatta got up in the morning and saw the young brahmin, he asked why he was sitting there. &ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I could not find one of the bed supports; so I&rsquo;ve got my leg under to prop it up instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Moved at these words, the Bodhisatta thought: &ldquo;What devotion! And to think it should come from the most dull of all my pupils. How can I impart learning to him?&rdquo; And the thought came to him that the best way was to question the young brahmin on his return from gathering firewood and leaves, as to something he had seen or done that day; and then to ask what it was like. <span class="t18">{1.448}</span> &ldquo;For,&rdquo; thought the master, &ldquo;this will lead him on to making comparisons and giving reasons, and the continuous practice of comparing and reasoning on his part will enable me to impart learning to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Accordingly he sent for the young man and told him always on his return from picking up firewood and leaves to say what he had seen or eaten or drunk. And the young man promised he would. So one day having seen a snake when out with the other pupils picking up wood in the forest, he said: &ldquo;Teacher, I saw a snake.&rdquo; &ldquo;What did it look like?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, like the shaft of a plough.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is a very good comparison. Snakes are like the shafts of ploughs,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, who began to have hopes that he might at last succeed with his pupil.</p>
<p class="p7">Another day the young brahmin saw an elephant in the forest and told his master. &ldquo;And what is an elephant like?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, like the shaft of a plough.&rdquo; His master said nothing, for he thought that, as the elephant&rsquo;s trunk and tusks bore a certain resemblance to the shaft of a plough, perhaps his pupil&rsquo;s stupidity made him speak thus generally (though he was thinking of the trunk in particular), because of his inability to go into accurate detail.<a id="a2737"></a><span class="t18"> [1.273]</span></p>
<p class="p7">A third day he was invited to eat sugar-cane, and duly told his master. &ldquo;And what is a sugar-cane like?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, like the shaft of a plough.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is scarcely a good comparison,&rdquo; thought his master, but said nothing. Another day, again, the pupils were invited to eat molasses with curds and milk, and this too was duly reported. &ldquo;And what are curds and milk like?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, like the shaft of a plough.&rdquo; Then the master thought to himself, &ldquo;This young man was perfectly right in saying a snake was like the shaft of a plough, and was more or less right, though not accurate, in saying an elephant and a sugar-cane had the same similitude. But milk and curds (which are always white in colour) take the shape of whatever vessel they are placed in; <span class="t18">{1.449}</span> and here he missed the comparison entirely. This dullard will never learn.&rdquo; So saying he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Asabbatthagāmiṁ vācaṁ bālo sabbattha bhāsati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nāyaṁ dadhiṁ vedi, na naṅgalīsaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dadhippayaṁ maññati naṅgalīsan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">The fool in all cases speaks a word that is not applicable in all cases, he doesn&rsquo;t know curd, doesn&rsquo;t know a ploughshaft, he thinks that buttermilk is a ploughshaft.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a2738"></a><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Lāḷudāyi was the dullard of those days, and I the teacher of world-wide renown.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one monk is very virtuous in all his actions, and attracts a generous support for all who dwell with him. The Buddha tells a story of how once during a drought, when living as an ascetic, he had put aside his own needs to cater to watering the animals in the forest, and how they had repaid him.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a2744"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Virtue, Reward, Animals.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;A person must make an effort.&rdquo;</span><a id="a2745"></a><a id="a2746"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a good brahmin belonging to a noble Sāvatthi family who gave his heart to the dispensation, and going forth, became constant in all duties. Blameless in his attendance on teachers; scrupulous in the matter of foods and drinks; zealous in the performance of the duties of the chapter-house, bath-house, and so forth; perfectly punctual in the observance of the fourteen major and of the eighty minor disciplines; he used to sweep the monastery, the cells, the cloisters, and the path leading to their monastery, and gave water to thirsty folk. And because of his great goodness folk gave regularly five hundred meals a day to the monks; and great gain and honour accrued to the monastery, the many prospering for the virtues of one. And one day in the Dhamma Hall the monks fell to talking of how that monk&rsquo;s goodness had brought them gain and honour, and filled many lives with joy. Entering the Hall, </span><span class="t18">{1.450}</span><span class="t30"> the Teacher asked, and </span><a id="a2747"></a><span class="t18">[1.274]</span><span class="t30"> was told, what their talk was about. &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that this monk has been regular in the fulfilment of duties. In days gone by five hundred ascetics going out to gather fruits were supported on the fruits that his goodness provided.&rdquo; So saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a brahmin in the north, and, growing up, gave up the world and dwelt at the head of five hundred ascetics at the foot of the mountains. In those days there came a great drought upon the Himālayas, and everywhere the water was dried up, and sore distress fell upon all beasts. Seeing the poor creatures suffering from thirst, one of the ascetics cut down a tree which he hollowed into a trough; and this trough he filled with all the water he could find. In this way he gave the animals to drink. And they came in herds and drank and drank till the ascetic had no time left to go and gather fruits for himself. Heedless of his own hunger, he worked away to quench the animals&rsquo; thirst. Thought they to themselves, &ldquo;So wrapped up is this ascetic in ministering to our wants that he leaves himself no time to go in quest of fruits. He must be very hungry. Let us agree that everyone of us who comes here to drink must bring such fruits as he can to the ascetic.&rdquo; This they agreed to do, every animal that came bringing mangoes or jambus or breadfruits or the like, till their offerings would have filled two hundred and fifty wagons; and there was food for the whole five hundred ascetics with abundance to spare. Seeing this, the Bodhisatta exclaimed, &ldquo;Thus has one man&rsquo;s goodness been the means of supplying with food all these ascetics. Truly, we should always be steadfast in doing right.&rdquo; So saying, he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Vāyametheva puriso, na nibbindeyya paṇḍito,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vāyāmassa phalaṁ passa bhuttā ambā anītihan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">A person must make an effort, the wise one should not be weary, this is not just hearsay: having eaten the mangoes, see the fruit of the one who exerts himself. </span><span class="t18">{1.451}</span></p>
<p class="p23">Such was the teaching of the Great Being to the band of ascetics.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;This monk was the good ascetic of those days, and I the ascetics&rsquo; master.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Should he, having gone to another country.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[1.275]</span><a id="a2757"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a boastful monk. The introductory story about him is like what has already been related [Ja 80].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2758"></a><a id="a2759"></a><a id="a2760"></a><span class="t34">This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a certain braggart among the monks. Tradition says that he used to gather round him monks of all ages, and go about deluding everyone with lying boasts about his noble descent. &ldquo;Ah, monks,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no family so noble as mine, no lineage so peerless. I am a scion of the highest of princely lines; no man is my equal in birth or ancestral estate; there is absolutely no end to the gold and silver and other treasures we possess. Our very slaves and menials are fed on rice and meat-stews, and are clad in the best Benares cloth, with the choicest Benares perfumes to perfume themselves withal; while I, because I have joined the Saṅgha, have to content myself with this vile fare and this vile garb.&rdquo; But another monk, after enquiring into his family estate, exposed to the monks the emptiness of this pretension.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So the monks met in the Dhamma Hall, and talk began as to how that monk, in spite of his vows to leave worldly things and cleave only to the dispensation which leads to safety, was going about deluding the monks with his lying boasts. While the fellow&rsquo;s sinfulness was being discussed, the Teacher entered and enquired what their topic was. And they told him. &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;that he has gone about boasting; in bygone days too he went about boasting and deluding people.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2761"></a><a id="a2762"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a rich Treasurer, and his wife bore him a son. And the self-same day a female slave in his house gave birth to a boy, and the two children grew up together. And when the rich man&rsquo;s son was being taught to write, the young slave used to go with his young master&rsquo;s tablets and so learned at the same time to write himself. Next he learned two or three handicrafts, and grew up to be a fair-spoken and handsome young man; and his name was Kaṭāhaka [Vessel]. Being employed as private secretary, he thought to himself, &ldquo;I shall not always be kept at this work. The slightest fault and I shall be beaten, imprisoned, branded, and fed on slave&rsquo;s fare. On the border there lives a merchant, a friend of my master&rsquo;s. Why should I not go to him with a letter purporting to come from my master, and, passing myself off as my master&rsquo;s son, marry the merchant&rsquo;s daughter and live happily ever afterwards?</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2763"></a>So he wrote a letter, <span class="t18">{1.452}</span> saying: &ldquo;The bearer of this is my son. It is meet that our houses should be united in marriage, and I would have you give your daughter to this my son and keep the young couple near you for the present. As soon as I can conveniently do so, I will come to you.&rdquo; This letter he sealed with his master&rsquo;s private seal, and came to the border-merchant with a well-filled purse, handsome dresses, and perfumes and the like. And with a bow he stood before the merchant. &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; said the merchant. &ldquo;From Benares.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is your father?&rdquo; &ldquo;The Treasurer of Benares.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what brings you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;This letter will tell you,&rdquo; said Kaṭāhaka, handing it to him. The merchant read the letter and exclaimed, &ldquo;This gives me new life.&rdquo; And in his joy he gave his daughter to Kaṭāhaka and set up the young couple, who lived in great style. But Kaṭāhaka gave himself airs, and used to find fault with the victuals and the clothes that were brought him, calling them &lsquo;provincial.&rsquo; &ldquo;These misguided provincials,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;have <a id="a2764"></a><span class="t18">[1.276]</span> no idea of dressing. And as for taste in scents and garlands, they&rsquo;ve got none.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Missing his slave, the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see Kaṭāhaka. Where has he gone? Find him.&rdquo; And off went the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s people in quest of him, and searched far and wide till they found him. Then back they came without Kaṭāhaka recognizing them, and told the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;This will never do,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta on hearing the news. &ldquo;I will go and bring him back.&rdquo; So he asked the king&rsquo;s permission, and departed with a great following. And the tidings spread everywhere that the Treasurer was on his way to the borders. Hearing the news Kaṭāhaka fell to thinking of his course of action. He knew that he was the sole reason of the Treasurer&rsquo;s coming, and he saw that to run away now was to destroy all chance of returning. So he decided to go to meet the Treasurer, and conciliate him by acting as a slave towards him as in the old days. Acting on this plan, he made a point of proclaiming in <span class="t18">{1.453}</span> public on all occasions his disapprobation of the lamentable decay of respect towards parents which showed itself in children sitting down to meals with their parents, instead of waiting upon them. &ldquo;When my parents take their meals,&rdquo; said Kaṭāhaka, &ldquo;I hand the plates and dishes, bring the spittoon, and fetch their fans for them. Such is my invariable practice.&rdquo; And he explained carefully a slave&rsquo;s duty to his master, such as bringing the water, and ministering to him when he retired. And having already schooled folk in general, he had said to his father-in-law shortly before the arrival of the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;I hear that my father is coming to see you. You had better make ready to entertain him, while I will go and meet him on the road with a present.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do so, my dear boy,&rdquo; said his father-in-law.</p>
<p class="p7">So Kaṭāhaka took a magnificent present and went out with a large retinue to meet the Bodhisatta, to whom he handed the present with a low obeisance. The Bodhisatta took the present in a kindly way, and at breakfast time made his encampment and retired for the purposes of nature. Stopping his retinue, Kaṭāhaka took water and approached the Bodhisatta. Then the young man fell at the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s feet and cried, &ldquo;Oh, sir, I will pay any sum you may require; but do not expose me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Fear no exposure at my hands,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, pleased at his dutiful conduct, and entered into the city, where he was feted with great magnificence. And Kaṭāhaka still acted as his slave.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2765"></a>As the Treasurer sat at his ease, the border-merchant said: &ldquo;My lord, upon receipt of your letter I duly gave my daughter in marriage to your son.&rdquo; And the Treasurer made a suitable reply about &lsquo;his son&rsquo; in so kindly a way that the merchant was delighted beyond measure. But from that time forth the Bodhisatta could not bear the sight of Kaṭāhaka.</p>
<p class="p7">One day the Great Being sent for the merchant&rsquo;s daughter and said: &ldquo;My dear, please look my head over.&rdquo; She did so, and he thanked her for <a id="a2766"></a><span class="t18">[1.277]</span> her much-needed services, <span class="t18">{1.454}</span> adding, &ldquo;And now tell me, my dear, whether my son is a reasonable man in weal and woe, and whether you manage to get on well with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;My husband has only one fault. He will find fault with his food.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;He has always had his faults, my dear; but I will tell you how to stop his tongue. I will tell you a text which you must learn carefully and repeat to your husband when he finds fault again with his food.&rdquo; And he taught her the lines and shortly afterwards set out for Benares. Kaṭāhaka accompanied him part of the way, and took his leave after offering most valuable presents to the Treasurer. Dating from the departure of the Bodhisatta, Kaṭāhaka waxed prouder and prouder.</p>
<p class="p7">One day his wife ordered a nice dinner, and began to help him to it with a spoon, but at the first mouthful Kaṭāhaka began to grumble. Thereon the merchant&rsquo;s daughter remembering her lesson, repeated the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Bahum-pi so vikattheyya, aññaṁ janapadaṁ gato,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Anvāgantvāna dūseyya: bhuñja bhoge Kaṭāhakā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Should he, having gone to another country, boast excessively, returning back he would spoil it: enjoy your wealth Kaṭāhaka.</span></p>
<p class="p23">&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; thought Kaṭāhaka, &ldquo;the Treasurer must have informed her of my name, and have told her the whole story.&rdquo; And from that day forth he gave himself no more airs, but humbly ate what was set before him, and at his death passed away to fare according to his deeds. <span class="t18">{1.455}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;This bumptious monk was the Kaṭāhaka of those days, and I the Treasurer of Benares.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present, in order to take a bribe, a brahmin pretends he can tell whether swords are lucky or not by sniffing at them. One smith puts pepper on his sword which causes the brahmin to sneeze and cut off his nose. The Buddha tells a story in which a young man sneezed and scared off his enemies and won his bride at the same time, showing that sneezing though unlucky for one, was lucky for another.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the nephew king (bhāgineyyarājā),</span></p>

<p class="p6"><a id="a2774"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Fortune, Relativity, Devas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;In the same way that which is good for one.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a brahmin retained by the king of Kosala because of his power of telling whether swords were lucky or not. We are told that when the king&rsquo;s smiths had forged a sword, this brahmin could by merely smelling it tell whether it was </span><a id="a2775"></a><span class="t18">[1.278]</span><span class="t30"> a lucky one or not. And he made it a rule only to commend the work of those smiths who gave him presents, while he rejected the work of those who did not bribe him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2776"></a><span class="t30">Now a certain smith made a sword and put into the sheath with it some finely-ground pepper, and brought it in this state to the king, who at once handed it over to the brahmin to test. The brahmin unsheathed the blade and sniffed at it. The pepper got up his nose and made him sneeze, and that so violently that he slit his nose on the edge of the sword.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This mishap of the brahmin came to the monk&rsquo;s ears, and one day they were talking about it in the Dhamma Hall when the Teacher entered. On learning the subject of their talk, he said: &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks, that this brahmin has slit his nose sniffing swords. The same fate befell him in former days.&rdquo; So saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, he had in his service a brahmin who professed to tell whether swords were lucky or not, and all came to pass as in the Story of the Present. And the king called in the surgeons and had him fitted with a false tip to his nose which was cunningly painted for all the world like a real nose; and then the brahmin resumed his duties again about the king. Now Brahmadatta had no son, only a daughter and a nephew, whom he had brought up under his own eye. And when these two grew up, they fell in love with one another. So the king sent for his councillors and said to them, &ldquo;My nephew is heir to the throne. If I give him my daughter to wife, he shall be anointed king.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{1.456}</span></p>
<p class="p7">But, on second thoughts, he decided that as in any case his nephew was like a son, he had better marry him to a foreign princess, and give his daughter to a prince of another royal house. For, he thought, this plan would give him more grandchildren and vest in his line the sceptres of two kingdoms. And, after consulting with his councillors, he resolved to separate the two, and they were accordingly made to dwell apart from one another. Now they were sixteen years old and very much in love, and the young prince thought of nothing but how to carry off the princess from her father&rsquo;s palace. At last the plan struck him of sending for a wise woman, to whom he gave a pocketful of money.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s this for?&rdquo; said she. Then he told her of his passion, and besought the wise woman to convey him to his dear princess. And she promised him success, and said that she would tell the king that his daughter was under the influence of witchcraft, but that, as the Yakkha had possessed her so long that he was off his guard, she would take <a id="a2777"></a><span class="t18">[1.279]</span><a id="a2778"></a> the princess one day in a carriage to the cemetery with a strong escort under arms, and there in a magic circle lay the princess on a bed with a dead man under it, and with a hundred and eight douches of scented water wash the Yakkha out of her. &ldquo;And when on this pretext I bring the princess to the cemetery,&rdquo; continued the wise woman, &ldquo;mind that you just reach the cemetery before us in your carriage with an armed escort, taking some ground pepper with you. Arrived at the cemetery, you will leave your carriage at the entrance, and dispatch your men to the cemetery grove, while you will yourself go to the top of the mound and lie down as though dead. Then I will come and set up a bed over you on which I will lay the princess. Then will come the time when you must sniff at the pepper till you sneeze two or three times, and <span class="t18">{1.457}</span> when you sneeze we will leave the princess and take to our heels. Thereon you and the princess must bathe all over, and you must take her home with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Capital,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;a most excellent device.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So away went the wise woman to the king, and he fell in with her idea, as did the princess when it was explained to her. When the day came, the old woman told the princess their errand, and said to the guards on the road in order to frighten them, &ldquo;Listen. Under the bed that I shall set up, there will be a dead man; and that dead man will sneeze. And mark well that, so soon as he has sneezed, he will come out from under the bed and seize on the first person he finds. So be prepared, all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Now the prince had already got to the place and got under the bed as had been arranged. Next the crone led off the princess and laid her upon the bed, whispering to her not to be afraid. At once the prince sniffed at the pepper and fell sneezing. And scarce had he begun to sneeze before the wise woman left the princess and with a loud scream was off, quicker than any of them. Not a man stood his ground; one and all they threw away their arms and bolted for dear life. Hereon the prince came forth and bore off the princess to his home, as had been before arranged. And the old woman made her way to the king and told him what had happened.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought the king, &ldquo;I always intended her for him, and they&rsquo;ve grown up together like ghee in rice-porridge.&rdquo; So he didn&rsquo;t fly into a passion, but in course of time made his nephew king of the land, with his daughter as queen-consort.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the new king kept on in his service the brahmin who professed to tell the temper of swords, and one day as he stood in the sun, the false tip to the brahmin&rsquo;s nose got loose and fell off. And there he stood, hanging his head for very shame. &ldquo;Never mind, never mind,&rdquo; laughed the king. &ldquo;Sneezing is good for some, but bad for others. One sneeze <a id="a2779"></a><span class="t18">[1.280]</span> lost you your nose; <span class="t18">{1.458}</span> while I have to thank a sneeze for both my throne and queen.&rdquo; So saying he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Tathevekassa kalyāṇaṁ, tathevekassa pāpakaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tasmā sabbaṁ na kalyāṇaṁ, sabbaṁ cāpi na pāpakan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">In the same way that which is good for one, is bad for another, so nothing is completely good, and nothing is completely bad.</span></p>
<p class="p23">So spake the king, and after a life spent in generosity and other good works, he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">In this wise did the Teacher teach the lesson that the world was wrong in thinking things were definitely and absolutely good or bad in all cases alike. Lastly, he identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The same man that now professes to understand whether swords are lucky or not, professed the same skill in those days; and I was myself the prince who inherited his uncle&rsquo;s kingdom.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Your district and your property.&rdquo;</span><a id="a2785"></a><a id="a2786"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher once at Jetavana, about a boastful monk. The introductory story and the story of the past in this case are like those of Kaṭāhaka related above [Ja 80].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a certain braggart among the monks. Tradition says that he used to gather round him monks of all ages, and go about deluding everyone with lying boasts about his noble descent. &ldquo;Ah, monks,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no family so noble as mine, no lineage so peerless. I am a scion of the highest of princely lines; no man is my equal in birth or ancestral estate; there is absolutely no end to the gold and silver and other treasures we possess. Our very slaves and menials are fed on rice and meat-stews, and are clad in the best Benares cloth, with the choicest Benares perfumes to perfume themselves withal; while I, because I have joined the Saṅgha, have to content myself with this vile fare and this vile garb.&rdquo; But another monk, after enquiring into his family estate, exposed to the monks the emptiness of this pretension.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So the monks met in the Dhamma Hall, and talk began as to how that monk, in spite of his vows to leave worldly things and cleave only to the dispensation which leads to safety, was going about deluding the monks with his lying boasts. While the fellow&rsquo;s sinfulness was being discussed, the Teacher entered and enquired what their topic was. And they told him. &ldquo;This is not the first time, monks,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;that he has gone about boasting; in bygone days too he went about boasting and deluding people.&rdquo; And so saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2787"></a><a id="a2788"></a><span class="t11">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a rich Treasurer, and his wife bore him a son. And the self-same day a female slave in his house gave birth to a boy, and the two children grew up together. And when the rich man&rsquo;s son was being taught to write, the young slave used to go with his young master&rsquo;s tablets and so learned at the same time to write himself. Next he learned two or three handicrafts, and grew up to be a fair-spoken and handsome young man; and his name was Kalaṇḍuka. Being employed as private secretary, he thought to himself, &ldquo;I shall not always be kept at this work. The slightest fault and I shall be beaten, imprisoned, branded, and fed on slave&rsquo;s fare. On the border there lives a merchant, a friend of my master&rsquo;s. Why should I not go to him with a letter purporting to come from my master, and, passing myself off as my master&rsquo;s son, marry the merchant&rsquo;s daughter and live happily ever afterwards?</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">So he wrote a letter, saying: &ldquo;The bearer of this is my son. It is meet that our houses should be united in marriage, and I would have you give your daughter to this my son and keep the young couple near you for the present. As soon as I can conveniently do so, I will come to you.&rdquo; This letter he sealed with his master&rsquo;s private seal, and came to the border-merchant with a well-filled purse, handsome dresses, and perfumes and the like. And with a bow he stood before the merchant. &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; said the merchant. &ldquo;From Benares.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is your father?&rdquo; &ldquo;The Treasurer of Benares.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what brings you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;This letter will tell you,&rdquo; said Kalaṇḍuka, handing it to him. The merchant read the letter and exclaimed, &ldquo;This gives me new life.&rdquo; And in his joy he gave his daughter to Kalaṇḍuka and set up the young couple, who lived in great style. But Kalaṇḍuka gave himself airs, and used to find fault with the victuals and the clothes that were brought him, calling them &ldquo;provincial.&rdquo; &ldquo;These misguided provincials,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;have no idea of dressing. And as for taste in scents and garlands, they&rsquo;ve got none.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2789"></a>Kalaṇḍuka was in this case the name of the slave of the Treasurer of Benares. And when he had run away and was living in luxury with the daughter of the border-merchant, the Treasurer missed him and could not discover his whereabouts. So he sent a young pet parrot to search for the runaway. And off flew the parrot in quest of Kalaṇḍuka, and searched for him far and wide, till at last the bird came to the town where he dwelt. And just at that very time Kalaṇḍuka was enjoying himself on the river with his wife in a boat well-stocked with dainty fare and with flowers and perfumes. Now the nobles of that land at their water-parties make a point of taking milk with a pungent drug to drink, and so escape suffering from cold after their pastime on the water. <span class="t18">{1.459}</span> But when our Kalaṇḍuka tasted this milk, he hawked and spat it out; and in so doing spat on the head of the merchant&rsquo;s daughter. At this moment up flew the parrot, and saw all this from the bough of a fig tree on the bank. &ldquo;Come, come, <a id="a2790"></a><span class="t18">[1.281]</span><a id="a2791"></a> slave Kalaṇḍuka,&rdquo; cried the bird, &ldquo;remember who and what you are, and don&rsquo;t spit on the head of this young gentlewoman. Know your place, fellow.&rdquo; So saying, he uttered the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Te desā tāni vatthūni ahañ-ca vanagocaro,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Anuvicca kho taṁ gaṇheyyuṁ, piva khīraṁ Kalaṇḍukā ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Your district and your property, whose domain is the woods, I know, after enquiry you will be taken, drink your milk, Kalaṇḍuka.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Recognizing the parrot, Kalaṇḍuka grew afraid of being exposed, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah! Good master, when did you arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Thought the parrot, &ldquo;It is not friendliness, but a wish to wring my neck, that prompts this kindly interest.&rdquo; So he replied that he did not stand in need of Kalaṇḍuka&rsquo;s services, and flew off to Benares, where he told the Lord Treasurer everything he had seen.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;The rascal!&rdquo; cried the Treasurer, and ordered Kalaṇḍuka to be hauled back to Benares where he had once more to put up with a slave&rsquo;s fare.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;This monk was Kalaṇḍuka in the story, and I the Treasurer of Benares.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;He who raises the flag of Dhamma.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {1.460}</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about a deceitful person. When the monk&rsquo;s deceit was reported to him, the Teacher said: &ldquo;This is not the first time he has shown himself a deceitful person; he was just the same in times gone by.&rdquo; So saying he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a rat, perfect in wisdom, and as big as a young boar. He had his dwelling in the forest and many hundreds of other rats owned his sway.<a id="a2800"></a><span class="t18"> [1.282]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now there was a roving jackal who espied this troop of rats and fell to scheming how to beguile and eat them. And he took up his stand near their home with his face to the sun, snuffing up the wind, and standing on one leg. Seeing this when out on his road in quest of food, the Bodhisatta conceived the jackal to be a saintly being, and went up and asked his name.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2801"></a>&ldquo;Dhammika [Righteous] is my name,&rdquo; said the jackal. &ldquo;Why do you stand only on one leg?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because if I stood on all four at once, the earth could not bear my weight. That is why I stand on one leg only.&rdquo; &ldquo;And why do you keep your mouth open?&rdquo; &ldquo;To eat the air. I live on air; it is my only food.&rdquo; &ldquo;And why do you face the sun?&rdquo; &ldquo;To worship him.&rdquo; &ldquo;What uprightness!&rdquo; thought the Bodhisatta, and thenceforward he made a point of going, attended by the other rats, to pay his respects morning and evening to the saintly jackal. And when the rats were leaving, the jackal seized and devoured the hindermost one of them, wiped his lips, and looked as though nothing had happened. In consequence of this the rats grew fewer and fewer, till they noticed the gaps in their ranks, and wondering why this was so, asked the Bodhisatta the reason. He could not make it out, but suspecting the jackal, <span class="t18">{1.461}</span> resolved to put him to the test. So next day he let the other rats go out first and himself brought up the rear. The jackal made a spring on the Bodhisatta who, seeing him coming, faced round and cried, &ldquo;So this is your saintliness, you deceitful person and rascal!&rdquo; And he repeated the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a2802"></a><a id="a2803"></a><a id="a2804"></a><span class="t12">1. Yo ve Dhammaṁ dhajaṁ katvā, nigūḷho pāpam-ācare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a2805"></a><a id="a2806"></a><a id="a2807"></a><span class="t12">Vissāsayitvā bhūtāni, biḷāraṁ nāma taṁ vatan-ti.</span></p>

<p class="p23">So saying, the king of the rats sprang at the jackal&rsquo;s throat and bit his windpipe asunder just under the jaw, so that he died. Back trooped the other rats and gobbled up the body of the jackal with a &lsquo;crunch, crunch, crunch;&rsquo; that is to say, the foremost of them did, for they say there was none left for the last-comers. And ever after the rats lived happily in peace and quiet.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher made the connection by saying: &ldquo;This hypocritical monk was the jackal of those days, and I the king of the rats.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was king of the rats and dwelt in the forest. Now a fire broke out in the forest, and a jackal who could not run away put his head against a tree <span class="t18">{1.462}</span><a id="a2819"></a> and let the flames sweep by him. The fire singed the hair off his body everywhere, and left him perfectly bald, except for a tuft like a scalp-knot<a id="a2820"></a><a href="notes.html#a14941"><span class="t9">{345}</span></a> where the crown of his head was pressed against the tree. Drinking one day in a rocky pool, he caught sight of this top-knot reflected in the water. &ldquo;At last I&rsquo;ve got wherewithal to go to market,&rdquo; thought he. Coming in the course of his wanderings in the forest to the rats&rsquo; cave, he said to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hoodwink those rats and devour them,&rdquo; and with this intent he took up his stand nearby, just as in the foregoing story.</p>
<p class="p7">On his way out in quest of food, the Bodhisatta observed the jackal and, crediting the beast with virtue and goodness, came to him and asked what his name was.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2821"></a>&ldquo;Bhāradvāja, Votary of the Fire-God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why have you come here?&rdquo; &ldquo;In order to guard you and yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;What will you do to guard us?&rdquo; &ldquo;I know how to count on my fingers, and will count your numbers both morning and evening, so as to be sure that as many came home at night, as went out in the morning. That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ll guard you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then stay, uncle, and watch over us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">And accordingly, as the rats were starting in the morning he set about counting them, &ldquo;One, two, three,&rdquo; and so again when they came back at night. And every time he counted them, he seized and ate the hindmost. Everything came to pass as in the foregoing story, except that here the king of the rats turned and said to the jackal, &ldquo;It is not sanctity, <a id="a2822"></a><span class="t18">[1.284]</span> Bhāradvāja, Votary of the Fire-God, but gluttony that has decked your crown with that top-knot.&rdquo; So saying, he uttered this verse:</p>

She is said to have been the wicked wife of a good and virtuous brahmin, who was a lay brother. Her nights she spent in gadding about; while by day she did not a stroke of work, but made out to be ill and lay in bed groaning.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;What is the matter with you, my dear?&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;Wind troubles me.&rdquo; &ldquo;What can I get for you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sweets, savouries, rich food, rice-gruel, boiled-rice, oil, and so forth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The obedient husband did as she wished, and toiled like a slave for her. She meantime kept her bed while her husband was about the house; but no sooner saw the door shut on him, than she was in the arms of her lovers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;My poor wife doesn&rsquo;t seem to get any better of the wind,&rdquo; thought the brahmin at last, and betook himself with offerings of perfumes, flowers, and the like, to the Teacher at Jetavana. His obeisance done, he stood before the Fortunate One, who asked him why he had been absent so long.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the brahmin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told my wife is troubled with the wind, and I toil away to keep her supplied with every conceivable dainty. And now she is stout and her complexion quite clear, but the wind is as troublesome as ever. It is through ministering to my wife that I have not had any time to come here, sir.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Said the Teacher, who knew the wife&rsquo;s wickedness, &ldquo;Ah! Brahmin, the wise and good of days gone by taught you how to treat a woman suffering like your wife from so stubborn an ailment. But rebirth has confused your memory so that you forget.&rdquo; So saying, he told the following story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a brahmin in a very distinguished family. After perfecting <a id="a2838"></a><span class="t18">[1.285]</span> his education at Taxila, he became a teacher of world-wide fame in Benares. To him flocked as pupils the young nobles and brahmins from all the princely and wealthy families. Now a country brahmin, who had learned from the Bodhisatta the three Vedas, and the eighteen Sciences, and who stopped on in Benares to look after his estate, came two or three times every day to listen to the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s teachings. <span class="t18">{1.464}</span> And this brahmin had a wife who was a bad, wicked woman. And everything came to pass as above.</p>
<p class="p7">When the brahmin explained how it was that he could not get away to listen to his master&rsquo;s teachings, the Bodhisatta, who knew that the brahmin&rsquo;s wife was only feigning sickness, thought to himself, &ldquo;I will tell him what treatment will cure the creature.&rdquo; So he said to the brahmin, &ldquo;Get her no more dainties, my son, but collect the urinations of cows and therein souse five kinds of fruit and so forth, and let the lot pickle in a new copper pot till the whole savours of the metal. Then take a rope or cord or stick and go to your wife, and tell her plainly she must either swallow the cure you have brought her, or else work for her food. (And here you will repeat certain lines which I will tell you.) If she refuses the remedy, then threaten to let her have a taste of the rope or stick, and to drag her about for a time by the hair, while you pummel her with your fists. You will find that at the mere threat she will be up and about her work.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So off went the brahmin and brought his wife a mess prepared as the Bodhisatta had directed. &ldquo;Who prescribed this?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The master,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;Take it away, I won&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t have it, eh?&rdquo; said the young brahmin, taking up the rope-end, &ldquo;well then, you&rsquo;ve either got to swallow down that cure or else to work for honest fare.&rdquo; So saying he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Yathā vācā ca bhuñjassu, yathā bhuttañ-ca byāhara,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ubhayaṁ te na sameti vācā bhuttañ-ca, Kosiye ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Accordingly, you can enjoy your words, and you can speak of food, however, you cannot have both the words and the food, Kosiyā. </span><span class="t18">{1.465}</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Because of not sharing with anyone.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [1.286]</span><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta. For at that time the monks were discussing in the Dhamma Hall the ingratitude of Devadatta and his inability to recognise the Teacher&rsquo;s goodness, when the Teacher himself entered and on enquiry was told the subject of their talk. &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is not the first time that Devadatta has been ungrateful to the Tathāgata; he was just as ungrateful in bygone days.&rdquo; So saying, he told this story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{1.466}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2851"></a><a id="a2852"></a>In the past, when a certain king of Magadha was reigning in Rājagaha, the Bodhisatta was his Treasurer, worth eighty crores, and known as the wealthy man Saṅkha (Saṅkhaseṭṭhi). In Benares there dwelt a Treasurer also worth eighty crores, who was named Piliya, and was a great friend of Saṅkha. For some reason or other Piliya of Benares got into difficulties, and lost all his property, and was reduced to beggary. In his need he left Benares, and with his wife journeyed on foot to Rājagaha, to see Saṅkha, the last hope left him. And Saṅkha embraced his friend and treated him as an honoured guest, asking, in due course, the reason of the visit. &ldquo;I am a ruined man,&rdquo; answered Piliya, &ldquo;I have lost everything, and have come to ask you to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;With all my heart! Have no fear on that score,&rdquo; said Saṅkha. He had his strong-room opened, and gave to Piliya forty crores. Also he divided into two equal parts the whole of his property, livestock and all, and bestowed on Piliya half of his entire fortune. Taking his wealth, Piliya went back to Benares, and there dwelt.</p>
<p class="p7">Not long after a like calamity overtook Saṅkha, who, in his turn, lost every penny he had. Casting about whither to turn in the hour of need, he bethought him how he had befriended Piliya to half of his possessions, and might go to him for assistance without fear of being thrown out. So he set out from Rājagaha with his wife, and came to Benares. At the entrance to the city he said to her, &ldquo;Wife, it is not befitting for you to trudge along the streets with me. Wait here a little till I send a carriage with a servant to bring you into the city in proper state.&rdquo; So saying, he left her under shelter, and went on alone into the town, till he came to Piliya&rsquo;s house, where he bade himself be announced as Saṅkha from Rājagaha, come to see his friend.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Well, show him in,&rdquo; said Piliya; but at sight of the other&rsquo;s condition he neither rose to meet him, nor greeted him with words of welcome, but only demanded what brought him here.<a id="a2853"></a><span class="t18"> [1.287]</span> &ldquo;To see you,&rdquo; was the reply. <span class="t18">{1.467}</span> &ldquo;Where are you stopping?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nowhere, as yet. I left my wife under shelter and came straight to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2854"></a>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no room here for you. Take a dole of rice, find somewhere to cook and eat it, and then begone and never come to visit me again.&rdquo; So saying, the rich man dispatched a servant with orders to give his unfortunate friend half a measure of bran to carry away tied up in the corner of his cloth; and this, though that very day he had had a thousand wagon-loads of the best rice threshed out and stored up in his overflowing granaries. Yes, the rascal, who had coolly taken four hundred millions, now doled out half a measure of bran to his benefactor!</p>
<p class="p7">Accordingly, the servant measured out the bran in a basket, and brought it to the Bodhisatta, who argued within himself whether or no he should take it. And he thought: &ldquo;This ingrate breaks off our friendship because I am a ruined man. Now, if I refuse his paltry gift, I shall be as bad as he. For the ignoble, who scorn a modest gift, outrage the first idea of friendship. Be it, therefore, mine to fulfil friendship so far as in me lies, by taking his gift of bran.&rdquo; So he tied up the bran in the corner of his cloth, and made his way back to where he had housed his wife.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What have you got, dear?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Our friend Piliya gives us this bran, and washes his hands of us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, why did you take it? Is this a fit return for the forty crores?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, dear wife,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;I took it simply because I wanted not to violate the principle of friendship. Why these tears?&rdquo; So saying, he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Asampadānen&rsquo; itarītarassa,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bālassa mittāni kalībhavanti,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tasmā harāmi bhusaṁ aḍḍhamānaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mā me mitti jīyittha sassatāyan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Because of not sharing with anyone, to a fool, friends are a source of distress, </span><span class="t18">{1.468} </span><span class="t4">so I accept his half-measure of chaff, do not let me be deprived of his friendship forever.</span></p>
<p class="p23">But still the wife kept on crying.</p>
<p class="p7">Now, at that moment a farm-servant whom Saṅkha had given to Piliya was passing by and drew near on hearing the weeping of his former mistress. Recognising his master and mistress, he fell at their feet, and with tears and sobs asked the reason of their coming. And the Bodhisatta told him their story.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Keep up your spirits,&rdquo; said the man, cheerily; and, taking them to his own dwelling, there made ready perfumed baths, and a meal for them. Then he let the other slaves know that their old master and mistress had come, and after a few days marched them in a body to the king&rsquo;s palace, where they made quite a commotion.</p>
<p class="p7">The king asked what the matter was, and they told him the whole <a id="a2855"></a><span class="t18">[1.288]</span> story. So he sent forthwith for the two, and asked Saṅkha whether the report was true that he had given four hundred millions to Piliya.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when in his need my friend confided in me, and came to seek my aid, I gave him the half, not only of my money, but of my livestock and of everything that I possessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Is this so?&rdquo; said the king to Piliya. &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And when, in his turn, your benefactor confided in you and sought you out, did you show him honour and hospitality?&rdquo; Here Piliya was silent. &ldquo;Did you have a half-quartern of bran doled out into the corner of his cloth?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{1.469} </span>Still Piliya was silent.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king took counsel with his ministers as to what should be done, and finally, as a judgment on Piliya, ordered them to go to Piliya&rsquo;s house and give the whole of Piliya&rsquo;s wealth to Saṅkha.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Nay, sire,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;I need not what is another&rsquo;s. Let me be given nothing beyond what I formerly gave him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king ordered that the Bodhisatta should enjoy his own again; and the Bodhisatta, with a large retinue of servants, came back with his regained wealth to Rājagaha, where he put his affairs in order, and after a life spent in generosity and other good works, passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;Devadatta was the Treasurer Piliya of those days, and I myself Saṅkha.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Skilful advice, with firm resolution.&rdquo;</span><a id="a2862"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana about the Sutta concerning the Temptation by the Daughters of Māra</span><a id="a2863"></a><a href="notes.html#a14943"><span class="t9">{346}</span></a><span class="t30"> at the Goatherds&rsquo; Banyan tree. The Teacher quoted the Sutta, beginning with its opening words:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&ldquo;In all their dazzling beauty on they came,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Craving and Hate and Lust. Like cotton-down</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Before the wind, the Teacher made them fly.&rdquo; </span><a id="a2864"></a><span class="t18">[1.289]</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a2865"></a><span class="t30">After he had recited the Sutta right through to the end, the monks met together in the Dhamma Hall and spoke of how the Daughters of Māra drew near in all their myriad charms yet failed to seduce the Fully Awakened One. For he did not as much as open his eyes to look upon them, so marvellous was he! Entering the hall, the Teacher asked, and was told, what they were discussing. &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is no marvel that I did not so much as look upon the Daughters of Māra in this life when I have put wrong from me and have won Awakening. In former days when I was but in quest of Awakening, when wronging still dwelt within me, I found strength not to gaze even upon loveliness divine by way of lust in violation of virtue; and by that continence I won a kingdom.&rdquo; So saying, he told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was the youngest of a hundred brothers, and his adventures are to be detailed here, as above <span class="t18">{1.470}</span><a id="a2866"></a><a id="a2867"></a> in the Takkasilajātaka [Ja 96].<a id="a2868"></a><a href="notes.html#a14945"><span class="t9">{347}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now in those days there were Paccekabuddhas who used to come to take their meals at the palace, and the Bodhisatta ministered to them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2869"></a><span class="t11">Thinking one day of the great number of brothers he had, the Bodhisatta asked himself whether there was any likelihood of his coming to the his father&rsquo;s throne in that city, and determined to ask the Paccekabuddhas to tell him what should come to pass. Next day the Buddhas came, took the waterpot that was consecrated to holy uses, filtered the water, washed and dried their feet, and sat down to their meal. And as they sat, the Bodhisatta came and seating himself by them with a courteous salutation, put his question. And they answered and said: &ldquo;Prince, you will never come to be king in this city. But in Gandhāra, two thousand leagues away, there stands the city of Taxila. If you can reach that city, in seven days you will become king there. But there is peril on the road there, in journeying through a great forest. It is double the distance round the forest than it is to pass through it. Amanussas have their dwelling therein, and Yakkhinis make villages and houses arise by the wayside. Beneath a goodly canopy embroidered with stars overhead, their magic sets a costly couch shut in by fair curtains of wondrous dye. Arranged in celestial splendour the Yakkhinis sit within their abodes, seducing wayfarers with honied words. &lsquo;Weary you seem,&rsquo; they say; &lsquo;come here, and eat and drink before you journey further on your way.&rsquo; Those that come at their bidding are given seats and fired to lust by the charm of their wanton beauty. But scarce have they sinned, before the Yakkhinis slay them and eat them while the warm blood is still flowing. And they ensnare men&rsquo;s senses; captivating the sense of beauty with utter loveliness, the ear with sweet minstrelsy, the nostrils with heavenly odours, the taste with heavenly dainties of exquisite savour, and the touch with red-cushioned couches divinely soft. But if you can subdue your senses, and be strong in your resolve not to look upon them, then on the seventh day you will become king of the city of Taxila.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Oh, sirs; how could I look upon the Yakkhinis after your advice to me?&rdquo; So saying, the Bodhisatta besought the Paccekabuddhas to give him something to keep him safe on his journey. Receiving from them a charmed thread and some charmed sand, he first bade farewell to the Paccekabuddhas and to his father and mother; and then, going to his own abode, he addressed his household as follows, &ldquo;I am going to Taxila to make myself king there. You will stop behind here.&rdquo; But five of them answered, &ldquo;Let us go too.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;You may not come with me,&rdquo; answered the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;for I am told that the way is beset by Yakkhinis who captivate men&rsquo;s senses, and destroy those who succumb to their charms. Great is the danger, but I will rely on myself and go.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;If we go with you, prince, we should not gaze upon their baleful charms. We too will go to Taxila.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then show yourselves steadfast,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, and took those five with him on his journey.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The Yakkhinis sat waiting by the way in their villages. And one of the five, the lover of beauty, looked upon the Yakkhinis, and being ensnared by their beauty, lagged behind the rest. &ldquo;Why are you dropping behind?&rdquo; asked the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;My feet hurt me, prince. I&rsquo;ll just sit down for a bit in one of these pavilions, and then catch you up.&rdquo; &ldquo;My good man, these are Yakkhinis; don&rsquo;t hanker after them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be that as it may, prince, I can&rsquo;t go any further.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you will soon be shown in your real colours,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, as he went on with the other four.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Yielding to his senses, the lover of beauty drew near to the Yakkhinis, who tempted him to wrong, and killed him then and there. Thereon they departed, and further along the road raised by magic arts a new pavilion, in which they sat singing to the music of divers instruments. And now the lover of music dropped behind and was eaten. Then the Yakkhinis went on further and sat waiting in a bazaar stocked with all sweet scents and perfumes. And here the lover of sweet-smelling things fell behind. And when they had eaten him, they went on further and sat in a provision-booth where a profusion of heavenly viands of exquisite savour was offered for sale. And here the gourmet fell behind. And when they had eaten him, they went on further, and sat on heavenly couches wrought by their magic arts. And here the lover of comfort fell behind. And him too they ate.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Only the Bodhisatta was left now. And one of the Yakkhinis followed him, promising herself that for all his stern resolution she would succeed in devouring him before she turned back. Further on in the forest, woodmen and others, seeing the Yakkhini, asked her who the man was that walked on ahead.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;He is my husband, good gentlemen.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Hi, there!&rdquo; said they to the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;when you have got a sweet young wife, fair as the flowers, to leave her home and put her trust in you, why don&rsquo;t you walk with her instead of letting her trudge wearily behind you?&rdquo; &ldquo;She is no wife of mine, but a Yakkhini. She has eaten my five companions.&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas, good gentlemen,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;anger will drive men to say their very wives are Yakkhinis and Petas.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2870"></a><span class="t11">Next, she simulated pregnancy and then the look of a woman who has borne one child; and child on hip, she followed after the Bodhisatta. Everyone they met asked just the same questions about the pair, and the Bodhisatta gave just the same answer as he journeyed on.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">At last he came to Taxila, where the Yakkhini made the child disappear, and followed alone. At the gates of the city the Bodhisatta entered a rest house and sat down. Because of the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s efficacy and power, she could not enter too; so she arrayed herself in divine beauty and stood on the threshold.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The king of Taxila was at that moment passing by on his way to his pleasure gardens, and was snared by her loveliness. &ldquo;Go, find out,&rdquo; said he to an attendant, &ldquo;whether she has a husband with her or not.&rdquo; And when the messenger came and asked whether she had a husband with her, she said: &ldquo;Yes, sir; my husband is sitting within in the chamber.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;She is no wife of mine,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;She is a Yakkhini and has eaten my five companions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">And, as before, she said: &ldquo;Alas, good gentlemen, anger will drive men to say anything that comes into their heads.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Then the man went back to the king and told him what each had said. &ldquo;Treasure-trove is a royal perquisite,&rdquo; said the king. And he sent for the Yakkhini and had her seated on the back of his elephant. After a solemn procession round the city, the king came back to his palace and had the Yakkhini lodged in the apartments reserved for a queen-consort. After bathing and perfuming himself, the king ate his evening meal and then lay down on his royal bed. The Yakkhini too prepared herself a meal, and donned all her splendour. And as she lay by the side of the delighted king, she turned on to her side and burst into tears. Being asked why she wept, she said: &ldquo;Sire, you found me by the wayside, and the women of the harem are many. Dwelling here among enemies I shall feel crushed when they say &lsquo;Who knows who your father and mother are, or anything about your family? You were picked up by the wayside.&rsquo; But if your majesty would give me power and authority over the whole kingdom, nobody would dare to annoy me with such taunts.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Sweetheart, I have no power over those that dwell throughout my kingdom; I am not their lord and master. I have only jurisdiction over those who revolt or do iniquity. So I cannot give you power and authority over the whole kingdom.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Then, sire, if you cannot give me authority over the kingdom or over the city, at least give me authority within the palace, that I may have rule here over those that dwell in the palace.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Too deeply smitten with her charms to refuse, the king gave her authority over all within the palace and bade her have rule over them. Contented, she waited till the king was asleep, and then making her way to the city of the Yakkhas returned with the whole crew of Yakkhas to the palace. And she herself slew the king and devoured him, skin, tendons and flesh, leaving only the bare bones. And the rest of the Yakkhas entering the gate devoured everything as it came in their way, not leaving even a fowl or a dog alive. Next day when people came and found the gate shut, they beat on it with impatient cries, and effected an entrance &ndash; only to find the whole palace strewn with bones. And they exclaimed, &ldquo;So the man was right in saying she was not his wife but a Yakkhini. In his unwisdom the king brought her home to be his wife, and doubtless she has assembled the other Yakkhas, devoured everybody, and then made off.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now on that day the Bodhisatta, with the charmed sand on his head and the charmed thread twisted round his brow, was standing in the rest house, sword in hand, waiting for the dawn. Those others, meantime, cleansed the palace, garnished the floors afresh, sprinkled perfumes on them, scattered flowers, hanging nosegays from the roof and festooning the walls with garlands, and burning incense in the place. Then they took counsel together, as follows:</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;The man that could so master his senses as not so much as to look at the Yakkhini as she followed him in her divine beauty, is a noble and steadfast man, filled with wisdom. With such a one as king, it would be well with the whole kingdom. Let us make him our king.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">And all the courtiers and all the citizens of the kingdom were one-minded in the matter. So the Bodhisatta, being chosen king, was escorted into the capital and there decked in jewels and anointed king of Taxila.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2871"></a>When the kingdom had been offered to the Bodhisatta by the people, and when he had accepted it and been anointed king, the people decorated the town like a city of the gods and the royal palace like the palace of Sakka. Entering the city the Bodhisatta passed into the spacious hall of the palace and there seated himself in all his godlike beauty on his jewelled throne beneath the white umbrella of his kingship. Round him in glittering splendour stood his ministers and brahmins and nobles, while sixteen thousand dancing girls, fair as the Devaccharā<a id="a2872"></a>, sang and danced and made music, till the palace was loud with sounds like the ocean when the storm bursts in thunder on its waters.<a id="a2873"></a><a href="notes.html#a14948"><span class="t9">{348}</span></a><a id="a2874"></a> Gazing round on the pomp of his royal state, the Bodhisatta thought how, had he looked upon the charms of the Yakkhinis, he would have perished miserably, nor ever have lived to see his present magnificence, which he owed to his following the counsels of the Paccekabuddhas. And as these thoughts filled his heart, his uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a2875"></a><a id="a2876"></a><a id="a2877"></a><a id="a2878"></a><span class="t12">1. Kusalūpadese dhitiyā daḷhāya ca,</span></p>

<p class="p23">So ended the lesson which these verses taught. And the Great Being ruled his kingdom in righteousness, and abounded in generosity and other good works till in the end he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;I was the prince of those days who went to Taxila and won a kingdom.&rdquo;</span></p>

Here he hoped to pass the rainy season, but during the very first month his hut was burnt down while he was in the village seeking alms. Feeling the loss of its sheltering roof, he told his lay friends of his misfortune, and they readily undertook to build him another hut. But, in spite of their protestations, three months slipped away without its being rebuilt. Having no roof to shelter him, the monk had no success in his meditation. Not even the mental image had been vouchsafed to him when at the close of the rainy season he went back to Jetavana and stood respectfully before the Teacher. In the course of talk the Teacher asked whether the monk&rsquo;s meditation had been successful. Then that monk related from the beginning the good and ill that had befallen him. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;In days gone by, even brute beasts could discern between what was good and what bad for them and so quit betimes, ere they proved dangerous, the habitations that had sheltered them in happier days. And if beasts were so discerning, how could you fall so far short of them in wisdom?&rdquo; So saying, at that monk&rsquo;s request, the Teacher told this story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a bird. When he came to years of discretion, good fortune attended him and he became king of the birds, taking up his abode with his subjects in a giant tree which stretched its leafy branches over the waters of a lake. And all these birds, <span class="t18">{1.472}</span> roosting in the boughs, dropped their dung into the waters below. Now that lake was the abode of Caṇḍa, the Nāga king, who was enraged by this fouling of his water and resolved to take vengeance on the birds and burn them out. So one night when they were all roosting along the branches, he set to work, and first he made the waters of the lake to boil, then he caused smoke to arise, and thirdly he made flames dart up as high as a palm tree.</p>
<p class="p7">Seeing the flames shooting up from the water, the Bodhisatta cried to the birds, &ldquo;Water is used to quench fire; but here is the water itself on fire. This is no place for us; let us seek a home elsewhere.&rdquo; So saying, he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Khemaṁ yahiṁ tattha arī udīrito,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dakassa majjhe jalate ghatāsano,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Na ajja vāso mahiyā mahīruhe,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Disā bhajavho saraṇājja no bhayan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Where there is safety there are foes, is said, fire burns in the middle of the water. Not living today in this tree on earth, go away, there is danger from our refuge today. </span><a id="a2897"></a><span class="t18">[1.291]</span></p>
<p class="p23">And hereupon the Bodhisatta flew off with such of the birds as followed his advice; but the disobedient birds, who stopped behind, all perished.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof that monk became an Arahat, and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;The loyal and obedient birds of those days are now become my disciples, and I myself was then the king of the birds.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Those who are conscious.&rdquo;</span><a id="a2909"></a><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{1.473}</span><a id="a2910"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Teacher while at Jetavana, about the interpretation by Sāriputta, Captain of the Dhamma, at the gate of Saṅkassa town, of a problem tersely propounded by the Teacher.</span><a id="a2911"></a><a href="notes.html#a14950"><span class="t9">{349}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At that time the Teacher put a question concisely to that elder. This is the full story, put briefly, of the descent from the world of gods. When the venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja had by his Supernormal Powers gained the sandalwood bowl in the presence of the great merchant of Rājagaha, the Teacher forbade the monks to use their miraculous Supernormal Powers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then the schismatics thought: &ldquo;The ascetic Gotama has forbidden the use of miraculous Supernormal Powers: now he will do no miracle himself.&rdquo; Their disciples were disturbed, and said to the schismatics, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you take the bowl by your Supernormal Powers?&rdquo; They replied, &ldquo;This is no hard thing for us, friend. But we think, &lsquo;Who will display before the laity his own fine and subtle powers for the sake of a paltry wooden bowl?&rsquo; and so we did not take it. The ascetics of the Sakya class took it, and showed their Supernormal Powers for sheer foolish greed. Do not imagine it is any trouble to us to work miracles. Suppose we leave out of consideration the disciples of Gotama the ascetic: if we like, we too will show our Supernormal Powers with the ascetic Gotama himself: if the ascetic Gotama works one miracle, we will work one twice as good.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The monks who heard this told the Fortunate One of it, &ldquo;Sir, the schismatics say they will work a miracle.&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Let them do it, monks; I will do the like.&rdquo; Bimbisāra, hearing this, went and asked the Fortunate One, &ldquo;Will you work a miracle, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, O king.&rdquo; &ldquo;Was there not a command given on this matter, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;The command, O king, was given to my disciples; there is no command which can rule the Buddhas. When the flowers and fruit in your park are forbidden to others, the same rule does not apply to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then where will you work this miracle, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;At Sāvatthi, under Gaṇḍa&rsquo;s mango tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;What have I to do, then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nothing, sire.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Next day, after breaking his fast, the Teacher went to seek alms. &ldquo;Whither goes the Teacher?&rdquo; asked the people. The monks answered to them, &ldquo;At the gate of the city of Sāvatthi, beneath Gaṇḍa&rsquo;s mango tree, he is to work a twofold miracle to the confounding of the schismatics.&rdquo; The crowd said: &ldquo;This miracle will be what they call a masterpiece; we will go see it,&rdquo; leaving the doors of their houses, they went along with the Teacher. Some of the schismatics also followed the Teacher, with their disciples, &ldquo;We too,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;will work a miracle, in the place where the ascetic Gotama shall work his.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">By and by the Teacher arrived at Sāvatthi. The king asked him, &ldquo;Is it true, sir, you are about to work a miracle, as they say?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it is true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;On the seventh day from now, at the full moon of the month of July.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shall I set up a pavilion, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Peace, great king: in the place where I shall work my miracle Sakka will set up a pavilion of jewels twelve leagues in compass.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shall I proclaim this thing through the city, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Proclaim it, O king.&rdquo; The king sent forth the announcer of the Dhamma on an elephant richly caparisoned, to proclaim thus, &ldquo;News! The Teacher is about to perform a miracle, for the confounding of the schismatics, at the Gate of Sāvatthi, under Gaṇḍa&rsquo;s mango tree, seven days from now!&rdquo; Each day was this proclamation made. When the schismatics heard this news, that the miracle will be done under Gaṇḍa&rsquo;s mango tree, they had all the mango trees near to Sāvatthi cut down, paying the owners for them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">On the night of the full moon the announcer of the Dhamma made proclamation, &ldquo;This day in the morning the miracle will take place.&rdquo; By the power of the gods it was as though all Jambudīpa was at the door and heard the proclamation; whosoever had it in his heart to go, they all betook themselves to Sāvatthi: for twelve leagues the crowd extended.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Early in the morning the Teacher went on his rounds seeking alms. The king&rsquo;s gardener, Gaṇḍa by name, was just taking to the king a fine ripe mango fruit; thoroughly ripe, big as a bushel, when he espied the Teacher at the city gate. &ldquo;This fruit is worthy of the Tathāgata,&rdquo; said he, and gave it to him. The Teacher took it, and sitting down then and there on one side, ate the fruit. When it was eaten, he said: &ldquo;Ānanda, give the gardener this stone to plant here on the spot; this shall be Gaṇḍa&rsquo;s mango tree.&rdquo; The elder did so.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The gardener dug a hole in the earth, and planted it. On the</span><span class="t35"> </span><span class="t34">instant the stone burst, roots sprouted forth, up sprang a red shoot tall as a plough-pole; even as the crowd stared it grew into a mango tree of a hundred cubits, with a trunk fifty cubits and branches of fifty cubits in height; at the same time flowers bloomed, fruit ripened; the tree stood filling the sky, covered with bees, laden with golden fruit; when the wind blew on it, sweet fruits fell; then the monks came up and ate of the fruit, and retired.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">In the evening time the King of the Devas, reflecting, perceived that it was a task laid on him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things. So he sent the Devaputta Vissakamma, and caused him to make a pavilion of the seven precious things, twelve leagues in compass, covered all over with blue lotus. Thus the gods of ten thousand spheres were gathered together. The Teacher, for the confounding of the schismatics having performed a twofold miracle passing marvellous among his disciples, caused faith to spring up in multitudes, then arose and, sitting in the Buddha&rsquo;s seat, declared the Dhamma. Twenty crores of beings drank of the waters of life. Then, meditating to see whither it was that former Buddhas went when they had done a miracle, and perceiving that it was to the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, up he rose from the Buddha&rsquo;s seat, the right foot he placed on the top of Mount Yugandhara, and with his left strode to the peak of Sineru, he began the Rains Retreat under the great Coral Tree, seated upon the yellow-stone throne; for the space of three months he discoursed upon the Abhidhamma to the gods.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The people knew not the place whither the Teacher had gone; they looked, and said: &ldquo;Let us go home,&rdquo; and lived in that place during the rainy season. When the rainy season was near to its end, and the feast was at hand, the great elder Moggallāna went and announced it to the Fortunate One. Thereupon the Teacher asked him, &ldquo;Where is Sāriputta now?&rdquo; &ldquo;He, sir, after the miracle which delighted him, remained with five hundred monks in the city of Saṅkassa, and is there still.&rdquo; &ldquo;Moggallāna, on the seventh day from now I shall descend by the gate of Saṅkassa. Let those who desire to behold the Tathāgata assemble in the city of Saṅkassa.&rdquo; The elder assented, went and told the people: the whole company he transported from Sāvatthi to Saṅkassa, a distance of thirty leagues, in the twinkling of an eye.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Rains Retreat over, and the Invitation celebrated, the Teacher told king Sakka that he was about to return to the world of men. Then Sakka sent for Vissakamma, and said to him, &ldquo;Make a stairway for the One with Ten Powers to descend into the world of men.&rdquo; He placed the head of the stairway upon the peak of Sineru, and the foot of it by the gate of Saṅkassa, and between he made three stairways side by side: one of gems, one of silver, and one of gold: the balustrade and cornice were of the seven things of price. The Teacher, having performed a miracle for the world&rsquo;s emancipation, descended by the midmost stair made out of gems. Sakka carried the bowl and robe, Suyāma a yak&rsquo;s-tail fan, Brahmā Lord of all beings bore a sunshade, and the deities of the ten thousand spheres worshipped with divine garlands and perfumes. When the Teacher stood at the foot of the staircase, first elder Sāriputta gave him greeting, afterwards the rest of the company.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Amidst this assembly the Teacher thought: &ldquo;Moggallāna has been shown to possess supernatural power, Upāli as one who is versed in the sacred law, but the quality of high wisdom possessed by Sāriputta has not been shown. Save and except me, no other possesses wisdom so full and complete as his; I will make known the quality of his wisdom.&rdquo; First of all he asked a question which is put to ordinary persons, and the ordinary persons answered it. Then he asked a question within the scope of those of the First Path, and this they of the First Path answered, but the ordinary folk knew nought of it. In the same way he asked questions in turn within the scope of those of the Second and Third Paths, of the Arahats, of the chief disciples; and in each case those who were below each grade in turn were unable to answer, but they who were above could answer. Then he put a question within the power of Sāriputta, and this the elder could answer, but the others not so. The people asked, &ldquo;Who is this elder who answered the Teacher?&rdquo; They were told, it was the Captain of the Dhamma, and Sāriputta was his name. &ldquo;Ah, great is his wisdom!&rdquo; they said. Ever afterwards the quality of the elder&rsquo;s great wisdom was known to men and to gods. Then the Teacher said to him,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">&ldquo;Some have probations yet to pass, and some have reached the goal:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">Their different behaviours say, for you do know the whole.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t34">Having thus asked a question which comes within a Buddha&rsquo;s scope, he added, &ldquo;Here is a point put with brevity, Sāriputta; what is the meaning of the matter in all its bearings?&rdquo; The elder considered the problem. He thought: &ldquo;The Teacher asks of the proper behaviour with which the monks attain progress, both those who are in the lower Paths and those who are Arahats?&rdquo; As to the general question, he had no doubt. But then he considered, &ldquo;The proper manner of behaviour may be described in many ways of speaking according to the essential elements of being, and so forth from that beginning; now in what fashion can I hit the Teacher&rsquo;s meaning?&rdquo; He was doubtful about the meaning. The Teacher thought: &ldquo;Sāriputta has no doubt of the general question, but doubts what particular side of it I have in view. If I give no clue, he will never be able to answer, so a clue I will give him.&rdquo; This clue he gave by saying: &ldquo;See here, Sāriputta: you grant this to be true?&rdquo; (mentioning some point). Sāriputta granted the point.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The hint thus given, he knew that Sāriputta had taken his meaning, and would answer fully, starting from the very elements of being. Then the question stood out clear before the elder, as with a hundred hints, nay, a thousand; and he, at the Teacher&rsquo;s hint given, answered the question which belonged to a Buddha&rsquo;s scope.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">And the following was the story of the past he then told.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a2912"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, <a id="a2913"></a><span class="t11">the Bodhisatta was born a northern brahmin and completed his education at Taxila. Putting sensual desires from him and renouncing the world for the ascetic&rsquo;s life, he won the five Super Knowledges and eight Attainments, and dwelt in the Himālayas, where five hundred ascetics gathered round him. One rainy season, his chief disciple went with half the ascetics to the haunts of men to get salt and vinegar. And that was the time when the Bodhisatta should die. And his disciples, wishing to know his spiritual attainment, said to him, &ldquo;What excellence have you won?&rdquo;</span><a id="a2914"></a><a id="a2915"></a> the Bodhisatta, as he expired in his forest-home, exclaimed, &ldquo;Neither conscious nor unconscious.&rdquo;<a id="a2916"></a><a href="notes.html#a14954"><span class="t9">{350}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">And the recluses did not believe the interpretation which the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s chief disciple gave of the Teacher&rsquo;s words. The Bodhisatta came back from the Radiant Realm, and from mid-air recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Ye saññino te pi duggatā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ye pi asaññino te pi duggatā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Etaṁ ubhayaṁ vivajjaya,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Taṁ samāpattisukhaṁ anaṅgaṇan-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Those who are conscious fare badly, those unconscious fare badly too, you should abandon both of these, bliss of attainment is spotless.</span></p>
<p class="p23">His lesson ended, the Bodhisatta praised his disciple and went back to the Brahmā Realm. Then the rest of the recluses believed the chief disciple.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson taught, the Teacher identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;In those days Sāriputta was the chief disciple, and I Mahābrahma.&rdquo;</span></p>
