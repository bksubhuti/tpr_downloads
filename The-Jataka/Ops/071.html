<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Four gates.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[4.1] {4.1}</span><a id="a10085"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain unruly person. The circumstances have already been set forth in the first Jātaka of the Ninth Book [Ja 427].</span><a id="a10086"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15758"><span class="t9">{726}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10087"></a><a id="a10088"></a><span class="t34">This story the Teacher told at Jetavana concerning a disobedient monk. He was, they say, of gentle birth, and though ordained in the dispensation that leads to safety, was admonished by his well-wishers, masters, teachers, and fellow-students to this effect, &ldquo;Thus must you advance and thus retreat; thus look at or away from objects; thus must the arm be stretched out or drawn back; thus are the inner and outer garment to be worn; thus is the bowl to be held, and when you have received sufficient food to sustain life, after self-examination, thus are you to partake of it, keeping guard over the door of the senses; in eating you are to be moderate and exercise watchfulness; you are to recognize such and such duties towards monks who come to or go from the monastery; these are the fourteen sets of monastic duties, and the eighty great duties to be duly performed; these are the thirteen ascetic practices; all these are to be scrupulously performed.&rdquo; Yet was he disobedient and impatient, and did not receive instruction respectfully, but refused to listen to them, saying: &ldquo;I do not find fault with you. Why do you speak thus to me? I shall know what is for my good, and what is not.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then the monks, hearing of his disobedience, sat in the Dhamma Hall, telling of his faults. The Teacher came and asked them what it was they were discussing, and sent for the monk.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Here again the Teacher asked this monk, &ldquo;Is it true, as they say, that you are disobedient?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Long ago,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when by disobedience you refused to do the bidding of wise men, a razor-wheel was given to you.&rdquo; And he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10089"></a><a id="a10090"></a><a id="a10091"></a><a id="a10092"></a>In the past, in the days of Kassapa, the One with Ten Powers, there dwelt in Benares a merchant, whose wealth was eighty crores of money, having a son named Mittavindaka. The mother and father of this lad had entered upon the First Path, but he was wicked, an unbeliever.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10093"></a>When by and by the father was dead and gone, the mother, who in his stead managed their property, thus said to her son, &ldquo;My son, the state of man is one hard to attain;<a id="a10094"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15760"><span class="t9">{727}</span></a> give alms, practise virtue, keep the holy day, give ear to the Dhamma.&rdquo; Then said he, &ldquo;Mother, no almsgiving or such like for me; never name them to me; as I live, so shall I fare hereafter.&rdquo; On a certain full-moon holy day, as he spoke in this fashion, his mother answered, &ldquo;Son, this day is set apart as a high holy day. Today take upon you the holy day vows; visit the cloister, and all night long listen to the Dhamma, and when you come back I will give you a thousand pieces of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">For desire of this money the son consented. As soon as he had broken his fast he went to the monastery, and there he spent the day; but at <span class="t18">[4.2] </span>night, to ensure that not one word of the Dhamma should reach his ear, <span class="t18">{4.2}</span> he lay down in a certain place, and fell asleep. On the next day, very early in the morning, he washed his face, and went to his own house and sat down.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the mother thought within herself, &ldquo;Today my son after hearing the Dhamma will come back early in the morning, bringing with him the elder who has preached the Dhamma.&rdquo; So she made ready gruel, and food hard and soft, and prepared a seat, and awaited his coming. When she saw her son coming all alone, &ldquo;Son,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;why have you not brought the preacher with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;No preacher for me, mother!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Here then,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;you drink this gruel.&rdquo; &ldquo;You promised me a thousand pieces, mother,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;first give this to me, and afterward I will drink.&rdquo; &ldquo;Drink first, my son, and then you shall have the money.&rdquo; Said he, &ldquo;No, I will not drink till I get the money.&rdquo; Then his mother laid before him a purse of a thousand pieces. And he drank the gruel, took the purse with a thousand pieces, and went about his business; and so thereafter, until in no long time he had gained two million.</p>
<p class="p7">Then it came into his mind that he would equip a ship, and do business with it. So he equipped a ship, and said to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, I mean to do business in this ship.&rdquo; Said she, &ldquo;You are my only son, and in this house there is plenty of wealth; the sea is full of dangers. Do not go!&rdquo; But he said: &ldquo;Go I will, and you cannot prevent me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I will prevent you,&rdquo; she answered, and took hold of his hand; but he thrust her hand away, and struck her down, and in a moment he was gone, and under way.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10095"></a>On the seventh day, because of Mittavindaka, the ship stood immovable upon the deep. Lots were cast, and thrice was the lot found in the hand of Mittavindaka.<a id="a10096"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15762"><span class="t9">{728}</span></a> Then they gave him a raft; and saying: &ldquo;Let not many perish for the sole sake of this one,&rdquo; they cast him adrift upon the deep. In an instant the ship sprang forth with speed over the deep.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10097"></a><a id="a10098"></a>And he upon his raft came to a certain island. There in a crystal palace he espied four female spirits of the dead. <span class="t18">{4.3}</span> They used to be in woe seven days and seven in happiness. In their company he experienced bliss divine. Then, when the time came for them to undergo their penance, they said: &ldquo;Master, we are going to leave you for seven days; while we are gone, bide here, and be not distressed.&rdquo; So saying they departed.</p>
<p class="p7">But he, full of longing, again embarked upon his raft, and passing over the ocean came to another isle; there in a palace of silver he saw <span class="t18">[4.3] </span>eight other spirits. In the same way, he saw upon another island, sixteen in a palace all of jewels, and on yet another, thirty-two that were in a golden hall. With these, as before, he dwelt in divine blessedness, and when they went away to their penance, sailed away once more over the ocean; till at last he beheld a city with four gates, surrounded by a wall. That, they say, is the Ussada hell, the place where many beings, condemned to hell, endure their own deeds: but to Mittavindaka it appeared as though a beautiful city. He thought: &ldquo;I will visit that city, and be its king.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10099"></a><a id="a10100"></a>So he entered, and there he saw a being in torment, supporting a wheel sharp as a razor; but to Mittavindaka it seemed as though that razor-wheel upon his head were a lotus bloom; the five-fold fetters upon his breast seemed as it were a splendid and rich vesture; the blood dripping from his head seemed to be the perfumed powder of red sandalwood; the sound of groaning was as the sound of sweetest song. So approaching he said: &ldquo;Hey, man! Long enough you have been carrying that lotus flower; now give it to me!&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;My lord, no lotus it is, but a razor-wheel.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the first, &ldquo;so you say because you do not wish to give it.&rdquo; Thought the condemned wretch, &ldquo;My past deeds must be exhausted. No doubt this fellow, like me, is here for smiting his mother. Well, I will give him the razor-wheel.&rdquo; Then he said: &ldquo;Here then, take the lotus,&rdquo; and with those words he cast the razor-wheel upon his head; and on his head it fell, crushing it in. In an instant <span class="t18">{4.4}</span> Mittavindaka knew then that it was a razor-wheel, and he said: &ldquo;Take your wheel, take back your wheel!&rdquo; groaning aloud in his pain; but the other had disappeared.</p>
<p class="p7">At that moment the Bodhisatta was a Tree Devatā, and with a great following was making a round through the Ussada hell, and arrived at that spot. Mittavindaka, espying him, cried out, &ldquo;Lord King of the Gods, this razor-wheel is piercing and tearing me like a pestle crushing mustard seeds! What wrong have I committed?&rdquo; and in asking this question he repeated these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Four gates this iron city has, where I am trapped and caught:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A rampart girds me round about: what evil have I wrought?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Now fast are closed the city gates: this wheel destroyeth me:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why like a caged bird am I caught? Why, Yakkha, should it be?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the King of the Gods, to explain the matter to him, uttered these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10101"></a><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;A hundred thousand you, good sir, did own, and twenty eke:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet to a friend you would not lend thine ear, when he would speak.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. Swift did you flee across the sea, a perilous thing, I ween;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The four, the eight, did visit straight, and with the eight, sixteen,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. And with sixteen the thirty-two; and lust did ever feel:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">See now, the meed of utter greed upon your head, this wheel. </span><span class="t18">[4.4]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Who tread the highway of desire that spacious thoroughfare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That highway great, insatiate &ndash; &rsquo;tis theirs this wheel to bear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. Who will not sacrifice their wealth, nor to the path repair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who do not know this should be so &ndash; &rsquo;tis theirs this wheel to bear. </span><span class="t18">{4.5}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. Ponder the issue of your deeds, and see</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How great your wealth, and do not crave to be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lord of ill-got gains; do what friends advise</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And the wheel shall never come nigh to thee.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.6}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a10102"></a>Hearing this, Mittavindaka thought to himself, &ldquo;This Devaputta has explained exactly what I have done. No doubt he knows also the measure of my punishment.&rdquo; And he repeated the ninth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;How long, O Yakkha, shall this wheel upon my head remain?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How many thousand years? Reveal, nor let me ask in vain!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Great Being declared the matter in the tenth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;The wheel shall roll, and on shall roll, no saviour shall appear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fixed on your head till you be dead &ndash; O Mittavinda, hear!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus saying, the Devaputta returned to his own place, and the other fell into great misery.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher, having ended this discourse, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the unruly monk was Mittavindaka, and I myself was the King of the Devas.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h3 class="h30"><a id="ncx16821"></a><a id="a10103"></a><a id="a10104"></a><a id="a10105"></a><a id="a10106"></a><a id="a10107"></a>Ja 440 Kaṇhajātaka<br/>The Story about (the Wise Ascetic) Kaṇha (10s)</h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the Buddha smiled upon entering a park. When asked why, he told a story of an ascetic of old and of the austere life he led, and the boons he asked for from Sakka.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a10108"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the wise ascetic Kaṇha (Kaṇhapaṇḍita),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Anuruddha = (the King of the Devas) Sakka.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a10109"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Renunciation, Aspirations.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Behold that man.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Kapilavatthu, in the Banyan Park, about smiling. </span><span class="t18">{4.7}</span><span class="t30"> At that time they say that the Teacher, wandering afoot with his band of monks in the Banyan Park at evening time, at a certain spot gave a smile. The elder Ānanda said: &ldquo;What can be the cause, what the reason, that the Fortunate One should smile? Not without cause do the Tathāgatas smile. I will ask him, then.&rdquo; So with a gesture of obeisance he asked of this smile. Then the Teacher said to him, &ldquo;In days of yore, Ānanda, there was a certain sage, named Kaṇha, who on this spot of earth lived, meditative, delighting in meditation; and by power of his virtue Sakka&rsquo;s abode was shaken.&rdquo; But as this speech about the smile was not quite clear, at the elder&rsquo;s request he told this story of the past.</span><span class="t18"> [4.5]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10110"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta ruled in Benares, there was a certain childless brahmin, having wealth to the amount of eighty crores, who took upon him the vows of virtue, and prayed for a son; the Bodhisatta was conceived in the womb of this brahmin&rsquo;s wife, and from his black colour they gave him on his nameday the name of Kaṇhakumāra, young Blackie. At the age of sixteen years, being full of splendour, as it were an image of some precious stone, he was sent by his father to Taxila, where he learned all the liberal arts, and returned again. Then his father provided a wife suitable for him. And by and by he came in for all his parent&rsquo;s property.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day, after inspecting his treasure houses, as he sat on his gorgeous divan, he took in his hand a golden plate, and reading upon the golden plate these lines inscribed by his kinsmen of former days, &ldquo;So much of the property gained by such a one, so much by another,&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;Those who won this wealth are seen no more, but the wealth is still seen; not one of them could take it where he is gone; we cannot tie our wealth in a bundle and take it with us to the next world. Seeing that it is connected with the Five Defilements, the better part is to distribute in alms this vain wealth; seeing that this vain body is connected with much disease, to show honour and kindness to the virtuous is the better part; seeing that this transient and vain life is but transient, to strive after spiritual insight is the better part. Therefore these vain treasures I will distribute in alms, that by so doing I may gain the better part.&rdquo; So he rose up from his seat, and having asked the king&rsquo;s consent, he gave bounteous alms.</p>
<p class="p7">Up to the seventh day <span class="t18">{4.8}</span> seeing no diminution in his wealth, he thought: &ldquo;What is wealth to me? While I am yet unmastered by old age, I will even now take the ascetic vow, I will cultivate the Super Knowledges and Attainments, I will become destined for Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm!&rdquo; So he caused all the doors of his dwelling to be set open, and bade them take it all as freely given; and spurning it as a thing unclean, he forsook all desire of the eyes, and amid the lamentations and tears of a great multitude, went forth from the city, even unto the Himālayas region.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10111"></a>There he embraced the solitary life; and seeking out for a pleasant place to dwell in, he found this place, and there he resolved to dwell; and choosing a gourd tree for his place of feeding, there he did abide, and lived at the root of that tree; lodging never within a village he became a dweller in the woods, never a hut of leaves he made, but abode at the foot of this tree, in the open air, sitting ever, or if he desired to lie, lying upon the ground, not a pestle but only teeth to grind his food with, eating only things uncooked by the fire, and never even a grain in the husk passed his lips, eating once in the day, and at one sitting. On the ground, as though he were one with<a id="a10112"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15764"><span class="t9">{729}</span></a> the four elements, he lived, <span class="t18">[4.6] </span><a id="a10113"></a>taking upon him the ascetic virtues.<a id="a10114"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15766"><span class="t9">{730}</span></a> In that Jātaka the Bodhisatta, as we learn, had very few wants.</p>
<p class="p7">Thus before long he attained the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and lived in that spot in meditative Absorption. For wild fruits he went no further afield; when fruit grew upon the tree, he ate the fruit; in time of flowers, he ate flowers; when the leaves grew, he ate leaves; when leaves there were none, he ate the bark of trees. Thus in the highest contentment he lived a long time in that place. As in the morning he used to pick up the fruits of that tree, never once even did he from greediness rise up and pick fruit in any other place. In the place where he sat, he stretched out his hand, and gathered all the fruit that there was within a handsweep; these he would eat as they came, making no distinction between what was pleasing and not pleasing. As he continued to take pleasure in this, by the power of his virtue the yellowstone throne of Sakka grew hot.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10115"></a>(This throne, they say, grows hot when Sakka&rsquo;s life draws towards its end, or when his merit is exhausted and worked out, <span class="t18">{4.9}</span><a id="a10116"></a> or when some mighty being prays, or through the efficacy of virtue in monastics or brahmins full of potency.)<a id="a10117"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15768"><span class="t9">{731}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">Then Sakka thought: &ldquo;Who is it would dislodge me now?&rdquo; Surveying all around, he saw, living in a forest, in a certain spot, the sage Kaṇha, picking up fruit, and knew that yonder was the sage of dread austerity, all sense subdued, &ldquo;To him will I go,&rdquo; he thought: &ldquo;I will cause him to proclaim the Dhamma in trumpet tones, and having heard the teaching that gives peace, I will satisfy him with a boon, and make his tree bear fruit unceasingly, and then I will return here.&rdquo; Then by his mighty power quickly descending, and taking his stand at the root of that tree behind the sage, he said, by way of testing whether or no the sage would be angry at mention of his ugliness, the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10118"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Behold that man, all black of hue, that dwells on this black spot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Black is the meat that he does eat &ndash; my spirit likes him not!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Dark Kaṇha heard him. &ldquo;Who is it speaks to me?&rdquo; by his divine insight he perceived that it was Sakka; and without turning, replied with the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Though black of hue, a brahmin true at heart, O Sakka, see:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Not by skin, but if he do wrong, then black a man must be.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.7]</span></p>
<p class="p6">And then, after this, having explained in their several kinds and blamed the defilements which make black such beings, and praised the goodness of virtue, <span class="t18">{4.10}</span> he discoursed to Sakka, and it was as though he made the moon to rise in the sky. Sakka at the hearing of his discourse, charmed and delighted, offered the Great Being a boon, and repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Fair spoken, brahmin, nobly put, most excellently said:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Choose what you will &ndash; as bids your heart, so let your choice be made.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this the Great Being thought thus within himself. &ldquo;I know how it must be. He wished to test me, and see should I be angry at mention of my ugliness; therefore he abused the colour of my skin, my food, my place of dwelling; perceiving that I was not angry, he is pleased, and offers me a boon; no doubt he thinks that I practise this manner of life through a desire for the power of Sakka or of Brahmā; and now, to make him certain, I must choose these four boons: that I may be calm, that I may have within me no hatred or malice against my neighbour, and that I may have no greed for my neighbour&rsquo;s glory or lust towards my neighbour.&rdquo; Thus pondering, to resolve the doubt of Sakka, the sage uttered the fourth verse, claiming these four boons:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Sakka, the lord of all the world, a choice of blessings gave.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From malice, hatred, covetise, deliverance I would have,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And to be free from every lust: these blessings four I crave.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.11}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hereupon thought Sakka, &ldquo;The sage Kaṇha, in choosing his boon, has chosen four most blameless blessings. Now I will ask him what is good or bad with these four things.&rdquo; And he asked the question by repeating the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;In lust, in hatred, covetise, in malice, brahmin, say</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What evil thing do you behold? This answer me, I pray.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;Hear then,&rdquo; replied the Great Being, and gave utterance to four verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Because hatred, of ill-will bred, aye grows from small to great,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is ever full of bitterness, therefore I want no hate.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &rsquo;Tis ever thus with wicked men: first word, then touch we see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Next fist, then staff, and last of all the swordstroke flashing free:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where malice is, there follows hate &ndash; no malice then for me.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. When men make speed egged on by greed, fraud and deceit arise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And swift pursuit of savage loot &ndash; therefore, no covetise.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Firm are the fetters bound by lust, that thrives abundantly</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Within the heart, for bitter smart &ndash; no lusting then for me.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10119"></a><span class="t18"> {4.13}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka, his questions thus solved, replied, &ldquo;Wise Kaṇha, by you sweetly are my questions answered, with a Buddha&rsquo;s skill; well pleased <span class="t18">[4.8] </span>with you am I; now choose another boon,&rdquo; and he repeated the tenth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Fair spoken, brahmin, nobly put, most excellently said:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Choose what you will &ndash; as bids your heart, so let your choice be made.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Instantly the Bodhisatta repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;O Sakka, lord of all the world, a boon you did me cry.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Where in the woods I ever dwell, where all alone dwell I,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Grant no disease may mar my peace, or break my ecstacy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, thought Sakka, &ldquo;Wise Kaṇha, in choosing a boon, chooses no thing connected with food; all he chooses bears upon the ascetic life.&rdquo; Delighted ever more and more, he added thereto yet another boon and recited another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. &ldquo;Fair spoken, brahmin, nobly put, most excellently said:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Choose what you will &ndash; as bids your heart, so let your choice be made.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And the Bodhisatta, in stating his boon, declared the Dhamma in the concluding verse: <span class="t18">{4.14}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;O Sakka, lord of all the world, a choice you bid declare:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No creature be aught harmed for me, O Sakka, anywhere,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10120"></a><span class="t12">Neither in body nor in mind: this, Sakka, is my prayer.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10121"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15770"><span class="t19">{732}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a10122"></a>Thus the Great Being, on six occasions making choice of a boon, chose only that which pertained to the life of renunciation. Well knew he that the body is diseased, and Sakka cannot do away the disease of it; not with Sakka lies it to cleanse living beings in the Three Doors;<a id="a10123"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15772"><span class="t9">{733}</span></a><a id="a10124"></a> albeit so, he made his choice to the end that he might declare the Dhamma to him. And Sakka made that tree bear fruit perennially, and saluting him by raising joined hands to his head,<a id="a10125"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15774"><span class="t9">{734}</span></a> he said: &ldquo;Dwell here ever free from disease,&rdquo; and went to his own place. But the Bodhisatta, never breaking his Absorption, became destined for the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This lesson ended, the Teacher said: &ldquo;This, Ānanda, is the place where I dwelt previously,&rdquo; and thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Anuruddha was Sakka, and for myself, I was Kaṇha the Wise.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Teacher told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the Perfection of Wisdom. One day the monks raised a discussion in the Dhamma Hall, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, the Teacher has great and wide wisdom, he is ready and quick-witted, he is sharp and keen-witted and able to crush the arguments of his opponents, by the power of his wisdom he overthrows the subtle questions propounded by noble sages and reduces them to silence, and having established them in the three refuges and the moral precepts, causes them to enter on the path which leads to immortality.&rdquo; The Teacher came and asked what was the topic which the monks were debating as they sat together; and on hearing what it was he said: &ldquo;It is not wonderful, monks, that the Tathāgata, having attained the Perfection of Wisdom, should overthrow the arguments of his opponents and convert nobles and others. For in the earlier ages, when he was still seeking for supreme knowledge, he was wise and able to crush the arguments of his opponents. Yea verily in the time of Vidhurakumāra, on the summit of the Black Mountain which is sixty leagues in height, by the force of my wisdom I converted the Yakkha general, Puṇṇaka, and reduced him to silence and made him give his own life as a gift,&rdquo; and so saying he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10137"></a><span class="t11">In the past in the Kuru kingdom in the city of Indapatta a king ruled named Dhanañjayakoravya. He had a minister named the wise Vidhura who gave his instructions concerning temporal and spiritual matters; and having a sweet tongue and great eloquence in discoursing on the Dhamma, he bewitched all the kings of Jambudīpa by his sweet discourses concerning the Dhamma as elephants are fascinated by a favourite lute. Nor did he suffer them to depart to their own kingdoms, but dwelt in that city in great glory, teaching the Dhamma to the people with all the power of a Buddha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now there were four rich brahmin householders in Benares, friends, who, having seen the misery of desires, went into the Himālayas and embraced the ascetic life, and having entered upon the Super Knowledges and Attainments, continued to dwell a long time there, feeding on the forest roots and fruits, and then, as they went their rounds to procure salt and sour condiments, came to beg in the city Kālacampā in the kingdom of Aṅga.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">There four householders who were friends, being pleased with their behaviour, having paid them respect and taken their begging vessels, waited upon then with choice food, each in his own house, and taking their promise arranged a home for them in their garden. So the four ascetics having taken their food in the houses of the four householders, went away to pass the day, one going to the heaven of the Thirty-Three, another to the world of the Nāgas, another to the world of the Supaṇṇas, and the fourth to the park Migācira belonging to the Koravya king.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now he who spent his day in the world of the gods, after beholding Sakka&rsquo;s glory, described it in full to his attendant, and so too did he who spent his day in the Nāga and Supaṇṇa world, and so too he who spent his day in the park of the Koravya king Dhanañjaya; each described in full the glory of that respective king.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">So these four attendants desired these heavenly abodes, and having performed gifts and other works of merit, at the end of their lives, one was born as Sakka, another was born with a wife and child in the Nāga world, another was born as the Supaṇṇa king in the palace of the Simbali lake, and the fourth was conceived by the chief queen of king Dhanañjaya; while the four ascetics were reborn in the Brahmā Realm.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The Koravya prince grew up, and on his father&rsquo;s death assumed his kingdom and ruled in righteousness, but he was famed for his skill in dice. He listened to the instruction of the wise Vidhura and gave alms and kept the moral law and observed the fast. One day when he had undertaken the fast, he went into the garden, determining to practise pious meditation, and, having seated himself in a pleasant spot, he performed the duties of an ascetic. Sakka also, having undertaken to keep the fast, found that there were obstacles in the world of the gods, so he went into that very garden in the world of men, and, having seated himself in a pleasant spot, performed the duties of an ascetic. Varuṇa also, the Nāga king, having undertaken to keep the fast, found that there were obstacles in the Nāga world, so he went into that same garden, and, having seated himself in a pleasant place, performed the duties of an ascetic. The Supaṇṇa king also, having undertaken to keep the fast, found that there were obstacles in the Supaṇṇa world, so he went into that same garden, and, having seated himself in a pleasant spot, performed the duties of an ascetic.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Then these four, having risen from their places at evening time, as they stood on the bank of the royal lake, came together and looked at one another, and, being filled with their old kindly affection, they awakened their former friendship and sat down with a pleasant greeting. Sakka sat down on a royal seat, and the others seated themselves as befitted the dignity of each.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10138"></a><a id="a10139"></a><span class="t11">Then Sakka said to them, &ldquo;We are all four kings &ndash; now what is the preeminent virtue of each?&rdquo; Then Varuṇa the Nāga king replied, &ldquo;My virtue is superior to that of you three,&rdquo; and when they inquired why, he said: &ldquo;This Supaṇṇa king is our enemy, whether before or after we are born, yet even when I see him, such a destructive enemy of our race, I never feel any anger; therefore my virtue is superior,&rdquo; and he then uttered the first verse of the Catuposathajātaka [Ja 441]:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25"> 1. &ldquo;The good man who feels no anger towards one who merits anger and who never lets anger arise within him, he who even when angered does not allow it to be seen &ndash; him they indeed call an ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">&ldquo;These are my qualities; therefore my virtue is superior.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The Supaṇṇa king, hearing this, said: &ldquo;This Nāga is my chief food; but since, even though I see such food at hand, I endure my hunger and do not commit evil for the sake of food, my virtue is superior,&rdquo; and he uttered this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">2. &ldquo;He who bears hunger with a pinched belly, a self-restrained ascetic who eats and drinks by rule, and commits no evil for the sake of food &ndash; him they indeed call an ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Then Sakka the King of the Devas said: &ldquo;I left behind various kinds of heavenly glory, all immediate sources of happiness, and came to the world of mankind in order to maintain my virtue &ndash; therefore my virtue is superior,&rdquo; and he uttered this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">3. &ldquo;Having abandoned all sport and pleasure, he utters no false word in the world, he is averse to all outward pomp and carnal desire &ndash; such a man they indeed call an ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Thus did Sakka describe his own virtue.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Then king Dhanañjaya said: &ldquo;I today have abandoned my court and my harem with sixteen thousand dancing girls, and I practise an ascetic&rsquo;s duties in a garden; therefore my virtue is superior,&rdquo; and he added this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10140"></a><span class="t25">4. &ldquo;Those who with full knowledge abandon all that they call their own and all the workings of lust, he who is self-restrained, resolute, unselfish, and free from desire &ndash; him they indeed call an ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Thus they each declared their own virtue as superior, and then they asked Dhanañjaya, &ldquo;O king, is there any wise man in your court who could solve this doubt?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, O kings, I have the wise Vidhura, who fills a post of unequalled responsibility and declares civil and ecclesiastical law, he will solve our doubt, we will go to him.&rdquo; They at once consented. So they all went out of the garden and proceeded to the hall for monastic assemblies, and, having ordered it to be adorned, they seated the Bodhisatta on a high seat, and, having offered him a friendly greeting, sat down on one side and said: &ldquo;O wise sir! A doubt has risen in our minds, do you solve it for us:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">5. We ask you the minister of lofty wisdom: a dispute has arisen in our utterances &ndash; do you consider and solve our perplexities today, let us through you today escape from our doubt.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The wise man, having heard their words, replied, &ldquo;O kings, how shall I know what you said well or ill concerning your virtue, as you uttered the verses in your dispute?&rdquo; and he added this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">6-7. &ldquo;Those wise men who know the real state of things and who speak wisely at the proper time &ndash; how shall they, however wise, draw out the meaning of verses which have not been uttered to them? How does the Nāga king speak, how Garuḷa, the son of Vinatā? Or what says the king of the Gandhabbas? Or how speaks the most noble king of the Kurus?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Then they uttered this verse to him:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10141"></a><span class="t25">8. &ldquo;The Nāga king preaches forbearance, Garuḷa the son of Vinatā gentleness, the king of the Gandhabbas abstinence from carnal lust, and the most noble king of the Kurus freedom from all hindrances.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Then the Great Being, having heard their words, uttered this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10142"></a><span class="t25">9. &ldquo;All these sayings are well spoken &ndash; there is nothing here uttered amiss; and he in whom these are properly fitted like the spokes in the nave of a wheel &ndash; he, who is endowed with these four virtues, is called an ascetic indeed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Thus the Great Being declared the virtue of each of them to be one and the same. Then the four, when they heard him, were well pleased, and uttered this verse in his praise:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">10. &ldquo;You are the best, you are incomparable, you are wise, a guardian and knower of the Dhamma: having grasped the problem by your wisdom, you cut the doubts in your skill as the ivory-workman the ivory with his saw.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Thus all the four were pleased with his explanation of their question. Then Sakka rewarded him with a robe of heavenly silk, Garuḷa with a golden garland, Varuṇa the Nāga king with a jewel, and king Dhanañjaya with a thousand cows, etc.; then Dhanañjaya addressed him in this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">11. &ldquo;I give you a thousand cows and a bull and an elephant, and these ten chariots drawn with thoroughbred horses, and sixteen excellent villages, being well pleased with your solution of the question.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Then Sakka and the rest, having paid all honour to the Great Being, departed to their own abodes.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a10153"></a><span class="t30">At Sāvatthi, it is said, a certain lay brother having heard the Tathāgata&rsquo;s discourse, being pleased at heart, gave an invitation for the morrow; at his door he set up a pavilion, richly decorated, and sent to say that it was time. The Teacher came attended by five hundred monks, and sat in the gorgeous seat appointed for him. The layman, having made rich presents to the company of monks headed by the Buddha, bade them again for the morrow; and so for seven days he invited them, and offered gifts, and on the seventh gave them all a monk&rsquo;s requisites. In this presentation he offered a special gift of shoes. The pair of shoes offered to the Buddha were worth a thousand pieces of money, those offered to the two chief disciples</span><a id="a10154"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15782"><span class="t9">{737}</span></a><span class="t30"> were worth five hundred, and shoes to the value of a hundred were given to each of the five hundred monks who remained. And after this presentation made of all that the monks need, he sat down before the Fortunate One, along with his company. Then the Teacher returned thanks in a voice of much sweetness, &ldquo;Layman, most generous is your gift; be joyful. In olden days, before the Buddha came into the world, there were those who by giving one pair of shoes to a Paccekabuddha, in consequence of that gift found a refuge on the sea where refuge there is none; and you have given to the whole of Buddha&rsquo;s company all that a monk can need &ndash; how can it be, but that your gift of shoes should prove a refuge to you?&rdquo; and at his request, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, this Benares was named Molinī. While Brahmadatta reigned in Molinī as king, a certain brahmin Saṅkha, rich, of great wealth, had built alms halls in six places, one at each of the four city gates, one in the midst of it, one by his own door. Daily he gave in alms six hundred thousand pieces of money, and to wayfarers and beggars he did much bounty. <span class="t18">[4.10]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10155"></a>One day he thought to himself, &ldquo;My store of wealth once gone, I shall have nothing to give. While it is still available I will take ship, and sail for the Gold Country,<a id="a10156"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15784"><span class="t9">{738}</span></a> whence I will bring back wealth.&rdquo; So he caused a ship to be built; filled it with merchandise; and said he, as he bade farewell to wife and child, <span class="t18">{4.16}</span> &ldquo;Until I come again, see that you make no stay in distributing of alms.&rdquo; This said, he took up his sunshade, donned his shoes, and with his servants about him, setting his face towards the seaport, at midday he departed.</p>
<p class="p7">At that moment, a Paccekabuddha on Mount Gandhamādana, meditating, saw him on his way to get wealth, and he thought: &ldquo;A great man is journeying to get wealth: will there be anything on the sea to hinder him, or no? There will. If he sees me he will present me with shoes and sunshade; and in consequence of this gift of shoes, he will find refuge when his vessel is wrecked upon the sea. I will help him.&rdquo; So passing through the air, he alighted not far from the traveller, and moved to meet him, treading the sand hot as a layer of burning embers in the fierce wind and sunshine. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; thought the brahmin, &ldquo;is a chance of gaining merit; here I must sow a seed this day.&rdquo; In high delight he made haste to meet and greet him. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;be so kind as to come aside from the road awhile, under this tree.&rdquo; Then as the man came in beneath the tree, he brushed up the sand for him, and spread his upper robe, and made him sit down; with water perfumed and purified he washed his feet, anointed him with sweet scented oil; from his own feet he took off the shoes, wiped them clean and anointed them with scented oil, and put them on him, and presented him with shoes and sunshade, bidding him wear the one, and spread the other overhead as he went his ways. The other, to please him, took the gift, and as the brahmin gazed upon him for the increase of his faith, flew up and went on his way again to Gandhamādana.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10157"></a>The Bodhisatta on his part, glad at heart, proceeded to the harbour, and took ship. When they were come to the high seas, on the seventh day the ship sprang a leak, and they could not bale the water clear. All the people in fear for their lives made a great outcry, calling each upon his own god.<a id="a10158"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15786"><span class="t9">{739}</span></a> <span class="t18">{4.17}</span> The Great Being chose him one servitor, and anointing all his body with oil, ate a mess of powdered sugar with ghee as much as he desired, and giving the man to eat also, he climbed up the mast. &ldquo;In that direction,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;lies our city,&rdquo; pointing out the direction, and casting off all fear of the fish and turtles, he dived off with the man to a <span class="t18">[4.11] </span>distance of more than a hundred and fifty cubits. A multitude of men perished; but the Great Being, with his servant, began to make his way over the sea. For seven days he kept on swimming. Even then he kept the holy fast day, washing his mouth with the salt water.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10159"></a>Now at that time a Devadhītā named Maṇimekhalā, which by interpretation is Jewel-zone, had been commanded by the four lords of the world, &ldquo;If by shipwreck any ill befall men who have gone to the Three Refuges, or are endued with virtue, or who worship their parents, you should save them,&rdquo; and to protect any such, the deity took station upon the sea. In her divine power she kept no outlook for seven days, but on the seventh day, scanning the sea, she saw the virtuous brahmin Saṅkha, and thought she, &ldquo;It is now the seventh day since that man was cast into the sea: were he to die, great would be my blame.&rdquo; So troubled at heart the deity filled a golden plate full of all manner of divine meats, and hastening wind-swift towards him, came to a stop before him in mid-air, saying: &ldquo;Seven days, brahmin, have you taken no food: eat this!&rdquo; The brahmin looked at her, and replied, &ldquo;Take your food away, for I am keeping fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">His attendant, who came behind, saw not the deity, but heard only the sound; and he thought: &ldquo;The brahmin babbles, I think, being of tender frame, and from his seven days&rsquo; fasting, being in pain and in fear of death: I will comfort him.&rdquo; And he repeated the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;O learned brahmin, full of sanctity,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pupil of many a holy teacher, why </span><span class="t18">{4.18}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All out of reason do vain babbling use,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">When none is here, save me, to make reply?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The brahmin heard, and knowing that he had not seen the deity, he said: &ldquo;Good fellow, &rsquo;tis not fear of death; but I have another here to converse with me,&rdquo; and he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis a fair radiant presence, gold-besprent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That offers me food for my nourishment,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All bravely set upon a plate of gold:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To her I answer &lsquo;No,&rsquo; with heart content.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the man repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;If such a wondrous being one should see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A man should ask a blessing hopefully.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Arise, beseech her, holding up clasped hands:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10160"></a><span class="t12">Say, are you human, or a deity?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.19}</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;You say well,&rdquo; said the brahmin, and asked his question by repeating the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;As you beholdest me in kindly way</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And &lsquo;Take and eat this food&rsquo; to me do say,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I ask you, lady, excellent in might,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10161"></a><span class="t12">Are you a Devī, or a woman, pray?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.12]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thereupon the Devadhītā repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;A Devī excellent in might am I;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And to mid-ocean hitherward did hie,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Full of compassion and in heart well-pleased,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For your sake come in this extremity.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Here food, and drink, and place of rest behold,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Vehicles various and manifold;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You, Saṅkha, I make lord of every thing</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which for desirable your heart may hold.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the Great Being thought it over. &ldquo;Here is this Devadhītā (thought he), in the middle of the ocean, offering me this thing and that thing. Why does she wish to offer them to me? Is it for any virtuous act of mine, or by her own power, she does it? Well, I will ask the question.&rdquo; And he asked it in the words of the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Of all my sacrifice and offering</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You are the queen, and thine the governing;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10162"></a><span class="t12">You of fair slender waist, you beauteous-browed:</span><a id="a10163"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15788"><span class="t19">{740}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What deed of mine hath brought to fruit this thing?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.20}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Devadhītā listened to him, thinking: &ldquo;This brahmin has put his question, I suppose, because he imagines I know not what good deed he has done. I will just tell him.&rdquo; So she told him, in the words of the eighth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;A solitary, on the burning way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Weary and footsore, thirsty, you did stay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10164"></a><span class="t12">O brahmin Saṅkha, for a gift of shoes:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That gift your Cow of Plenty is this day.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the Great Being heard this, he thought to himself, &ldquo;What! In this impracticable ocean the gift of shoes given by me has become a give-all to me! Ah, lucky was my gift to the Paccekabuddha!&rdquo; Then, in great contentment, he repeated the ninth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;A ship of planks well built let there be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sped by fair winds, impervious to the sea;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No place is here for other vehicle;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10165"></a><span class="t12">This very day take me to Molinī.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10166"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15790"><span class="t19">{741}</span></a><span class="t12"> </span><span class="t18">{4.21}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a10167"></a>The Devadhītā, well pleased at hearing these words, caused a ship to appear, made of the seven things of price; in length it was eight hundred cubits, in width six hundred cubits, twenty fathoms in depth; it had three masts made of sapphire, cordage of gold, silver sails, and of gold were also the oars and the rudders. This vessel the deity filled with the seven precious things; then embracing the brahmin, set him aboard the gorgeous ship. She did not notice the attendant; howbeit the brahmin <span class="t18">[4.13] </span>gave him a share of his own good fortune; he rejoiced, the deity embraced him also, and set him in the ship. Then she guided the ship to the city of Molinī, and having stored all this wealth in the brahmin&rsquo;s house, returned to her place of dwelling.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, after Fully Awakening, uttered the final verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;She pleased, delighted, with a happy cheer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A vessel marvellous caused to appear;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then, taking Saṅkha with his serving man,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To that most lovely city brought them near.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And the brahmin all his life long dwelt at home, distributing bounty without end, and observing virtue; and at the end of his days he with his man went to swell the host of heaven.<span class="t18"> {4.22}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had made an end of this discourse he declared the Truths: now at the conclusion of the Truths the layman entered upon the First Path: and he thus identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Uppalavaṇnā was the Devadhītā [Maṇimekhalā], Ānanda was the attendant, and I myself was the brahmin Saṅkha.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;If one seize.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10177"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told in Jetavana, about a passionate man. This man, after having become an ascetic in this dispensation which leads to safety with all its blessings, was unable to control his passion: passionate he was, full of resentment; but little said, and he grew angry, flew in a passion, was bitter and obstinate. The Teacher, hearing of his passionate behaviour, sent for him and asked, was it true that he was passionate, as rumour had it. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;Monk,&rdquo; the Teacher said, &ldquo;passion must be restrained; such an ill-doer has no place either in this world or the next. After embracing the dispensation of the Supreme Buddha, who knows not passion, why do you show thyself passionate? Wise men of old, even those who embraced an outside dispensation,</span><a id="a10178"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15792"><span class="t9">{742}</span></a><a id="a10179"></a><span class="t30"> have refrained from anger.&rdquo; And he told him a story of the past.</span><span class="t18"> [4.14]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10180"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, there was in a certain town of Kāsi a brahmin rich, wealthy, and of great possessions, but he was childless; and his wife longed for a son. At that time the Bodhisatta, descending from the Brahmā Realm, was conceived in the womb of that lady; and on his name-day they gave him the name of Bodhikumāra, or Wiseman. When he came of age he repaired to Taxila, where he studied all sciences; and after his homecoming, much against his will, his parents found him a damsel to wife from a family of the same caste. She too had descended to this world from the Brahmā Realm, and was of surpassing beauty, like a Devaccharā. These two were married together, though neither of them desired it. Never had either done any wrong, and in the way of passion neither so much as cast a look at the other; never even in sleep had they done the deed of kind, so pure were they.</p>
<p class="p7">Now it happened that after a while, when his parents were dead, and he had decently disposed of their bodies, the Great Being calling his wife, said to her, &ldquo;Now, lady, you <span class="t18">{4.23}</span> take this fortune of eighty crores, and live in happiness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not so, but you, noble sir.&rdquo; Said he, &ldquo;Wealth I want none; I shall go to the region of the Himālayas, and become a recluse, and there find a refuge.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, noble sir, is it men only that should live the ascetic life?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but women also.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I will not take that which you spew out of your mouth; for wealth I care no more than you, and I, like you, will live as a recluse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very good, lady,&rdquo; said he. And they both distributed a great quantity of alms; and setting forth, in a pleasant spot they made a hermitage. There living upon any wild fruits which they could glean, they dwelt for ten whole years, yet did not attain Absorption.</p>
<p class="p7">And after living there in the happiness of the ascetic life for ten years, they traversed the countryside to get salt and seasoning, and in due course came to Benares, where they resided in the royal park.</p>
<p class="p7">Now one day the king, espying the park-keeper who came with a present in his hand, said: &ldquo;We will make merry in our park, therefore set it in order,&rdquo; and when the park was cleansed and made ready, he entered it along with a great retinue. At that time these two were also sitting in a certain part of the park, spending their time in the bliss of the ascetic life. And the king in passing through the park, perceived them both sitting there; and as his eye fell on this amiable and very beautiful lady, he fell in love. Trembling with desire, he determined to ask what she was to the ascetic; so approaching the Bodhisatta, he put the question to him. &ldquo;Great king,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she is nothing to me; she only shares my ascetic life, but when I lived in the world she was my wife.&rdquo; On hearing this the king thought within him, &ldquo;So he says she is nothing to him. but in his worldly life she was his wife. Well, if I <span class="t18">[4.15] </span>seize her by my sovereign power what will he do? I will take her, then.&rdquo; And so coming near he repeated the first verse: <span class="t18">{4.24}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;If one seize the large-eyed lady, and carry her off from you,</span><a id="a10181"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15794"><span class="t19">{743}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The dear one that sits there smiling, brahmin, what would you do?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">In answer to this question, the Great Being repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Once risen, it never would leave me my life long, no, never at all:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As a storm of rain lays the dust again, quench it while yet it be small.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Thus did the Great Being make answer, loud as a lion&rsquo;s roar. But the king, though he heard it, was yet unable for blind folly to master his enamoured heart, and gave orders to one of his suite that he should take the lady into the palace. The courtier, obedient, led her away, in spite of her complaints and cries that lawlessness and wrong were the world&rsquo;s way. The Bodhisatta, who heard her cries, looked once but looked no more. So weeping and wailing she was conveyed to the palace.</p>
<p class="p7">And the king of Benares made no delay in his park, but quickly returned indoors, and sending for the woman, showed her great honour. And she spoke of the worthlessness of such honour, and the sole worth of the solitary life. The king, finding that by no means could he win her mind over, caused her to be placed in a room apart, and began to think, &ldquo;Here is an ascetic woman who cares not for all this honour, and that ascetic never cast an angry look even when the man led away so beauteous a dame! Deep are the wiles of ascetics; he will lay a plot doubtless and work me some harm. <span class="t18">{4.25}</span> Well, I will return to him, and find out why he sits there.&rdquo; And so unable to keep still, he went into the park.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta sat stitching his cloak. The king, almost alone, came up without sound of footfall, softly. Without one look at the king, the other went on with his sewing. &ldquo;This fellow,&rdquo; thought the king, &ldquo;will not speak to me because he is angry. This ascetic, humbug that he is, first roars out, &ldquo;I will not let anger arise at all, but if it does, I will crush it while it is small,&rdquo; and then is so obstinate in wrath that he won&rsquo;t speak to me!&rdquo; With this idea the king repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;You that were loud in boasting only awhile ago,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now dumb for very anger there you sit and sew!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the Great Being heard this, he perceived that the king thought him silent from anger; and desirous to show that he was not influenced by anger, repeated the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Once risen, it never had left me, it never would leave me at all:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As a storm of rain lays the dust again, I quenched it while it was small.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing these words, the king thought: &ldquo;Is it anger of which he <span class="t18">[4.16] </span>speaks, or some other thing? I will ask him.&rdquo; And he asked the question, repeating the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;What is it that never has left you your life long, never at all?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As a storm of rain lays the dust again, what quenched you while it was small?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.26}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Said the other, &ldquo;Great king, anger brings much wretchedness, and much ruin; it just began within me, but by cherishing kindly feelings I quenched it,&rdquo; and then he repeated the following verses to declare the misery of anger.</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;That without which a man sees clearly, with which he goes blindly ahead,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Arose within me, but was not left free &ndash; anger, on foolishness fed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. What causes our foes satisfaction, who wish to bring woes on our head,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Arose within me, but was not left free &ndash; anger, on foolishness fed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. That which if it rises within us blinds all to our spiritual good,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Arose within me, but was not left free &ndash; anger, with folly for food.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. That which, supreme, destroys each great blessing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Which makes its dupes forsake each worthy thing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Mighty, destructive, with its swarm of fears &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Anger &ndash; refused to leave me, O great king!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. The fire will rise the higher, if the fuel be stirred and turned;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And because the fire uprises, the fuel itself is burned.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. And thus in the mind of the foolish, the man who cannot discern,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From wrangling arises anger, and with it himself will burn.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. Whose anger grows like fire with fuel and grass that blaze,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As the moon in the dark fortnight, so his honour wanes and decays.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. He who quiets his anger, like a fire that fuel has none,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As the moon in the light fortnight, his honour waxes well grown.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.27}</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the king had listened to the Great Being&rsquo;s discourse, he was well pleased, and bade one of his courtiers lead the woman back; and invited the passionless recluse to stay with her in that park, in the enjoyment of their solitary life, and he promised to watch over them and defend them as he ought. Then asking pardon, he politely took leave, and the two of them dwelt there. By and by the woman died, and after her death, the man returned to the Himālayas, and cultivating the Super Knowledges and Attainments, and causing the Divine Abidings to spring up within him, he became destined for Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended his discourse, he declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka; now at the conclusion of the Truths the passionate monk became established in the fruit of the Third Path. &ldquo;At that time Rāhula&rsquo;s mother was the ascetic lady, Ānanda was the king, and I myself was the ascetic.&rdquo;</span></p>

The occasion will be explained under the Kusajātaka [Ja 531].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The story tells that he was of noble birth and lived at Sāvatthi, and on his heartily embracing the dispensation he adopted the ascetic life. Now one day as he was going his rounds for alms in Sāvatthi, he met a fair lady and fell in love with her at first sight. Overcome by his passion he lived an unhappy life, and letting his nails and hair grow long and wearing soiled robes, he pined away and became quite sallow, with all his veins standing out on his body. And just as in the Deva world, the Devaputtas who are destined to fall from their heavenly existence manifest five well-known signs, that is to say, their garlands wither, their robes soil, their bodies grow ill-favoured, perspiration pours from their armpits, and they no longer find pleasure in their Deva home, so too in the case of worldly monks, who fall from the Dhamma, the same five signs are to be seen: the flowers of faith wither, the robes of righteousness soil, through discontent and the effects of an evil name their persons grow ill-favoured, the sweat of corruption streams from them and they no longer delight in a life of solitude at the foot of forest trees &ndash; all these signs were to be found in him. So they brought him into the presence of the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;Venerable sir, this fellow is discontented.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had enquired whether this report was true, and the man answered that it was true, </span><span class="t18">{4.28}</span><span class="t30"> he said: &ldquo;Monk, wise men in days long gone by, before the Buddha had arisen, even men who had entered upon an outside sect, for more than fifty years, walking in holiness without caring for it, from the scruples of a sensitive nature never told any one that they had fallen back; and why have you, who have embraced such a dispensation as ours, that leads to safety, and who stand in presence of a venerable Buddha such as I am, why have you declared your discontent before the four kinds of disciples? Why do you not preserve your scruples?&rdquo; Thus saying, he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10198"></a>In the past, in the kingdom of Vaṁsa, reigned in Kosambī<a id="a10199"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15798"><span class="t9">{745}</span></a> a king named Kosambika. At that time there were two brahmins in a certain town, each possessed of eighty crores, and dear friends one of the other; who, having perceived the mischief which lies in lust, and distributed much goods in generosity, both forsook the world, and amid the weeping and wailing of many people, departed to the Himālayas, and there built them a hermitage. There for fifty years they lived as ascetics, feeding upon the fruits and roots of the forests where they might chance to glean them; but unto Absorption they were unable to attain.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10200"></a><a id="a10201"></a>After these fifty years had passed by, they went on pilgrimage through the countryside to get salt and seasoning, and came to the kingdom of Kāsi. In a certain town of this kingdom lived a householder named Maṇḍavya, who had been a lay friend in householder days of the ascetic Dīpāyana. To this Maṇḍavya came our two friends; who when he saw them, enraptured, built them a hut of leaves, and provided them both with the four necessaries of life. Three or four seasons they dwelt there, and then taking leave of him proceeded on pilgrimage to Benares, where they lived in a cemetery grown over with the Hiptage shrub. When Dīpāyana had remained there as long as he wished, he returned to his old comrade again; Maṇḍavya the other ascetic still dwelt in the same place.<a id="a10202"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15800"><span class="t9">{746}</span></a> <span class="t18">[4.18]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Now it happened that one day a robber had committed robbery in the town, and was returning from the fact with a quantity of spoil. The owners of the house, and the watchmen, aroused, set up a cry of, &ldquo;Thief!&rdquo; and the thief, pursued by these, escaped through the sewer, and as he ran swiftly by the cemetery dropped his bundle at the door of the ascetic&rsquo;s hut of leaves. When the owners saw this bundle, they cried, &ldquo;Ah, you rascal! <span class="t18">{4.29}</span> you are a robber by night, and in the daytime you go about in the disguise of an ascetic!&rdquo; So, with reviling and blows, they carried him into the presence of the king.</p>
<p class="p7">The king made no enquiry, but only said: &ldquo;Off with him, impale him upon a stake!&rdquo; To the cemetery they took him, and lifted him up on a stake of acacia wood; but the stake would not pierce the ascetic&rsquo;s body. Next they brought a nimb stake, but this too would not pierce him; then an iron spike, and no more would that pierce his body. The ascetic wondered what past deed of his could have caused this, and surveyed the past; then there arose in him the knowledge of former existences, and by this as he surveyed the past he saw what he had done long ago; and this it was &ndash; the piercing of a fly upon a splinter of ebony.</p>
<p class="p7">It is said that in a former existence he had been the son of a carpenter. Once he went to the place where his father was wont to hew trees, and with an ebony splinter pierced a fly as if impaling it. And it was just this wrong that found him out when he came to that supreme moment. He perceived that here then was no getting free from wrong; so to the king&rsquo;s men he said: &ldquo;If you wish to impale me, take a stake of ebony wood.&rdquo; This they did, and spitted him upon it, and leaving a guard to watch him they went away.</p>
<p class="p7">The watchmen from a place of concealment observing all that came to look upon him. Now Dīpāyana, thinking: &ldquo;It is long since I saw my comrade the ascetic,&rdquo; came to find him; and having heard that he had been hanging a whole day impaled by the roadside, he went up to him, and standing on one side, asked what he had done. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Can you guard against ill feeling, or not?&rdquo; asked the other. &ldquo;Good friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;neither against those who have seized me, nor against the king, either, is there any ill feeling in my mind.&rdquo; &ldquo;If that is so, the shadow of one so virtuous is delightful to me,&rdquo; and with these words he sat down by the side of the stake. Then upon his body from the body of Maṇḍavya fell gouts of gore; and these as they fell upon the golden skin, and dried there, became black spots upon it; which gave him the name of Kaṇha or Black Dīpāyana from thenceforth. And he sat there all the night.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day the watchmen went and told the matter to the king. &ldquo;I <span class="t18">[4.19] </span><a id="a10203"></a>have acted rashly,&rdquo; said the king; and with speed he hastened to the spot, <span class="t18">{4.30}</span><a id="a10204"></a> and asked Dīpāyana what made him sit by the stake. &ldquo;Great king,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I sit here to guard him. But say, what has he done, or what left undone, that you treat him thus?&rdquo; He explained that the matter had not been investigated. The other replied, &ldquo;Great king, a king ought to act with circumspection; an idle layman who loves pleasure is not good, etc.,&rdquo;<a id="a10205"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15802"><span class="t9">{747}</span></a> and with other such admonitions he discoursed to him.</p>
<p class="p7">When the king found that Maṇḍavya was innocent, he ordered the stake to be drawn out. But try as they would, it would not come out. Said Maṇḍavya, &ldquo;Sire, I have received this dire disgrace for a fault done long ago, and it is impossible to draw the stake from my body. But if you wish to spare my life, bring a saw, and cut it off flush with the skin.&rdquo; So the king had this done; and the part of the stake within his body remained there. For on that previous occasion they say that he took a little piece of diamond, and pierced the fly&rsquo;s duct, so that it did not die then, nor until the proper end of its life; and therefore also the man did not die, they say.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10206"></a>The king saluted these ascetics, and craved pardon; and settling them both in his park, he looked after them there. And from that time Maṇḍavya was called Maṇḍavya the Peg. And he lived in this place near the king; and Dīpāyana, after healing his friend&rsquo;s wound, went back to his friend Maṇḍavya the householder. When they saw him enter the leaf-hut, they told it to his friend. When he heard it, he was delighted; and with wife and child, taking plenty of scents, garlands, oil, and sugar, and so forth, he came to the leaf hut; greeting Dīpāyana, washing and anointing his feet, and giving him to drink, he sat listening to the tale of Maṇḍavya the Peg.</p>
<p class="p7">Then his son, a young man named Yaññadatta, was playing with a ball at the end of the covered walk. There a snake lived in an ant-hill. The lad&rsquo;s ball, thrown upon the ground, ran into the hole of the ant-hill and fell upon the snake. Not knowing this, the lad put his hand into the hole. The enraged snake bit the boy&rsquo;s hand; down he fell in a faint because of the strength of the snake&rsquo;s poison. <span class="t18">{4.31}</span> Thereupon his parents, finding their son snake-bitten, lifted him up and took him to the ascetic; laying him at the ascetic&rsquo;s feet, they said: &ldquo;Sir, ordained people know medicines and charms; please cure our son.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know no medicines; I do not ply the physician&rsquo;s trade.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are a man of dispensation. Have pity then, sir, upon this lad, and do the Assertion of Truth.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the ascetic, &ldquo;an Assertion of Truth I will do.&rdquo;And laying hands upon the head of Yaññadatta, he recited the first verse: <span class="t18">[4.20]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Seven days serene in heart</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pure I lived, desiring merit:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Since then, for fifty years apart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Self-absorbed, I do declare it,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here, unwillingly, I live:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May this truth a blessing give:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Poison baulked, the lad revive!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">This Assertion of Truth was no sooner made, out from the chest of Yaññadatta the poison came, and sank into the ground. The lad opened his eyes, and with a look at his parents, cried, &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; then turned over, and lay still. Then Black Dīpāyana said to the father, &ldquo;See, I have used my power; now is the time to use yours.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;So will I do an Assertion of Truth,&rdquo; and laying a hand upon his son&rsquo;s breast, he repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10207"></a><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;If for gifts I cared no jot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All chance comers entertaining, </span><span class="t18">{4.32}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet still the good and wise knew not</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I was my true self restraining;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If unwillingly I give,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May this truth a blessing give,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Poison baulked, the lad revive!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After the making of this Assertion of Truth, out from his back came the poison, and sank into the ground. The lad sat up, but could not stand. Then the father said to the mother, &ldquo;Lady, I have used my power; now it is yours by an Assertion of Truth to cause your son to arise and walk.&rdquo; Said she, &ldquo;I too have a Dhamma to tell, but in your presence I cannot declare it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by all and any means make my son whole.&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and her Assertion of Truth is given in the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;The serpent that bit you today</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In yonder hole, my son,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And this your father, are, I say,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In my indifference, one:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May this Truth a blessing give:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Poison baulked, the lad revive!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.33}</span></p>
<p class="p6">No sooner done was this Assertion of Truth, than all the poison fell and sank into the ground; and Yaññadatta, rising with all his body purged of the poison, began to play. When the son had in this way risen up, Maṇḍavya asked what was in Dīpāyana&rsquo;s mind by the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;They leave the world who are serene, subdued,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Save Kaṇha, all in no unwilling mood;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What makes you shrink, Dīpāyana, and why</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unwilling walk the path of sanctity?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To answer this, the other repeated the fifth verse: <span class="t18">[4.21]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10208"></a><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;He leaves the world, and then again turns back;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">An idiot, a fool! So might one think:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis this that makes me shrink,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus walk I holy, though the wish I lack,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The cause why I do well, is this &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10209"></a><span class="t12">Praised of the wise the good man&rsquo;s dwelling is.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10210"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15805"><span class="t19">{748}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6">Thus having explained his own thought, he asked Maṇḍavya yet again in the sixth verse: <span class="t18">{4.34}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10211"></a><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;This your house was like a mere,</span><a id="a10212"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15807"><span class="t19">{749}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Food and drink in store supplying:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sages, travellers, brahmins here</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thirst and hunger satisfying.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Did you fear some scandal, still</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Giving, yet against your will?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Maṇḍavya explained his thoughts by the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Sire and grandfather holy were,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lords of gifts most free in giving;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And I followed with all care</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Our ancestral way of living;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lest degenerate I should be</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I gave gifts unwillingly.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After saying this, Maṇḍavya asked his wife a question in the words of the eighth verse: <span class="t18">{4.35}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;When, a young girl, with undeveloped sense,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I brought you from your home to be my wife,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You did not tell me your indifference,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How without love you lived all your life.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then why, O fair-limbed lady, did you stay</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And live with me in this unloving way?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And she replied to him by repeating the ninth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis not the custom in this family</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For wedded wife to take a newer mate,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor ever has been; and this custom I</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Would keep, lest I be called degenerate.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Twas fear of such report that bade me stay</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And live with you in this unloving way.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{4.36}</span></p>
<p class="p6">But when this was said, a thought passed through her mind, &ldquo;My secret is told to my husband, the secret never told before! He will be angry with me; I will crave pardon in the presence of this ascetic, our confidant.&rdquo; And to this end she repeated the tenth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Now I have spoken what should be unsaid:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For our son&rsquo;s sake may it be pardoned.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Stronger than parents&rsquo; love is nothing here;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Our Yaññadatta lives, who was but dead!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.22]</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;Arise, lady,&rdquo; said Maṇḍavya, &ldquo;I forgive you. Henceforth do not be hard to me; I will never grieve you.&rdquo; And the Bodhisatta said, addressing Maṇḍavya, &ldquo;In gathering ill-gotten gains, and in disbelieving that when you give liberally, the deed is a seed that brings fruit, in this you have done wrong. For the future believe in the merit of gifts, and give them.&rdquo; This the other promised, and in his turn said to the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Sir, you have yourself done wrong in accepting our gifts when walking the path of holiness against your will. Now in order that your deeds may bear abundant fruit, do you for the future walk in holiness with a tranquil heart and pure, delighting in Absorption.&rdquo; Then they took leave of the Great Being and departed.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10213"></a><a id="a10214"></a><a id="a10215"></a>From that time forward the wife loved her husband; Maṇḍavya with tranquil heart gave gifts with faith; the Bodhisatta, dispelling his unwillingness, cultivated the Absorptions and Super Knowledges, and became destined for Brahmā&rsquo;s Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This discourse ended, the Teacher declared the Truths; now at the conclusion of the Truths the discontented monk was established in the fruit of the First Path; and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Ānanda was Maṇḍavya, </span><span class="t18">{4.37}</span><span class="t30"> Visākhā the wife, Rāhula the son, Sāriputta was Maṇḍavya the Peg, and I was myself Black Dīpāyana.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the monks remind Devadatta of how the Buddha has taught him well, which he denies. The Buddha tells a story of how three children were raised together, and through one of them they attained to power, but through jealousy the one who had helped them was scorned.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><a id="a10221"></a><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = (the orphan who became king) Nigrodha,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Ānanda = (the tailor&rsquo;s son) Pottika,</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Devadatta = (the merchant&rsquo;s son) Sākha.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a10222"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Gratitude, Treachery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Who is the man.&rdquo;</span><a id="a10223"></a><a id="a10224"></a><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told in the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta. One day the monks said to him, &ldquo;Friend Devadatta, the Teacher is most helpful to you! From the Teacher you received your ordination, lesser and greater; you have learned the Three Baskets, the word of the Buddha; you have caused Absorption to arise within you; the glory and gain of the One with Ten Powers belong to you.&rdquo; At this he held up a blade of grass, with the words, &ldquo;I can see no good that the ascetic Gotama has done me, not even this much!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">They talked it over in the Dhamma Hall. When the Teacher came in, he asked what they talked about as they sat together. They told him. Said he, &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time, but long ago as now Devadatta was ungrateful and treacherous to friends.&rdquo; And he told them a tale of olden days.</span><span class="t18"> [4.23]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10225"></a>In the past a great monarch named Magadha reigned in Rājagaha. And a merchant of that city brought home for his son&rsquo;s wife the daughter of some country merchant. But she was barren. In course of time less respect was paid to her for this cause; they all talked, that she might hear, as thus, &ldquo;While there is a barren wife in our son&rsquo;s household, how can the family line be kept up?&rdquo; As this talk kept coming to her ears, she said to herself, &ldquo;Oh, well, I will pretend to be with child, and trick them.&rdquo; So she asked a good old nurse of hers, &ldquo;What is it that women do when they are with child?&rdquo; and being instructed what to do for preserving the child,<a id="a10226"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15809"><span class="t9">{750}</span></a> concealed the time of her courses; showed a fancy for sour and strange tastes; at the time when the arms and legs begin to swell, she caused them to beat hands and feet and back until they grew swollen; day by day she bandaged her body round with rags and cloths and made it appear greater; blackened the nipples of her breasts; and save that nurse alone, permitted no other to be present at her toilet. Her husband too showed her the attentions proper to her state. After nine months had passed in this fashion, she declared her wish to return home and bring forth her child in her father&rsquo;s house. So taking leave of her husband&rsquo;s parents, she mounted a carriage, <span class="t18">{4.38}</span> and with a large number of attendants left Rājagaha behind her, and proceeded along the road.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10227"></a>Now travelling in front of her was a caravan; and she always came about breakfast time to the place whence that caravan had just gone. And one night, a poor woman in that caravan had borne a son under a banyan tree; and thinking that without the caravan she could not get along, but that if she lived she might receive the child, covered him up<a id="a10228"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15812"><span class="t9">{751}</span></a> as he was, and left him lying there, at the foot of the banyan tree. And the deity of the tree took care of him; he was not any ordinary child, but the Bodhisatta himself had come into the world in that form.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10229"></a>At breakfast time the other travellers arrived at the spot. The woman, with her nurse, going apart to the shade of the banyan tree for her toilet, saw a babe of the colour of gold lying there. By and bye she called out to the nurse that their object was gained; unwound the bandages from her loins;<a id="a10230"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15817"><span class="t9">{752}</span></a> and declared that the babe was her own, and that she had just brought him forth.</p>
<p class="p7">The attendants at once raised a tent to seclude her, and in high delight sent a letter back to Rājagaha. Her husband&rsquo;s parents wrote in <span class="t18">[4.24] </span>reply that as the babe was born, there was no longer need for her to go to her father&rsquo;s house; let her return. So to Rājagaha she returned at once. And they acknowledged the babe; and when the babe came to be named, named him after the place where he was born, Nigrodhakumāra, or Master Banyan. That same day, the daughter-in-law of a merchant, on her way home to her father for the birth, brought forth a son beneath the branches of a tree; and him they named Sākhakumāra, Master Branch. And on the same day, the wife of a tailor in the employ of this merchant bore a son amidst his bits of cloth; and him they called Pottika, or Dollie.</p>
<p class="p7">The great merchant sent for these two children, as having been born on Master Banyan&rsquo;s birthday, and brought them up with him.</p>
<p class="p7">They all grew up together, and by and by went to Taxila to complete their education. Both the merchants&rsquo; sons had two thousand pieces to give their teacher for a fee; <span class="t18">{4.39}</span> Master Banyan provided Pottika with an education under his own wing.</p>
<p class="p7">When their education was finished, they took leave of their teacher, and left him, with intent to learn the customs of the country folk; and travelling on and on, in time they came to Benares, and lay down to rest in a temple. It was then the seventh day since the king of Benares had died. Proclamation was made through the city by beat of drum, that on the morrow the festal carriage would be prepared. The three comrades were lying under a tree asleep, when at dawn Pottika awoke, and sitting up began to massage Banyan&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10231"></a><a id="a10232"></a>Some chickens were roosting upon that tree, and the chicken at the top let a dropping fall upon a chicken near the bottom.<a id="a10233"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15821"><span class="t9">{753}</span></a><a id="a10234"></a> &ldquo;What is that fell upon me?&rdquo; asked this chicken. &ldquo;Do not be angry, sir,&rdquo; answered the other, &ldquo;I did not mean to do it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, so you think my body is a place for your droppings! You don&rsquo;t know my importance, that is plain!&rdquo; To this said the other, &ldquo;Oh, still angry, though I declared that I did not mean it! And what is your importance, pray?&rdquo; &ldquo;Whoever kills me and eats my flesh will receive a thousand pieces of money this very morning! Is that not something to be proud of?&rdquo; &ldquo;Pooh, pooh,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;proud of a little thing like that! Why, if any one kills me and eats of my fat, he will become a king this very morning; he that eats the middle flesh, becomes commander-in-chief; who eats the flesh about the bones, he will be treasurer!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">All this Pottika overheard. &ldquo;A thousand pieces &ndash;&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;what is that? Best to be a king!&rdquo; So gently climbing the tree, he seized the chicken that was roosting atop, and killed it, and cooked it in the embers; the fat he gave to Banyan, the middle flesh to Branch, and himself ate the flesh that was about the bones. When they had eaten, he <span class="t18">[4.25] </span>said: &ldquo;Banyan, sir, today you will be king; Branch, sir, you will be commander-in-chief; and as for me, I&rsquo;m the treasurer!&rdquo; They asked him how he knew; he told them.</p>
<p class="p7">So about the time for the first meal of the day, they entered the city of Benares. At the house of a certain brahmin they received a meal of rice-porridge, with ghee and sugar; and then emerging from the city, <span class="t18">{4.40}</span> they entered the royal park.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10235"></a><a id="a10236"></a>Banyan lay down upon a slab of stone, the other two lay beside it. It so happened that at the moment they were just sending forth the ceremonial chariot, with the five symbols of royalty<a id="a10237"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15823"><span class="t9">{754}</span></a><a id="a10238"></a> in it. (The details of this will be given in the Mahājanakajātaka [Ja 539].)<a id="a10239"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15825"><span class="t9">{755}</span></a> In rolled the carriage, and stopping, stood ready for them to enter. &ldquo;Some being of great merit must be present here!&rdquo; thought the family priest to himself. He entered the park, and espied the young man; and then removing the cloth from his feet he examined the marks upon them. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he is destined to be king of all Jambudīpa, let alone Benares!&rdquo; and he ordered all the gongs and cymbals to strike up.</p>
<p class="p7">Banyan awaking threw the cloth from his face, and saw a crowd assembled round him! He turned round and for a moment or two he lay still; then arose, and sat with his legs crossed. The family priest fell upon one knee, saying: &ldquo;Divine being, the kingdom is thine!&rdquo; &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said the youth; the family priest placed him upon the heap of precious jewels, and sprinkled him to be king.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a10240"></a>Thus made king, he gave the post of commander-in-chief to his friend Branch, and entered the city in great pomp; and Pottika<a id="a10241"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15827"><span class="t9">{756}</span></a> went with them.</p>
<p class="p7">From that day onward the Great Being ruled righteously in Benares.</p>
<p class="p7">One day the memory of his parents came into his mind; and addressing Branch, he said: &ldquo;Sir, it is impossible to live without father and mother; take a large company of people, and go fetch them.&rdquo; But Branch refused, &ldquo;That is not my business,&rdquo; said he. Then he told Pottika to do it. Pottika agreed, and making his way to Banyan&rsquo;s parents, told them that their son had become a king, and begged them to come to him. But they declined, saying that they had power and wealth; enough of that, they would not go. He asked Branch&rsquo;s parents also to come, and they too preferred to stay; and when he invited his own, they said: &ldquo;We live by tailoring; enough, enough,&rdquo; and refused like the rest.</p>
<p class="p7">As he didn&rsquo;t fulfil his desire, he then returned to Benares. Thinking that he would rest from the fatigue of the journey in the house of the commander-in-chief, before seeing Banyan, he went to that house. <span class="t18">[4.26] {4.41}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Tell the commander-in-chief,&rdquo; said he to the door-keeper, &ldquo;that his comrade Pottika is here.&rdquo; The man did so. But Branch had conceived a grudge against him, because, said he, the man had given his comrade Banyan the kingdom instead of himself; so on hearing this message, he waxed angry. &ldquo;Comrade indeed! Who is his comrade? A mad baseborn churl! Seize him!&rdquo; So they beat him and kicked him, and belaboured him with foot, knee and elbow, then clutching him by the throat cast him forth.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Branch,&rdquo; thought the man, &ldquo;gained the post of commander-in-chief through me, and now he is ungrateful, and malicious, and has beaten me, and cast me forth. But Banyan is a wise man, grateful and good, and to him I will go.&rdquo; So to the king&rsquo;s door he went, and sent a message to the king, that Pottika his comrade was waiting at the door. The king asked him in, and as he saw him approach, rose up from his seat, and went forth to meet him, and greeted him with affection; he caused him to be shaved and cared for, and adorned with all manner of ornaments, then gave him rich meats of every sort to eat; and this done, sat graciously with him, and enquired after his parents, who as the other informed him, refused to come.</p>
<p class="p7">Now Branch thought to himself, &ldquo;Pottika will be slandering me in the king&rsquo;s ear, but if I am by, he will not be able to speak,&rdquo; so he also repaired there. And Pottika, even in his presence, spoke to the king saying: &ldquo;My lord, when I was weary with my journey, I went to Branch&rsquo;s house, hoping to rest there first and then to visit you. But Branch said, &lsquo;I know him not!&rsquo; and evilly treated me, and haled me forth by the neck! Could you believe it!&rdquo; and with these words, he uttered three verses of verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10242"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo; &lsquo;Who is the man? I know him not! And the man&rsquo;s father, who?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who is the man?&rsquo; so Sākha said: &lsquo;Nigrodha, what think you?&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Then Sākha&rsquo;s men at Sākha&rsquo;s word dealt buffets on my face,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And seizing me about the throat cast me forth from the place.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. That such a deed in treachery an evil man should do!</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">An ingrate is a shame, O king &ndash; and he your comrade, too!&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {4.42}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing these, Banyan recited four verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;I know not, nor have ever heard in speech from any one,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Any such ill as this you tell which Sākha now has done.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. With me and Sākha you have lived; we both your comrades were;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of dominion among mankind you gave us each a share:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By you we got Supernormal Powers, and not a doubt is there.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. As when a seed in fire is cast, it burns, and cannot grow;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Do a good turn to evil men, it perishes even so.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. The grateful, good, and virtuous, such men are not as they;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In good soil seeds, in good men deeds, are never thrown away.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[4.27]</span></p>
<p class="p6">As Banyan was reciting these lines, Branch stood still where he was. Then the king asked him, &ldquo;Well, Branch, do you recognise this man Pottika?&rdquo; He was dumb. And the king laid his bidding upon the man in the words of the eighth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Seize on this worthless traitor here, whose thoughts so evil be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Spear him! For I would have him die &ndash; his life is nought to me!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But Pottika, on hearing this, thought within himself, &ldquo;Let not this fool die for my sake!&rdquo; and uttered the ninth verse: <span class="t18">{4.43}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;Great king, have mercy! Life once gone is hard to bring again:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">My lord forgive, and let him live! I wish the churl no pain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the king heard this, he forgave Branch; and he wished to bestow the place of commander-in-chief upon Pottika, but he would not take it. Then the king gave him the post of Treasurer, and with it went the judgeship of all the merchant guilds. Before that no such office had existed, but there was this office ever after. And by and by Pottika the Royal Treasurer, being blessed with sons and with daughters, uttered the last verse for their admonition:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a10243"></a><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;With Nigrodha one should dwell;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To wait on Sākha is not well.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Better with Nigrodha death</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Than with Sākha to draw breath.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">This discourse ended, the Teacher said: &ldquo;So, monks, you see that Devadatta was ungrateful before,&rdquo; and then identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time, Devadatta was Sākha, Ānanda was Pottika, and I myself was Nigrodha.&rdquo;</span></p>
