<p class="p7"><a id="a12681"></a><span class="t15">In the present one monk will not eat without sharing his food first. The Buddha tells a story of how a miser was converted, and eventually gives away his fortune, and becomes an ascetic. He is then asked to judge who is the best of the four daughters of Sakka.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;No huckster I.&rdquo;</span><a id="a12689"></a><span class="t30"> This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, concerning a liberal minded monk. He was said to be a man of gentle birth, living at Sāvatthi, who after hearing the Dhamma preached by the Teacher was converted and adopted the ascetic life. Being perfected in the moral virtues and furnished with the ascetic precepts</span><a id="a12690"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16991"><span class="t9">{1318}</span></a><a id="a12691"></a><span class="t30"> and with a heart full of love for his fellow monastics he thrice every day zealously ministered to the service of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, and showed himself exemplary in conduct </span><span class="t18">[5.203] </span><a id="a12692"></a><span class="t30">and devoted to generosity. Fulfilling the obligations of kindly civility,</span><a id="a12693"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16993"><span class="t9">{1319}</span></a><span class="t30"> whatever he received, so long as there were any recipients, he would give away till he was himself without food. And his liberality and charitable disposition were noised abroad in the Saṅgha of monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12694"></a><span class="t30">So one day the topic was started in the Dhamma Hall, how that a certain monk was so liberal minded and devoted to generosity that if he received only sufficient drink to fill the hollow of the hand, free from all greed, he would give it to his fellow monastics &ndash; his will being even as that of a Bodhisatta.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher by his divine sense of hearing caught what they were saying, and issuing forth from his Perfumed Chamber, drew nigh and asked what was the nature of their discussion. And when they answered, &ldquo;It was so and so,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;This monk of old, monks, was far from liberal, nay, so stingy that he would not give so much as a drop of oil on the tip of a blade of grass. So I converted and made him self-denying and by praising the fruits of generosity I firmly established him in almsgiving; so that on receiving water just enough to fill the hollow of the hand he would say, &ldquo;I will not drink a drop without giving some away,&rdquo; and he received a boon at my hands, and as a result of his almsgiving he became liberal minded and devoted to generosity,&rdquo; and with these words he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12695"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was king of Benares there lived a wealthy householder possessed of eighty crores and the king conferred on him the office of Treasurer. Being thus honoured by the king and highly esteemed by citizens and country folk alike, he was one day dwelling upon his worldly prosperity, and he thought: &ldquo;This glory was not won by me by slothfulness and sinful acts in a former existence <span class="t18">{5.383}</span> but was attained by accomplishing deeds of virtue; it behoves me to make my safety sure in the future.&rdquo; So he sought the king&rsquo;s presence and addressed him thus, &ldquo;In my house, sire, is treasure amounting to eighty crores: accept it from me.&rdquo; And when the king said: &ldquo;I have no need of your riches; I have abundant wealth: henceforth take and do whatever you like with it,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Can I, sire, bestow my money in generosity?&rdquo; The king said: &ldquo;Do as you please,&rdquo; and he had six alms halls built, one at each of the four city gates, one in the heart of the city and one at the door of his dwelling-house, and by a daily expenditure of six hundred thousand pieces of money he set on foot almsgiving on a grand scale, and so long as he lived he dispensed alms and instructed his sons, saying: &ldquo;See that you do not break away from this tradition of mine, of giving alms,&rdquo; and at the close of his life he was reborn as Sakka.</p>
<p class="p7">His son, in like manner giving alms, was reborn as Canda, Canda&rsquo;s son as Suriya, Suriya&rsquo;s son as Mātali, Mātali&rsquo;s son as Pañcasikha. Now Pañcasikha&rsquo;s son, the sixth in descent, was the Treasurer was named Maccharikosiya (the Miser Kosiya) and he still owned eighty crores. But he thought: &ldquo;My forefathers were fools. They flung away the wealth that was so sorely scraped together, but I will guard my treasure. I will not give a penny to a soul.&rdquo; And he demolished and burned down the alms-hall and became a confirmed miser. So the beggars assembled at his gate and stretching forth their arms cried with a loud voice, &ldquo;O Lord High Treasurer, do not away with <span class="t18">[5.204] </span>the tradition of your forefathers, but give alms.&rdquo; On hearing this the people blamed him, saying: &ldquo;Maccharikosiya has done away with the tradition of his family.&rdquo; Being ashamed he set a watch to prevent the beggars from standing at his gate, and being thus left utterly destitute they never again set eyes upon his door.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12696"></a>Thenceforth he continued to accumulate money,<a id="a12697"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16995"><span class="t9">{1320}</span></a> but he neither enjoyed it himself nor shared it with his wife and children. He lived on rice with red powder, served with sour gruel, and wore coarse garments, being merely the filaments of roots and stalks of berries, shading his head with a parasol of leaves, and he rode upon a crazy old chariot, yoked to worn-out oxen. Thus all this wicked fellow&rsquo;s money <span class="t18">{5.384}</span><a id="a12698"></a> was as it were a coconut found by a dog.<a id="a12699"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16997"><span class="t9">{1321}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12700"></a>Now one day when he was going to wait upon the king he thought he would take the sub-treasurer<a id="a12701"></a><a href="notes2.html#a16999"><span class="t9">{1322}</span></a><a id="a12702"></a> with him, and at the moment when he reached his house he found the sub-treasurer seated in the midst of his wife and children, and eating some rice porridge prepared with powdered sugar to sweeten it<a id="a12703"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17001"><span class="t9">{1323}</span></a> and cooked with fresh ghee. On seeing Maccharikosiya he rose from his seat and said: &ldquo;Come and sit on this couch, Lord High Treasurer, and have some rice porridge with me.&rdquo; When he saw the rice porridge, his mouth watered and he longed to partake of it, but the thought occurred to him, &ldquo;If I should take some porridge, when the sub-treasurer comes to my house I shall have to make him some return of hospitality and in this way my money will be wasted. I will not eat it.&rdquo; Then on being pressed again and again he refused, saying: &ldquo;I have already dined; I am sated.&rdquo; But while the sub-treasurer was enjoying his food, he sat looking on with his mouth watering, and when the meal was ended he repaired with him to the palace.</p>
<p class="p7">On returning home he was overwhelmed with a craving for rice porridge, but thought: &ldquo;If I should say I want to eat rice porridge, a lot of people would also want to eat it and a quantity of husked rice and the like would be wasted. I will not say a word to a creature.&rdquo; So night and day he passed his time thinking of nothing but porridge, but from fear of spending his money he told no one and kept his craving to himself. But being unable to bear with it he gradually grew paler and paler, and so through fear of wasting his substance he spoke of his craving to no one, and by and by becoming very weak he lay down, hugging his bed. Then his wife came to see him and stroking his back with her hand she inquired, &ldquo;Is my lord ill?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ill yourself!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I am quite well.&rdquo; &ldquo;My <span class="t18">[5.205] </span>lord, you have grown pale. Have you anything on your mind? Is the king displeased or have you been treated with disrespect by your children? Or have you conceived a craving for something?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I have a craving.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell me what it is, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can you keep a secret?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I will be silent about any cravings that ought to be kept secret.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{5.385}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12704"></a>But even so, through fear of wasting his substance he had not the courage to tell her, but eventually being repeatedly pressed by her he said: &ldquo;My dear, one day I saw the sub-treasurer eating rice porridge prepared with ghee, honey, and powdered sugar, and from that day I have had a craving to eat the same kind of porridge.&rdquo; &ldquo;Poor wretch, are you so badly off? I will cook porridge enough for all the inhabitants of Benares.&rdquo; Then he felt just as if he had been struck on the head with a stick. Being angry with her he said: &ldquo;I am well aware that you are very rich. If it comes from your family, you may cook and give rice porridge to the whole city.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then I will make and cook enough for the dwellers in a single street.&rdquo; &ldquo;What have you to do with them? Let them eat what belongs to them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I will make enough for seven households taken at random here and there.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are they to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I will cook it for the attendants in this house.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are they to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, then, I will cook for our kinsfolk only.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are they to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Then I will cook, my lord, for you and me.&rdquo; &ldquo;And pray who are you? It is not allowable in your case.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will cook it for you only, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pray do not cook it for me: if you cook it in the house, a lot of people will look for it. But just give me a measure of husked rice, a quartern of milk, a pound<a id="a12705"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17003"><span class="t9">{1324}</span></a> of sugar, a pot of honey and a cooking vessel, and going into the forest I will there cook and eat my porridge.&rdquo; She did so, and bidding a slave take it all he ordered him to go and stand in such and such a place. Then sending the slave forward, all alone he made himself a veil and in this disguise he went there and by the river side at the foot of a shrub he had an oven made and firewood and water brought to him and he said to the slave, &ldquo;Go and stand in yonder road and, if you see anyone, make a sign to me, and when I call you come back to me.&rdquo; Sending off the slave he made a fire and cooked his porridge.</p>
<p class="p7">At that moment Sakka, king of heaven, contemplating the splendid city of the gods, ten thousand leagues in extent, <span class="t18">{5.386}</span><a id="a12706"></a> and the golden street sixty leagues long, and Vejayanta<a id="a12707"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17005"><span class="t9">{1325}</span></a><a id="a12708"></a> reared a thousand leagues high, and Sudhammā<a id="a12709"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17007"><span class="t9">{1326}</span></a> compassing five hundred leagues, and his throne of yellow marble, sixty leagues in extent, and his white umbrella with its golden wreath, five leagues in circumference, and his own person accompanied with a glorious array of <span class="t18">[5.206] </span><a id="a12710"></a>twenty-five millions of Devaccharas &ndash; contemplating, I say, all this glory of his he thought: &ldquo;What can I have done to have attained to such honour as this?&rdquo; And he saw in his mind&rsquo;s eye the almsgiving he had established when he was Lord High Treasurer at Benares, and then he thought: &ldquo;Where are my descendants born?&rdquo; and considering the matter he said: &ldquo;My son Canda was born in a Devaputta form, and his son was Suriya.&rdquo; And marking the birth of all of them, &ldquo;What,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;has been the fate of the son of Pañcasikha?&rdquo; And on reflection he saw that the tradition of the race had been done away with, and the thought occurred to him, &ldquo;This wicked fellow being stingy neither enjoys his wealth himself nor gives anything to others: the tradition of the race has been destroyed by him. When he dies he will be reborn in hell. By admonishing him and by re-establishing my tradition I will show him how to be reborn in the city of the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So he summoned Canda and the rest and saying: &ldquo;Come, we will visit the haunts of men: the tradition of our family has been abolished by Maccharikosiya, the alms halls have been burned down and he neither enjoys wealth himself nor gives anything to others, but now being desirous of eating porridge and thinking: &ldquo;If it is cooked in the house, the porridge will have to be given to someone else as well,&rdquo; he has gone into the forest and is cooking it all alone. We will go and convert him and teach him the fruits of almsgiving. If however he were asked by all of us at once to give us some food, he would fall dead on the spot. I will go first and when I have asked him for porridge and have taken my seat, then do you come, one after another, disguised as brahmins, and beg of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So saying he himself in the likeness of a brahmin approached him and cried, &ldquo;Ho! Which is the road to Benares?&rdquo; Then Maccharikosiya said: &ldquo;Have you lost your wits? Do you not even know the way to Benares? Why are you coming this way? Get you gone from hence.&rdquo; Sakka, pretending not to hear what he said, came close up to him, asking him what he said. <span class="t18">{5.387}</span><a id="a12711"></a> Then he bawled, &ldquo;I say, you deaf old brahmin, why are you coming this way? Go yonder.&rdquo; Then Sakka said: &ldquo;Why do you bawl so loud? Here I see smoke and a fire, and rice porridge is cooking. It must be some occasion for entertaining brahmins. I too when the brahmins are being fed will take somewhat. Why are you driving me away?&rdquo;<a id="a12712"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17009"><span class="t9">{1327}</span></a> &ldquo;There is no entertainment of brahmins here. Be off with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then why are you so angry? When you eat your meal, I will take a little.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I will not give you even a single lump of boiled rice. This scanty food is only just enough to keep me alive, and even this was got by begging. You go and look for your food elsewhere,&rdquo; and this he said in reference to the fact of his having asked his wife for the rice &ndash; and he spoke this verse: <span class="t18">[5.207]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;No huckster I to buy or vend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No stores are mine to give or lend:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This dole of rice &rsquo;twas hard to gain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis scarce enough to serve us twain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this Sakka said: &ldquo;I too with honey-sweet voice will repeat a verse for you; hearken to me,&rdquo; and though he tried to stop him, saying: &ldquo;I do not want to hear your verse,&rdquo; Sakka repeated a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;From little one should little give, from moderate means likewise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">From much give much, of giving nought no question can arise.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12713"></a><span class="t12">3. This then I tell you, Kosiya, give alms from what is thine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eat not alone, no bliss is his that by himself shall dine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By generosity you may ascend the noble path divine.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.388}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing his words he said: &ldquo;This is a gracious saying of thine, brahmin; when the porridge is cooked, you shall receive a little. Pray, take a seat.&rdquo; Sakka sat down on one side. When he was seated, Canda in like manner drew nigh and starting a conversation in the same way, though Maccharikosiya kept trying to stop him, he spoke a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Vain is your sacrifice and vain the craving of your heart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should you eat food and grudge to give your guest some little part.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12714"></a><span class="t12">5. This then I tell you, Kosiya, give alms from what is thine:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eat not alone, no bliss is his that by himself shall dine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By generosity you may ascend the noble path divine.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing his words, the miser very reluctantly said: &ldquo;Well, sit down, and you shall have a little porridge.&rdquo; So he went and sat down near Sakka. Then Suriya in like manner drew nigh and starting a conversation in the same way, though the miser tried to stop him, he spoke a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Real your sacrifice nor vain the craving of your heart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Should you not eat your food alone, but give your guest a part.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. This then I tell you, Kosiya, give alms from what is thine:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eat not alone, no bliss is his that by himself shall dine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By generosity you may ascend the noble path divine.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing his words the miser with great reluctance said: &ldquo;Well, sit down, and you shall have a little.&rdquo; So Suriya went and sat by Canda. Then Mātali in like manner drew nigh and starting a conversation, and though the miser tried to stop him, he spoke these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;Who offers gifts to lake or flood of Gayā&rsquo;s stream that laves</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or Timbaru or Doṇa shrine with rapid-flowing waves,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. Herein gains fruit of sacrifice and craving of his heart,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If with a guest he shares his food nor sits and eats apart.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. This then I tell you, Kosiya, give alms from what is thine:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eat not alone, no bliss is his that by himself shall dine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By generosity you may ascend the noble path divine.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.389}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing his words also, overwhelmed as it were with a mountain peak, he reluctantly said: &ldquo;Well, sit down, and you shall have a little.&rdquo; Mātali came and sat by Suriya. Then Pañcasikha in like manner drew nigh and starting a conversation, though the miser tried to stop him, spoke a couple of verses: <span class="t18">[5.208]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">11. &ldquo;Like fish that swallows greedily hook fastened to a line</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is he who with a guest at hand all by himself shall dine.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">12. This then I tell you, Kosiya, give alms from what is thine:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eat not alone, no bliss is his that by himself shall dine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By generosity you may ascend the noble path divine.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Maccharikosiya on hearing this, with a painful effort and groaning aloud, said: &ldquo;Well, sit down, and you shall have a little.&rdquo; So Pañcasikha went and sat by Mātali. And when these five brahmins had just taken their seats, the porridge was cooked. Then Kosiya taking it from the oven told the brahmins to bring their leaves. Remaining seated as they were they stretched forth their hands and brought leaves of a creeper from the Himālayas. Kosiya on seeing them said: &ldquo;I cannot give you any porridge in these large leaves of yours: get some leaves of the acacia and similar trees.&rdquo; They gathered such leaves and each one was as big as a warrior&rsquo;s shield. So he helped all of them to some porridge with a spoon. By the time he had helped the last of all, there was still plenty left in the pot. After serving the five brahmins he himself sat down, holding the pot.<a id="a12715"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17012"><span class="t9">{1328}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7">At that moment Pañcasikha rose up and putting off his natural form was changed into a dog and came and stood in front of them and made water. Each of the brahmins covered up his porridge with a leaf. A drop of the dog&rsquo;s water fell on the back of Kosiya&rsquo;s hand. <span class="t18">{5.390}</span><a id="a12716"></a> The brahmins fetched water in their jars and mixing it with the porridge pretended to eat it. Kosiya said: &ldquo;Give me too some water and after washing my hand I will take some food.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fetch water for yourself,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and wash your hand.&rdquo; &ldquo;I gave you porridge; give me a little water.&rdquo; &ldquo;We do not make a business of exchanging alms.&rdquo;<a id="a12717"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17014"><span class="t9">{1329}</span></a> &ldquo;Well then guard this cooking pot and, after I have washed my hand, I will come back,&rdquo; and he descended to the river side. At that moment the dog filled the pot with urine. Kosiya on seeing him make water took a big stick and drew nigh, threatening him. The dog was now transformed into a spirited blood horse and, as it pursued him, it assumed various colours. Now it was black, now white, now gold-coloured, now dappled. At one time high, at another time low of stature. Thus in many different appearances it pursued Maccharikosiya, who frightened with the fear of death drew near to the brahmins, while they flew up and stood fixed in the air. On seeing their Supernormal Powers he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">13. &ldquo;You noble brahmins, standing in mid air,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why does this hound of yours thus strangely wear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A thousand varied forms, though one he be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And tell me truly, brahmins, who are ye?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, Sakka, the king of heaven, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">14. &ldquo;Canda and Suriya lo! both are here,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Mātali the heavenly charioteer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I Sakka am, chief god of Thirty-Three,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And Pañcasikha there is chasing ye.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.209]</span></p>
<p class="p6">And celebrating Pañcasikha&rsquo;s fame Sakka spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">15. &ldquo;With tabour, drum, and tambourine they rouse him from his sleep,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And as he wakes, glad music makes his heart with joy to leap.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing his words Kosiya asked, &ldquo;By what acts do men attain to heavenly glory such as this&rsquo;?&rdquo; &ldquo;They that do not practise generosity, evil doers and misers reach not the Deva world, but are reborn in hell.&rdquo; And by way of showing this Sakka said: <span class="t18">{5.391}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">16. &ldquo;Whoe&rsquo;er are miserly niggards born,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or monks and holy brahmins scorn,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their earthly frame now laid aside,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In hell, dissolved by death, abide.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And speaking the following verse, to show how those that are steadfast in righteousness attain to the Deva world, he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">17. &ldquo;Steadfast in right who heaven would win</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Give alms and keep themselves from sin,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And, with their body laid aside</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By death&rsquo;s decay, in heaven abide.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After these words Sakka said: &ldquo;Kosiya, we have not come to you for the sake of the porridge, but from a feeling of pity and compassion for you are we come,&rdquo; and to make it clear to him he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">18. &ldquo;You, though to us in former births akin,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12718"></a><span class="t12">A miser are, a man of wrath and sin;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis for your sake we have come down to earth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To avert from you sin&rsquo;s doom &ndash; in hell rebirth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this Kosiya thought: &ldquo;They tell me they are my well-wishers; plucking me out of hell they would fain establish me in heaven.&rdquo; And being highly pleased he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">19. &ldquo;In that you thus admonish me, you doubtless seek my good,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I too will follow your advice, so far as understood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">20. Henceforth I&rsquo;ll cease from stingy ways, from wrongful deed abstain, </span><span class="t18">{5.392}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12719"></a><span class="t12">Give alms of all, nor e&rsquo;en a cup, unshared,</span><a id="a12720"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17016"><span class="t19">{1330}</span></a><span class="t12"> of water drain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">21. Thus ever giving, Sakka, soon my wealth will minished be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12721"></a><span class="t12">Then will I orders take, and sensual desires of every kind</span><a id="a12722"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17018"><span class="t19">{1331}</span></a><span class="t12"> will flee.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sakka after converting Maccharikosiya taught him the fruits of alms-giving and made him self-denying, and when by preaching the Dhamma he had established him in the five moral virtues, together with his attendant gods he returned to the Deva city. Maccharikosiya too went into the city of Benares and having asked the king&rsquo;s permission he bade them take and fill all the vessels they could lay hands on with his treasure and gave it to the beggars. And now he started from the Himālayas upon the right-hand side and on a spot between the Ganges and a natural lake he built a hut of leaves and becoming an ascetic he lived on roots and wild berries.<span class="t18"> [5.210]</span> There he dwelt a long time till he reached old age.</p>
<p class="p7">At that time Sakka had four daughters, Hope [Āsā], Faith [Saddhā], Glory [Sirī], and Honour [Hirī], who taking with them many a heavenly scented garland came to Lake Anotatta, to disport themselves in the water, and after amusing themselves there seated themselves on mount Manosilā. Just at that moment Nārada, a brahmin ascetic, went to the palace of the Thirty-Three to rest during the heat of the day and constructed a dwelling-place for the day in the bowers of Cittakūṭa in the Nanda grove. And holding in his hand the flower of the coral tree, to serve as a sunshade, he repaired to Golden Cave, the place where he dwelt on the top of Manosilā. The nymphs on seeing this flower in his hand begged it from him.<span class="t18"> {5.393}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to make the matter clear, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">22. &ldquo;In Gandhamādana&rsquo;s lordly height,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">These nymphs, great Sakka&rsquo;s care, delight;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To them a saint of world-wide fame</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With goodly bough in hand there came.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">23. This bough with flowers so pure and sweet</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is deemed for immortals meet:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No Dānava, none of mortal birth</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Can claim this flower of priceless worth.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">24. Then Faith, Hope, Glory, Honour, those</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Four maids with skins like gold, arose,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And, peerless &rsquo;midst all nymphs confessed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The brahmin Nārada addressed,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">25. Give us, O sage, this coral flower,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If still to give is in your power,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As Sakka&rsquo;s self we&rsquo;ll honour thee,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And you in all things blessed shall be.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">26. When Nārada their prayer had heard,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He straight a mighty quarrel stirred:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I need it not; whom you allow</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To be your queen shall claim the bough.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.394}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The four nymphs on hearing what he said spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">27. &ldquo;O Nārada, supreme are you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On whom you will the boon bestow:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whom you shall with such gift invest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Amongst us shall be counted best.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Nārada, on hearing their words, addressing them said:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12723"></a><span class="t12">28. &ldquo;Fair one,</span><a id="a12724"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17020"><span class="t19">{1332}</span></a><span class="t12"> such counsel is not right;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What brahmin strife would dare excite?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Take to lord of Bhūtas your quest,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you would know who&rsquo;s worst or best.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Teacher spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">29. &ldquo;With pride of beauty mad and rage</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Excited by the cunning sage, </span><span class="t18">[5.211]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To Sakka, lord of gods, they go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who &rsquo;mongst them all is best to know.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.395}</span></p>
<p class="p6">As they stood asking this question,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">30. &ldquo;These Devas so earnest in their quest</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sakka with due respect addressed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You all in beauty equal are,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who thus with strife your peace would mar?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Being thus addressed by him they said:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12725"></a><span class="t12">31. &ldquo;Nārada, world-traversing, a sage of might,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Truth-piercing, steadfast ever in the right,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thus spake to us on Gandhamādana&rsquo;s height;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To Sakka, King of Devas, straightway go,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If who is first or last you fain would know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this Sakka thought: &ldquo;If I shall say that one of these four daughters of mine is virtuous beyond the others, the rest will be angry. This is a case impossible for me to decide; I will send them to Kosiya, the ascetic in the Himālayas: he shall decide the question for them.&rdquo; So he said: &ldquo;I cannot decide your case. In the Himālayas is an ascetic called Kosiya: to him I will send a cup of my ambrosia. He eats nothing without sharing it with another, and in giving he shows discrimination by bestowing it upon the virtuous. Whichsoever of you shall receive food at his hand, she must be the best amongst you.&rdquo; And so saying he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">32. &ldquo;The sage that dwells in that vast wood</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Will not unshared touch any food;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kosiya with judgment gifts confers,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To whom he gives, first place is hers.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.396}</span></p>
<p class="p6">So he summoned Mātali and sent him to the ascetic, and in sending him he repeated the following verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">33. &ldquo;On Himavat slopes where Ganges glides</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Towards the south a saint resides:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ambrosia, Mātali, take to the saint,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For food and drink he&rsquo;s waxing faint.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">34. &ldquo;At Deva&rsquo;s behest went Mātali,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On a car with a thousand steeds rode he;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Unseen he soon by the hermitage stood</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And offered the sage ambrosial food.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Kosiya took it and even as he stood spoke a couple of verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12726"></a><span class="t12">35. &ldquo;A flame of sacrifice while I did raise,</span><a id="a12727"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17022"><span class="t19">{1333}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The sun that drives away all gloom to praise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sakka supreme o&rsquo;er spirit-world that stands &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who else? Ambrosia placed within my hands. </span><span class="t18">[5.212]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">36. White like a pearl was it, beyond compare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fragrant and pure, and marvellously fair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Never before seen by these eyes of mine;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What god puts in my hands this food divine?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Mātali said:<span class="t18"> {5.397}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">37. &ldquo;I come, O mighty sage, by Sakka sent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In haste to bring you heavenly nutriment:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This best of food, pray, eat without all fear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You seest here Mātali, heaven&rsquo;s charioteer.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">38. By eating this twelve evil things are slain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Thirst, hunger, discontent, fatigue, and pain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cold, heat, rage, enmity, strife, slander, sloth &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This heavenly essence eat you, nothing loth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this Kosiya, to make it clear that he had taken a vow upon him, spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">39. &ldquo; &rsquo;Twas wrong to eat alone I thought, so took a vow one day</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To touch no food, unless I gave some part of it away.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To eat alone is ne&rsquo;er approved by men of noble mind,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whoso with others does not share no happiness may find.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And when Mātali questioned him, saying: &ldquo;Venerable sir, what did you discover was wrong in eating without giving a portion to others that you took this vow upon you?&rdquo; he answered:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">40. &ldquo;All who commit adultery or womankind do slay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who holy men curse and revile or friendly souls betray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And misers, worst of all &ndash; that I may ne&rsquo;er be ranked with such,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Not e&rsquo;en a drop of water I unshared will ever touch. </span><span class="t18">{5.398}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">41. On men and women both alike my gifts shall ever flow,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sages will praise all such as shall their goods in alms bestow;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All that are generous in this world and niggard ways eschew,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Approved by all, will ever be esteemed good men and true.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12728"></a>On hearing this Mātali stood before him in a visible form. At that moment these four Devakaññās stood at the four points of the compass. Glory at the east, Hope at the south, Faith at the west, Honour at the north.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to clear up the matter, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">42. &ldquo;Four nymphs with golden forms so bright,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hope, Glory, Faith, and Honour hight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At Sakka&rsquo;s bidding earthward sent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To Kosiya&rsquo;s cell their footsteps bent.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">43. The maids with forms that glowed like flame</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To each of earth&rsquo;s four quarters came;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Fore Mātali (now god confessed)</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The sage o&rsquo;erjoyed one thus addressed,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">44. Who are you, nymph, like morning star,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Illuming Eastern skies afar? </span><span class="t18">[5.213]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12729"></a><span class="t12">Your form in robe</span><a id="a12730"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17024"><span class="t19">{1334}</span></a><span class="t12"> of gold arrayed</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell me your name, O heavenly maid. </span><span class="t18">{5.399}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">45. I Glory am, man&rsquo;s honoured friend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The sinless soul prompt to defend:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To claim this food, lo! here am I;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With this my prayer, great sage, comply.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">46. I bliss confer on whom I will</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And all his heart&rsquo;s desire fulfil;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">High priest, my name is Glory, know,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">On me your heavenly food bestow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this Kosiya said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">47. &ldquo;Men may be skilful, virtuous, wise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Excel in all their wits devise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet without you they ne&rsquo;er succeed;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In this I blame your evil deed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">48. Another slothful, greedy, see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Low-born and ugly as may be:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Blessed by your care and rich withal</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He makes one nobly born his thrall.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">49. You then as false and dull, Glory, I recognise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Reckless in courting fools and laying low the wise;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No claim have you in truth to seat or waterpot,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Much less ambrosial food. Begone, I like you not.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.400}</span></p>
<p class="p6">So did she straightaway vanish from sight. Then holding converse with Hope he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">50. &ldquo;Who are you, maiden fair, with teeth so pure and white,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With rings of burnished gold and spangled bracelets dight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In robe of watered sheen and wearing on your head</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A sprig like ruddy flame by tufts of kusa fed?</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">51. Like a wild doe all but by hunter&rsquo;s arrow grazed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You look dull-eyed around as &rsquo;twere some creature dazed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O softly-glancing maid, what comrade have you here,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That through lone forest glade you stray without a fear?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then she spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">52. &ldquo;No comrade have I here; from Sakka&rsquo;s heavenly home</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Masakkasāra called, Devatā-born I come:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To claim ambrosial food Hope now appears to you;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O hearken, noble sage, and grant this boon to me.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.401}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this Kosiya said: &ldquo;They tell me that whosoever pleases you, to him by accomplishing the fruition of hope you grant hope, and whosoever pleases you not, to him you grant it not. Success does not come to him through you in this case, but you bring about his destruction,&rdquo; and by way of illustration he said: <span class="t18">[5.214]</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">53. &ldquo;Merchants through hope seek treasure far and wide,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And taking ship on ocean&rsquo;s billows ride:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">There sometimes do they sink to rise no more,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Or else escaping their lost wealth deplore.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">54. In hope their fields the farmers plough and till,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sow seeds and labour with their utmost skill;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But should some plague, or drought afflict the soil</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No harvest will they reap for all their toil.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">55. Ease-loving men, led on by hope, take heart</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And for their lord&rsquo;s sake play a manly part,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Oppressed by foes on every side they fall</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And fighting for their lord lose life and all.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">56. Grain-stores and wealth renouncing for their kin,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Through hope aspiring heavenly bliss to win,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Long time harsh penances they undergo,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And by bad ways attain to state of woe.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">57. Deceiver of mankind, your suit is vain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your idle craving for this boon restrain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">No claim have you to seat or waterpot:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Much less to heavenly food. Begone, I like you not.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.402}</span></p>
<p class="p6">She too on being rejected straightaway vanished from sight. Then holding converse with Faith he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">58. &ldquo;Famed nymph in blaze of glory dressed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Standing towards the ill-omened West,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Your form in robe of gold arrayed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell me your name, illustrious maid.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then she repeated a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">59. &ldquo;My name is Faith, man&rsquo;s honoured friend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The sinless soul prompt to defend:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To claim this food, lo! here am I;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With this my prayer, great sage, comply.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then Kosiya said: &ldquo;Those mortals that in believing the words of first one and then another do this or that, do that which they ought not to do more often than that which they ought to do, and verily it is all done through you,&rdquo; and he repeated these verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">60. &ldquo;Through faith at times men freely alms dispense,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Show self-control, restraint and abstinence: </span><span class="t18">{5.403}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At times again through you from grace they fall,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Slander and lie and cheat and steal withal.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">61. With wives, chaste, faithful, and of high degree,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A man may circumspect and prudent be,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">May curb his passions well in such a case,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet in some harlot his whole trust may place.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">62. Through you, O Faith, adultery is rife,</span></p>

<p class="p6">She too straightaway vanished from sight. But Kosiya holding converse with Honour, as she stood on the north side, repeated these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">63. &ldquo;Like Dawn that gilds the skirts of hateful Night,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So does your beauty burst upon my sight; </span><span class="t18">{5.404}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">O </span><span class="t12">Accharā </span><span class="t12">in form so passing fair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tell me your name and who you are declare.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12733"></a><span class="t12">64. Like to a tender plant</span><a id="a12734"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17028"><span class="t19">{1336}</span></a><span class="t12"> whose roots are fed</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Its wealth of scarlet leaves by summer breezes shed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why do you look at me with bashful air,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Fain as it were to speak, yet standing silent there?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then she uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12737"></a><span class="t12">65. &ldquo;Honour am I, man&rsquo;s cherished friend,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who aid to righteous mortals lend;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lo here am I this food to claim,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet scarcely dare my wish to frame;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To woman suing counts as shame.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this the ascetic repeated two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">66. &ldquo;No need for you to beg and sue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Receive what is your right and due:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Accept the food you fain would have. </span><span class="t18">{5.405}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">67. Deign, nymph, all golden clad, I pray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">To feast within my cell this day:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">First honouring you with dainties rare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I too this heavenly food would share.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then follow some verses spoken after Fully Awakening:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">68. &ldquo;Thus Honour, glorious nymph, at his behest</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And thronging saints are in its precincts found.</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">72. On the north side, hemmed in by smooth and level bank,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="t12">74. There happy birds in peace enjoy abundant fare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Swans, herons, ospreys too, peacocks with plumage rare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cuckoos and pheasants eke with ruddy geese are there. </span><span class="t18">[5.216]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t52">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">75. Hither do lions, tigers, boars resort their thirst to slake.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This bears, hyenas, wolves are wont their drinking-place to make.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">76. The buffalo, rhinoceros and gayal too are here,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With antelope, elk, herds of swine, and red and other deer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And cats with ears like to a hare&rsquo;s in numbers vast appear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">77. The mountain slopes are gaily pranked with flowers of varied shade</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And echo to the song of birds that haunt each forest glade.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12743"></a>Thus did the Fortunate One sing the praises of Kosiya&rsquo;s hermitage. And now to show forth the manner of the Devī Honour&rsquo;s entrance therein he said: <span class="t18">{5.407}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">78. &ldquo;The fair one leaning on a branch, all clothed with foliage green,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like lightning front a thunder-cloud straight flashed upon the scene.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12744"></a><span class="t12">For her was set a dainty couch,</span><a id="a12745"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17036"><span class="t19">{1340}</span></a><span class="t12"> rich drapings at its head,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All wrought of fragrant kusa grass, with deer-skin overspread.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And thus to Honour, heavenly nymph, the holy ascetic spake:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For your delight the couch is set; be pleased a seat to take.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">79. The ascetic then pure water from the spring</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In freshly gathered leaves with haste did bring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And knowing what her inmost soul would crave</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The ambrosial food to her he gladly gave.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">80. As in her hands the welcome gift she pressed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The nymph thus overjoyed the saint addressed:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Worship to me and victory you have given,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Lo! Now once more I&rsquo;ll seek my native heaven.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">81. The maid intoxicate with pride of fame,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With Kosiya&rsquo;s blessing, back to Sakka came,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And see, she cried, god of the thousand eyes,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The ambrosia&rsquo;s here &ndash; to me award the prize.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">82. Then Sakka and his host of angels paid</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Due honour to the peerless heavenly maid,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And as she sat on her new seat enthroned,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Her presence gods and men adoring owned.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.408}</span></p>
<p class="p6">While thus honouring her this thought occurred to Sakka, &ldquo;What can be the reason why Kosiya refusing it to the others gave the ambrosia to this one alone?&rdquo; To ascertain the reason of this he again sent Mātali.</p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, in making the matter clear, repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">83. &ldquo;So Sakka, lord of the Thirty-Three,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Once more addressing Mātali,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Said, &lsquo;Go and bid the saint explain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why Honour should the ambrosia gain.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12746"></a>In obedience to his word Mātali, mounting the carriage called Vejayanta,<a id="a12747"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17038"><span class="t9">{1341}</span></a> departed there. <span class="t18">[5.217]</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, to explain the matter, said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">84. &ldquo;So Mātali then launched a car to voyage through the air,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With fittings all to match itself, in splendour wondrous fair,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Its pole of gold, gold well refined, and all its framework built</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">With ornament elaborate and overlaid with gilt.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">85. Peacocks in gold depicted were in numbers not a few,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Horses and cows and elephants, tigers and panthers too,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here antelopes and deer are seen as if prepared for fight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Here wrought in precious stones are jays and other birds in flight.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">86. To it they yoked a thousand royal steeds of golden hue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Each strong as youthful elephant, a splendid sight to view; </span><span class="t18">{5.409}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their breasts in golden network clad, with wreaths begarlanded,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12748"></a><span class="t12">With loosened trace,</span><a id="a12749"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17040"><span class="t19">{1342}</span></a><span class="t12"> at a mere word, swift as the wind they sped.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">87. As Mātali this lordly car ascended with a bound</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The firmament in all ten points re-echoed to the sound:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And as he journeyed through the air, he made the world to quake,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And sky and sea and earth with all its rocks and woods did shake.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">88. Right soon he gained the hermitage and wishing to declare</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Due reverence for the holy man he left one shoulder bare,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And speaking to this brahmin sage, a wise and learned man,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Well trained in holy lore, &rsquo;twas thus that Mātali began:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">89. &lsquo;Hear now, O Kosiya, the words of Sakka, heavenly king,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As to what he is fain to learn, this message, lo! I bring,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">While Hope and Faith and Glory&rsquo;s claims you will not recognise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pray, why should Honour at your hands alone receive the prize?&rsquo; &rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {5.410}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing his words the ascetic spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">90. &ldquo;Glory to me, O Mātali, appears a partial jade,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">While Faith, you charioteer of gods, proves an inconstant maid,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hope ever a deceiver loves its promise to betray,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Honour alone is established firm in holy virtue&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And now in praise of her virtue he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">91. &ldquo;Maidens that still within their homes live, ever guarded well,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Women now past their prime, and such as still with husbands dwell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In one and all should fleshly lust within their heart arise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At Honour&rsquo;s voice they check the thought and sinful passion dies.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">92. Where shafts and spears in battle&rsquo;s van are hurtling fast and free,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And in the rout when comrades fall or turn them round and flee,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">At Honour&rsquo;s voice they check their flight e&rsquo;en at the cost of life,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12750"></a><span class="t12">And panic-stricken as they were once more renew the strife.</span><a id="a12751"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17043"><span class="t19">{1343}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">93. Just as the shore will stem the rush of billows from the main,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So Honour too will oft the course of wicked folk restrain.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Then, Mātali, to Sakka quick return and make it clear,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That saints throughout the whole wide world all Honour&rsquo;s name revere.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[5.218] {5.411}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this Mātali repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">94. &ldquo;Who was it, Kosiya, that did suggest this view to you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12752"></a><span class="t12">Was it great Sakka, Brahmā, or Pajāpati</span><a id="a12753"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17045"><span class="t19">{1344}</span></a><span class="t12"> maybe?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">This Honour, mighty sage, be sure, to Sakka owes her birth,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And in the Deva world she ranks foremost of all in worth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12754"></a>While he was still speaking, at that very instant Kosiya became subject to rebirth. Then Mātali said to him, &ldquo;Kosiya, your aggregate of life<a id="a12755"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17047"><span class="t9">{1345}</span></a><a id="a12756"></a> is passing from you: your practice of generosity<a id="a12757"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17049"><span class="t9">{1346}</span></a> is ended. What have you to do with the world of men? We will now go to the Deva world,&rdquo; and being minded to conduct him there he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">95. &ldquo;Come now, O saint, and straightway mount the car so dear to me,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And let me lead you to the heaven where reign the Thirty-Three.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Sakka is longing sore for you, to Sakka&rsquo;s self akin,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Today your way to fellowship with Sakka you shall win.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12758"></a><a id="a12759"></a>While Mātali was yet still speaking, Kosiya passing away came into existence in the ranks of the Devaputtas without the intervention of parents<a id="a12760"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17051"><span class="t9">{1347}</span></a> and mounting up took his stand upon the celestial carriage. Then Mātali conducted him into the presence of Sakka. Sakka on seeing him was glad at heart and gave him his own daughter Honour to wife, as his chief consort, and conferred on him a boundless sovereignty.</p>
<p class="p7">On perceiving the state of things the Teacher said: &ldquo;It is the merit of some illustrious beings that is thus purified,&rdquo; and he repeated the final verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">96. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis thus the acts of holy men to happy issue lead,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And evermore abides the fruit of meritorious deed. </span><span class="t18">{5.412}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Whoso beheld the ambrosial food to Honour that was given,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Straight passed away to fellowship with Sakka, lord of heaven.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a12761"></a><span class="t30">The Teacher here ended his discourse with these words, &ldquo;Not only now, monks, but of old also I converted this stingy fellow who was a confirmed miser,&rdquo; and so saying he identified the Jātaka thus, &ldquo;At that time Uppalavaṇṇā was the nymph Honour, a monk of lordly generosity was Kosiya, Anuruddha was Pañcasikha, Ānanda was Mātali, Kassapa was Suriya, Moggallāna was Canda, Sāriputta was Nārada, and I myself was Sakka.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;This is the report and the fame thereof.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><a id="a12783"></a><a id="a12784"></a><span class="t18">[5.219] </span><a id="a12785"></a><span class="t30">This was a story told by the Teacher, while dwelling beside lake Kuṇāla, concerning five hundred monks who were overwhelmed with discontent. Here follows the story in due order. The Sākiya and Koliya tribes had the river Rohinī which flows between the cities of Kapilavatthu and Koliya confined by a single dam and by means of it cultivated their crops. In the month Jeṭṭhamūla [May-June] when the crops began to flag and droop, the labourers from amongst the dwellers of both cities assembled together. Then the people of Koliya said: &ldquo;Should this water be drawn off on both sides, it will not prove sufficient for both us and you. But our crops will thrive with a single watering; give us then the water.&rdquo; The people of Kapilavatthu said: &ldquo;When you have filled your garners with corn, we shall hardly have the courage to come with ruddy gold, emeralds and copper coins, and with baskets and sacks in our hands, to hang about your doors. Our crops too will thrive with a single watering; give us the water.&rdquo; &ldquo;We will not give it,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Neither will we,&rdquo; said the others.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">As words thus ran high, one of them rose up and struck another a blow, and he in turn struck a third and thus it was that what with interchanging of blows and spitefully touching on the origin of their princely families they increased the tumult. The Koliya labourers said: &ldquo;Be off with your people of Kapilavatthu, </span><span class="t18">{5.413}</span><a id="a12786"></a><span class="t30"> men who like dogs, jackals, and such like beasts, cohabited with their own sisters. What will their elephants and horses, their shields and spears avail against us?&rdquo; The Sākiya labourers replied, &ldquo;Nay, do you, wretched lepers,</span><a id="a12787"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17055"><span class="t9">{1349}</span></a><span class="t30"> be off with your children, destitute and ill-conditioned fellows, who like brute beasts had their dwelling in a hollow jujube tree (koli).</span><span class="t33"> </span><span class="t30">What shall their elephants and horses, their spears and shields avail against us?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So they went and told the councillors appointed to such services and they reported it to the princes of their tribes. Then the Sākiyas said: &ldquo;We will show them how strong and mighty are the men who cohabited with their sisters,&rdquo; and they sallied forth, ready for the fray. And the Koliyas said: &ldquo;We will show them how strong and mighty are they who dwelt in the hollow of a jujube tree,&rdquo; and they too sallied forth ready for the fight.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12788"></a><a id="a12789"></a><span class="t30">But other teachers tell the story thus, &ldquo;When the female slaves of the Sākiyas and Koliyas came to the river to fetch water, and throwing the coils of cloth that they carried on their heads upon the ground were seated and pleasantly conversing, a certain woman took another&rsquo;s cloth, thinking it was her own; and when owing to this a quarrel arose, each claiming the coil of cloth as hers, gradually the people of the two cities, the serfs and the labourers, the attendants, headmen, councillors and viceroys, all of them sallied forth ready for battle.&rdquo; But the former version being found in many commentaries and being plausible is to be accepted rather than this one.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now it was at eventide that they would be sallying forth, ready for the fray. At that time the Fortunate One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, and at dawn of day while contemplating the world he beheld them setting out to the fight, and on seeing them he wondered whether if he were to go there the quarrel would cease, and he made </span><span class="t18">[5.220] </span><a id="a12790"></a><a id="a12791"></a><a id="a12792"></a><span class="t30">up his mind and thought: &ldquo;I will go there and, to quell this feud, I will relate three Jātaka Stories, and after that the quarrelling will cease. Then after telling two Jātaka Stories, to illustrate the blessings of union, I will teach them the Attadaṇḍasutta [Snp 4.15] and after hearing my sermon the people of the two cities will each of them bring into my presence two hundred and fifty youths, and I shall admit them to the Saṅgha and there will be a huge gathering.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12793"></a><span class="t30">Thus after performing his toilet, he went his rounds in Sāvatthi for alms, and on his return, after taking his meal, at eventide he issued forth from his Perfumed Chamber and without saying a word to any man he took his bowl and robe and went by himself and sat cross-legged in the air between the two hosts. And seeing it was an occasion to startle them, to create darkness he sat there emitting dark-blue</span><a id="a12794"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17057"><span class="t9">{1350}</span></a><span class="t30"> rays from his hair. Then when their hearts were troubled he revealed himself and emitted the six-coloured rays.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The people of Kapilavatthu on seeing the Fortunate One thought: &ldquo;The Teacher, our noble kinsman, is come. Can he have seen the obligation laid upon us to fight?&rdquo; &ldquo;Now that the Teacher has come, it is impossible for us to discharge a weapon against the person of an enemy,&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{5.414}</span><span class="t30"> and they threw down their arms, saying: &ldquo;Let the Koliyas slay us or roast us alive.&rdquo; The Koliyas acted in exactly the same way. Then the Fortunate One alighted and seated himself on a magnificent Buddha throne, set in a charming spot on a bed of sand, and he shone with the incomparable glory of a Buddha. The kings too saluting the Fortunate One took their seats.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12795"></a><a id="a12796"></a><span class="t30">Then the Teacher, though he knew it right well, asked, &ldquo;Why are you come here, mighty kings?&rdquo; &ldquo;Venerable sir,&rdquo; they answered, &ldquo;we are come, neither to see this river, nor to disport ourselves, but to get up a fight.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is the quarrel about, sires?&rdquo; &ldquo;About the water.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is the water worth?&rdquo; &ldquo;Very little, venerable sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is the earth worth?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is of priceless value.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are warrior chiefs worth?&rdquo; &ldquo;They too are of priceless value.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why on account of some worthless water are you for destroying chiefs of high worth? Verily, there is no satisfaction in this quarrel, but owing to a feud, sir, between a certain Tree Devatā and a black lion a grudge was set up, which has reached down to this present aeon,&rdquo; and with these words he told them the Phandanajātaka [Ja 475].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, there stood outside the city a village of carpenters. In it was a brahmin carpenter, who gained his livelihood by bringing wood from the forest, and making carts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">At that time there was a great plassey tree in the region of the Himālayas. A black lion used to go and lie at its root when hunting for food. One day a wind smote the tree, and a dry branch fell, and came down upon his shoulder. The blow gave him pain, and in fear he speedily rose up, and sprang away; then turning, he looked on the path he came by, and seeing nothing, thought: &ldquo;There is no other lion or tiger, nor any in pursuit. Well, I think, the deity of that tree cannot deal with my lying there. I will find out if so it be.&rdquo; So thinking, he grew angry out of season, and struck the tree, and cried, &ldquo;Not a leaf on your tree did I eat, not a branch did I break; you can put up with other creatures abiding here, and you cannot put up with me! What is wrong with me? Wait a few days, and I will tear you out root and branch, I will get you chopped up chipmeal!&rdquo; Thus he upbraided the deity of the tree, and then away he went in search of a man.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">At that time the brahmin carpenter aforesaid with two or three other men, had come in a wagon to that neighbourhood to get wood for his trade as a cartwright. He left his wagon in a certain spot, and then adze and hatchet in hand went searching for trees. He happened to come near this plassey tree. The lion seeing him went and stood under the tree, for, he thought: &ldquo;Today I must see the back of my enemy!&rdquo; But the cartwright looking this way and that fled from the neighbourhood of the tree. &ldquo;I will speak to him before he gets quite away,&rdquo; thought the lion, and repeated the first verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">1. &ldquo;O man, who stand with axe in hand, within this woodland haunt,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Come tell me true, I ask of you, what tree is it you want?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">&ldquo;Lo, a miracle!&rdquo; said the man, on hearing this address, &ldquo;I swear, I never yet saw beast that could talk like a man. Of course he will know what kinds of wood are good for the cartwright. I&rsquo;ll ask him.&rdquo; Thus thinking, he repeated the second verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">2. &ldquo;Up hill, down dale, along the plain, a king you range the wood:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Come tell me true, I ask of you &ndash; what tree for wheels is good?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The lion listened, and said to himself, &ldquo;Now I shall gain my heart&rsquo;s desire!&rdquo; then he repeated the third verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">3. &ldquo;Not Sāl, acacia, not mare&rsquo;s-ear, much less a shrub is good;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">There is a tree they call plassey, and there&rsquo;s your best wheel-wood.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The man was pleased to hear this, and thought: &ldquo;A happy day it was brought me into the woodland. Here&rsquo;s a creature in the shape of a beast to tell me what wood is good for the wheelwright! Hey, but that&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; So he questioned the lion in the fourth verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">4. &ldquo;What is the fashion of the leaves, what sort the trunk to see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Come tell me true, I ask of you, that I may know that tree?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">In reply the lion repeated two verses:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">5. &ldquo;This is the tree whose branch you see droop, bend, but never break;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">This is the plassey, on whose roots my standing-place I take.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">6. For spoke or felloe, pole of car, or wheel, or any part,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">This plassey tree will do for you in making of a cart.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">After this declaration, the lion moved aside, joy in his heart. The cartwright began to fell the tree. Then the Tree Devatā thought: &ldquo;I never dropped anything on that beast; he fell in a rage out of season, and now he is for destroying my home, and I too shall be destroyed. I must find some way of destroying his majesty.&rdquo; So assuming the shape of a woodman, he came up to the cartwright, and said to him, &ldquo;Ho man! A fine tree you have there! What will you do with it when it is down?&rdquo; &ldquo;Make a cart wheel.&rdquo; &ldquo;What! Has any one told you that tree is good for a cart?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, a black lion.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good, well said black lion. You can make a fine cart out of that tree, says he. But I tell you that if you flay off the skin from a black lion&rsquo;s neck, and put it around the outer edge of the wheel, like a sheath of iron, just a strip four fingers wide, the wheel will be very strong, and you will gain a great deal by it.&rdquo; &ldquo;But where can I get the skin of a black lion?&rdquo; &ldquo;How stupid you are! The tree stands fast in the forest, and won&rsquo;t run away. You go and find the lion who told you about this tree, and ask him in what part of the tree you are to cut, and bring him here. Then while he suspects nothing, and points out this place or that, wait till he sticks his jaw out, and smite him as he speaks with your sharpest axe, kill him, take the skin, eat the best of the flesh, and fell the tree at your leisure.&rdquo; Thus he indulged his wrath.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">To explain this matter, the Teacher repeated the following verses:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">7. &ldquo;Thus did at once the plassey tree his will and wish make clear:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">I too a message have to tell: O Bhāradvāja, hear!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">8. &lsquo;From shoulder of the king of beasts cut off four inches wide,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">And put it round the wheel, for so more strong it will abide.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">9. So in a trice the plassey tree, indulging in his ire,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">On lions born and those unborn brought down destruction dire.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The cartwright hearing the Tree Devatā&rsquo;s directions, cried out, &ldquo;Ah, this is a lucky day for me!&rdquo; He killed the lion, cut down the tree, and away he went.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The Teacher explained the matter by reciting:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">10. &ldquo;Thus plassey tree contends with beast, and beast with tree contends,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">So each with mutual dispute to death the other sends.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">11. So among men, where&rsquo;er a feud or quarrel does arise,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">They, as the beast and tree did now, cut capers peacock-wise.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">12. This tell I you, that well is you what time you are at one:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Be of one mind, and quarrel not, as beast and tree have done.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">13. Learn peace with all men; this the wise all praise; and who is fain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Of peace and righteousness, he sure will final peace attain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">When they heard the discourse of the king, they were reconciled.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12797"></a><a id="a12798"></a><span class="t30">Then he said: &ldquo;There ought not to be this blind following</span><a id="a12799"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17059"><span class="t9">{1351}</span></a><a id="a12800"></a><a id="a12801"></a><span class="t30"> of one another. A host of quadrupeds in a region of the Himālayas, extending to three thousand leagues, following one another at the word of a hare, all rushed headlong into the great sea. Therefore this following one of another ought not to be,&rdquo; and so saying he related the Daddabhajātaka [Ja 322].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past when Brahmadatta reigned in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a young lion. And when fully grown he lived in a wood. At this time there was near the western ocean a grove of palms mixed with wood apple trees. A certain hare lived here beneath a palm sapling, at the foot of a wood apple tree. One day this hare after feeding came and lay down beneath the young palm tree. And the thought struck him, &ldquo;If this earth should be destroyed, what would become of me?&rdquo; And at this very moment a ripe wood apple fruit fell on a palm leaf. At the sound of it, the hare thought: &ldquo;This solid earth is collapsing,&rdquo; and starting up he fled, without so much as looking behind him. Another hare saw him scampering off, as if frightened to death, and asked the cause of his panic flight. &ldquo;Pray, don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; he said. The other hare cried, &ldquo;Pray, sir, what is it?&rdquo; and kept running after him. Then the hare stopped a moment and without looking back said: &ldquo;The earth here is breaking up.&rdquo; And at this the second hare ran after the other. And so first one and then another hare caught sight of him running, and joined in the chase till one hundred thousand hares all took to flight together. They were seen by a deer, a boar, an elk, a buffalo, a wild ox, a rhinoceros, a tiger, a lion and an elephant. And when they asked what it meant and were told that the earth was breaking up, they too took to flight. So by degrees this host of animals extended to the length of a full league.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">When the Bodhisatta saw this headlong flight of the animals, and heard the cause of it was that the earth was coming to an end, he thought: &ldquo;The earth is nowhere coming to an end. Surely it must be some sound which was misunderstood by them. And if I don&rsquo;t make a great effort, they will all perish. I will save their lives.&rdquo; So with the speed of a lion he got before them to the foot of a mountain, and lion-like roared three times. They were terribly frightened at the lion, and stopping in their flight stood all huddled together. The lion went in amongst them and asked why they were running away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;The earth is collapsing,&rdquo; they answered. &ldquo;Who saw it collapsing?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The elephants know all about it,&rdquo; they replied.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">He asked the elephants. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;the lions know.&rdquo; But the lions said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know, the tigers know.&rdquo; The tigers said: &ldquo;The rhinoceroses know.&rdquo; The rhinoceroses said: &ldquo;The wild oxen know.&rdquo; The wild oxen, &ldquo;The buffaloes.&rdquo; The buffaloes, &ldquo;The elks.&rdquo; The elks, &ldquo;The boars.&rdquo; The boars, &ldquo;The deer.&rdquo; The deer said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know, the hares know.&rdquo; When the hares were questioned, they pointed to one particular hare and said: &ldquo;This one told us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">So the Bodhisatta asked, &ldquo;Is it true, sir, that the earth is breaking up?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir, I saw it,&rdquo; said the hare. &ldquo;Where,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;were you living, when you saw it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Near the ocean, sir, in a grove of palms mixed with wood apple trees. For as I was lying beneath the shade of a palm sapling at the foot of a wood apple tree, I thought, &lsquo;If this earth should break up, where shall I go?&rsquo; And at that very moment I heard the sound of the breaking up of the earth and I fled.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Thought the lion, &ldquo;A ripe wood apple fruit evidently must have fallen on a palm leaf and made a thudding sound, and this hare jumped to the conclusion that the earth was coming to an end, and ran away. I will find out the exact truth about it.&rdquo; So he reassured the herd of animals, and said: &ldquo;I will take the hare and go and find out exactly whether the earth is coming to an end or not, in the place pointed out by him. Until I return, do you stay here.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Then placing the hare on his back, he sprang forward with the speed of a lion, and putting the hare down in the palm grove, he said: &ldquo;Come, show us the place you meant.&rdquo; &ldquo;I dare not, my lord,&rdquo; said the hare. &ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said the lion.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The hare, not venturing to go near the wood apple tree, stood afar off and cried, &ldquo;Yonder, sir, is the place of dreadful sound,&rdquo; and so saying, he repeated the first verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">1. &ldquo;From the spot where I did dwell</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Issued forth a fearful thud;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">What it was I could not tell,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Nor what caused it understood.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">After hearing what the hare said, the lion went to the foot of the wood apple tree, and saw the spot where the hare had been lying beneath the shade of the palm tree, and the ripe wood apple fruit that fell on the palm leaf, and having carefully ascertained that the earth had not broken up, he placed the hare on his back and with the speed of a lion soon came again to the herd of beasts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Then he told them the whole story, and said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo; And having thus reassured the herd of beasts, he let them go. Verily, if it had not been for the Bodhisatta at that time, all the beasts would have rushed into the sea and perished. It was all owing to the Bodhisatta that they escaped death.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">2. &ldquo;Alarmed at sound of fallen fruit</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">A hare once ran away,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">The other beasts all followed suit</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Moved by that hare&rsquo;s dismay.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">3. They hastened not to view the scene,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">But lent a willing ear</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">To idle gossip, and were clean</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Distraught with foolish fear.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">4. They who to wisdom&rsquo;s calm delight</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">And virtue&rsquo;s heights attain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Though ill example should invite,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Such panic fear disdain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">These three verses were spoken after Fully Awakening.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12802"></a><span class="t30">Moreover he said: &ldquo;Sometimes the feeble see the weak points of the mighty, at other times the powerful see the weak points of the feeble, and a quail, a hen-bird, once killed a royal elephant,&rdquo; and he related the Latukikajātaka [Ja 357].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta came to life as a young elephant, and growing up a fine handsome beast, he became the leader of the herd, with a following of eighty thousand elephants, and dwelt in the Himālayas. At that time a quail laid her eggs in the feeding-ground of the elephants. When the eggs were ready to be hatched, the young birds broke the shells and came out. Before their wings had grown, and when they were still unable to fly, the Great Being with his following of eighty thousand elephants, in ranging about for food, came to this spot. On seeing them the quail thought: &ldquo;This royal elephant will trample on my young ones and kill them. Lo! I will implore his righteous protection for the defence of my brood.&rdquo; Then she raised her two wings and standing before him repeated the first verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">1. &ldquo;Elephant of sixty years,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Forest lord amongst your peers,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">I am but a puny bird,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">You a leader of the herd;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">With my wings I homage pay,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Spare my little ones, I pray.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">The Great Being said: &ldquo;O quail, be not troubled. I will protect your offspring.&rdquo; And standing over the young birds, while the eighty thousand elephants passed by, he thus addressed the quail, &ldquo;Behind us comes a solitary rogue elephant. He will not do our bidding. When he comes, do you entreat him too, and so ensure the safety of your offspring.&rdquo; And with these words he made off. And the quail went forth to meet the other elephant, and with both wings uplifted, making respectful salutation, she spoke the second verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">2. &ldquo;Roaming over hill and dale</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Cherishing your lonely way,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">You, O forest king, I hail,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">And with wings my homage pay.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">I am but a wretched quail,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Spare my tender brood to slay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">On hearing her words, the elephant spoke the third verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">3. &ldquo;I will slay your young ones, quail;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">What can your poor help avail?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">My left foot can crush with ease</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Many thousand birds like these.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">And so saying, with his foot he crushed the young birds to atoms, and urinating over them washed them away in a flood of water, and went off loudly trumpeting. The quail sat down on the bough of a tree and said: &ldquo;Then be off with you and trumpet away. You shall very soon see what I will do. You little know what a difference there is between strength of body and strength of mind. Well! I will teach you this lesson.&rdquo; And thus threatening him she repeated the fourth verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">4. &ldquo;Power abused is not all gain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Power is often folly&rsquo;s bane.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Beast that did my young ones kill,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">I will work you mischief still.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">And so saying, shortly afterwards she did a good turn to a crow, and when the crow, who was highly pleased, asked, &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; the quail said: &ldquo;There is nothing else, sir, to be done, but I shall expect you to strike with your beak and to peck out the eyes of this rogue elephant.&rdquo; The crow readily assented, and the quail then did a service to a blue fly, and when the fly asked, &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;When the eyes of this rogue elephant have been put out by the crow, then I want you to let fall an egg upon them.&rdquo; The fly agreed, and then the quail did a kindness to a frog, and when the frog asked what it was to do, she said: &ldquo;When this rogue elephant becomes blind, and shall be searching for water to drink, then take your stand and utter a croak on the top of a mountain, and when he has climbed to the top, come down and croak again at the bottom of the precipice. This much I shall look for at your hands.&rdquo; After hearing what the quail said, the frog readily assented.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">So one day the crow with its beak pecked out both the eyes of the elephant, and the fly dropped its eggs upon them, and the elephant being eaten up with maggots was maddened by the pain, and overcome with thirst wandered about seeking for water to drink. At this moment the frog standing on the top of a mountain uttered a croak. Thought the elephant, &ldquo;There must be water there,&rdquo; and climbed up the mountain. Then the frog descended, and standing at the bottom croaked again. The elephant thought: &ldquo;There will be water there,&rdquo; and moved forward towards the precipice, and rolling over fell to the bottom of the mountain and was killed. When the quail knew that the elephant was dead, she said: &ldquo;I have seen the back of my enemy,&rdquo; and in a high state of delight strutted over his body, and passed away to fare according to her deeds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, one ought not to incur the hostility of anyone. These four creatures, by combining together, brought about the destruction of this elephant, strong as he was.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">5. &ldquo;A quail with crow, blue fly and frog allied</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Once proved the issue of a deadly feud.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Through them king elephant untimely died:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Therefore all quarrelling should be eschewed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">This verse was spoken after Fully Awakening.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12803"></a><span class="t30">Thus to appease the quarrel he told three Jātaka Stories, and to illustrate the effects of unity he told two more Jātaka Stories. &ldquo;In the case of such as dwell together in unity, no one finds any opening for attack,&rdquo; and so saying he told the Rukkhadhammajātaka [Ja 74].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the first king Vessavaṇa died, and Sakka sent a new king to reign in his stead. After the change, the new king Vessavaṇa sent word to all trees and shrubs and bushes and plants, bidding the Tree Devatās each choose out the abode that they liked best. In those days the Bodhisatta had come to life as a Tree Devatā in a Sāl-forest in the Himālayas. His advice to his kinsfolk in choosing their habitations was to shun trees that stood alone in the open, and to take up their abodes all round the abode which he had chosen in that Sāl-forest. Hereon the wise Tree Devatās, following the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s advice, took up their quarters round his tree. But the foolish ones said: &ldquo;Why should we dwell in the forest? Let us rather seek out the haunts of men, and take up our abodes outside villages, towns, or capital cities. For Devatās who dwell in such places receive the richest offerings and the greatest worship.&rdquo; So they departed to the haunts of men, and took up their abode in certain giant trees which grew in an open space.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now it fell out upon a day that a mighty tempest swept over the country. Naught did it avail the solitary trees that years had rooted them deep in the soil and that they were the mightiest trees that grew. Their branches snapped; their stems were broken; and they themselves were uprooted and flung to earth by the tempest. But when it broke on the Sāl-forest of interlacing trees, its fury was in vain; for, attack where it might, not a tree could it overthrow.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">The forlorn Devatās whose dwellings were destroyed, took their children in their arms and journeyed to the Himālayas. There they told their sorrows to the Devatās of the Sāl-forest, who in turn told the Bodhisatta of their sad return. &ldquo;It was because they hearkened not to the words of wisdom, that they have been brought to this,&rdquo; said he; and he unfolded the truth in this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">1. &ldquo;United, forest-like, should kinsfolk stand;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">The storm o&rsquo;erthrows the solitary tree.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">So spake the Bodhisatta; and when his life was spent, he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12804"></a><span class="t30">He also said: &ldquo;Against such as were at unity, no one could find a loophole for attack, but when they quarrelled one with another, a certain hunter brought about their destruction and went off with them: verily there is no satisfaction in a quarrel,&rdquo; and with these words he related the Vaṭṭakajātaka [Ja 33].</span><a id="a12805"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17061"><span class="t9">{1352}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">In the past when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born a quail, and lived in the forest at the head of many thousands of quails. In those days a fowler who caught quails came to that place; and he used to imitate the note of a quail till he saw that the birds had been drawn together, when he flung his net over them, and whipped the sides of the net together, so as to get them all huddled up in a heap. Then he crammed them into his basket, and going home sold his prey for a living.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Now one day the Bodhisatta said to those quails, &ldquo;This fowler is making havoc among our kinsfolk. I have a device whereby he will be unable to catch us. Henceforth, the very moment he throws the net over you, let each one put his head through a mesh and then all of you together must fly away with the net to such place as you please, and there let it down on a thorn-brake; this done, we will all escape from our several meshes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said they all in ready agreement.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">On the morrow, when the net was cast over them, they did just as the Bodhisatta had told them: they lifted up the net, and let it down on a thorn-brake, escaping themselves from underneath. While the fowler was still disentangling his net, evening came on; and he went away empty-handed. On the morrow and following days the quails played the same trick. So that it became the regular thing for the fowler to be engaged till sunset disentangling his net, and then to betake himself home empty-handed. Accordingly his wife grew angry and said: &ldquo;Day by day you return empty-handed; I suppose you&rsquo;ve got a second establishment to keep up elsewhere.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">&ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; said the fowler, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no second establishment to keep up. The fact is those quails have come to work together now. The moment my net is over them, off they fly with it and escape, leaving it on a thorn-brake. Still, they won&rsquo;t live in unity always. Don&rsquo;t you bother yourself; as soon as they start bickering among themselves, I shall bag the lot, and that will bring a smile to your face to see.&rdquo; And so saying, he repeated this verse to his wife:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">1. &ldquo;While concord reigns, the birds bear off the net.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">When quarrels rise, they&rsquo;ll fall a prey to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t11">Not long after this, one of the quails, in alighting on their feeding ground, trod by accident on another&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Who trod on my head?&rdquo; angrily cried this latter. &ldquo;I did; but I didn&rsquo;t mean to. Don&rsquo;t be angry,&rdquo; said the first quail. But notwithstanding this answer, the other remained as angry as before. Continuing to answer one another, they began to swap taunts, saying: &ldquo;I suppose it is you single-handed who lift up the net.&rdquo; As they wrangled thus with one another, the Bodhisatta thought to himself, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no safety with one who is quarrelsome. The time has come when they will no longer lift up the net, and thereby they will come to great destruction. The fowler will get his opportunity. I can stay here no longer.&rdquo; And thereupon he with his following went elsewhere.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">Sure enough the fowler came back again a few days later, and first collecting them together by imitating the note of a quail, flung his net over them. Then said one quail, &ldquo;They say when you were at work lifting the net, the hair of your head fell off. Now&rsquo;s your time; lift away.&rdquo; The other rejoined, &ldquo;When you were lifting the net, they say both your wings moulted. Now&rsquo;s your time; lift away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t11">But while they were each inviting the other to lift the net, the fowler himself lifted the net for them and crammed them in a heap into his basket and bore them off home, so that his wife&rsquo;s face was wreathed with smiles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After he had thus related these five Jātaka Stories, he finished up by reciting the Attadaṇḍasutta [Snp 4.15]:</span><a id="a12806"></a><a href="notes2.html#a17063"><span class="t9">{1353}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a12807"></a><span class="t25">1. &ldquo;Fear arises from one with a stick, see the people arguing,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">I will explain my spiritual anxiety, how it agitated me.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">2. Having seen the people trembling, like fish in little water,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Having seen them opposing each other, fear took control of me.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">3. The world on all sides lack substance, all quarters were shaken,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Desiring a home for myself, I did not see (anywhere) unoccupied.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">4. Having seen people opposed at the end, I did not take delight,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Then I saw a barb here, hard to see, lodged in the heart.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">5. Overcome by this barb, one wanders in all directions,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Having removed that barb, one does not run or sink.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">6. Here they recite the training rules:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Whatever bonds are in the world, one should not be engaged by them,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Breaking through sensuality on all sides, one should train oneself for Nibbāna.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">7. One should be truthful, humble, undeceitful, rid of slander,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Without anger, a sage should cross over desire, and wicked greed.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">8. One should overcome sleepiness, sloth and torpor, and not associate with heedlessness,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">The man with his mind on Nibbāna should not persist in conceit.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">9. He should not be guided by false speech, or have a love for forms,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">One should understand conceit, and live without violence.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">10. He should not take joy in the past, or have a preference for the new,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">He should not grieve over what is in decline, he should not be attached to attractive objects.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">11. I say greed is a great ocean, I say longing is a torrent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Sensual objects are a fixation, the swamp of sensuality is hard to cross over.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">The sage, the brahmin, not veering from the truth, stands on high ground,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Having renounced everything, he is said to be peaceful.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">13. He who knows has gone to the end of knowledge;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Having understood the Dhamma, he is independent,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Behaving properly in the world, he envies no one here.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Whoever has crossed beyond sensuality,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">The attachment difficult to cross over in the world,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Does not grieve, does not fret,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Having cut through the stream, without bondage.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">15. He should destroy what is in the past, and have nothing for the future,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">If he does not grasp at the present, he will live at peace.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">16. The one who does not treasure anything about name and form,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">And does not grieve for what does not exist, suffers no loss in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">17. For whoever has no thought of &lsquo;This is mine,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Something belongs to others,&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">In whom ownership is not found, does not grieve (thinking): &lsquo;Nothing is mine.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">18. Not bitter, not greedy, unshaken, at peace everywhere,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">When asked this is what I say is an advantage for those who are unshaken.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">19. For the unshaken, who know, there is no accumulation,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">Abstaining from merit-making, he sees safety everywhere.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">20. The sage does not say he is amongst equals, inferiors, or superiors,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t25">He is peaceful, without selfishness, he neither takes up nor lays down.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">Becoming believers the kings said: &ldquo;Had not the Teacher come, we should have slain one another and set flowing rivers of blood. It is owing to the Teacher that we are alive. But if the Teacher had adopted the lay life, the realm of the four great island-continents, together with two thousand lesser islands, would have passed into </span><span class="t18">[5.221] </span><span class="t30">his hands and he would have had more than a thousand sons. Moreover he would have had an escort of warrior lords. But foregoing this glory he gave up the world </span><span class="t18">{5.415}</span><span class="t30"> and attained to Supreme Awakening. Now too let him wander forth with a following of warrior lords.&rdquo; So the two peoples each of them offered him two hundred and fifty princes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Fortunate One after ordaining them retired to a great forest. From the next day onward, escorted by them, he went his rounds for alms in the two cities, sometimes in Kapilavatthu, at other times in Koliya, and the people of both cities paid him great honour. Amongst these men, who were ordained not so much for their own pleasure as out of respect to the Teacher, spiritual discontent sprang up. And their former wives to stir up their discontent sent such and such messages to them, and they grew yet more dissatisfied. The Fortunate One on reflection discovered how discontented they were and thought: &ldquo;These monks, though living with a Buddha like me, are discontented. I wonder what kind of preaching would be profitable to them,&rdquo; and he bethought him of the Kuṇāla Dhamma discourse. Then this notion struck him, &ldquo;I will conduct these monks to the Himālayas and after illustrating the defilements connected with womankind by the Kuṇāla story and removing their discontent, I will bestow upon them the first stage of the paths.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So in the morning putting on his under garment and taking his alms bowl and robes he went his rounds in Kapilavatthu, and having returned and taken his noonday meal, when the repast was finished, he addressed these five hundred monks and asked, &ldquo;Was the delightful region of the Himālayas ever seen by you before?&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;Nay, venerable sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Will you go on pilgrimage to the Himālayas?&rdquo; &ldquo;Venerable sir, we have no Supernormal Powers; how should we go?&rdquo; &ldquo;But supposing someone were to take you with him, would you go?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher by his Supernormal Powers caught them all up with him in the air and transported them to the Himālayas and standing in the sky he pointed out to them in a pleasant tract of the Himālayas various mountains, Golden Mount, Jewel Mount, Vermilion Mount, Collyrium Mount, Table-land Mount, Crystal Mount, and five great rivers, and the lakes, Kaṇṇamuṇḍaka, Rathakāra, Sīhappapāta, Chaddanta, Tiyaggala, Anotatta and Kuṇāla, seven lakes in all.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a12808"></a><span class="t30">The Himālayas is a vast region, five hundred leagues in height, three thousand leagues in breadth. This charming part of it by his mighty power did he show them, and the dwelling places that were built there, the quadrupeds too, troops of lions, tigers, elephants and so forth did he show from this place &ndash; sacred groves and other pleasances, flowering and fruit-bearing trees, flocks of all manner of birds, water and land plants &ndash; on the east side of the Himālayas a golden table land, on the west side a vermilion one.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">From the first sight of these charming regions, the passionate longing of these monks for their former wives passed off. Then the Teacher with these monks </span><span class="t18">{5.416}</span><span class="t30"> alighting from the air on the west side of the Himālayas on a rocky plateau sixty leagues in extent, in Red Valley three leagues long, beneath a Sāl tree covering seven leagues and lasting a whole aeon, the Teacher, I say, escorted by these monks, emitting the six-coloured rays and stirring up the depths of the ocean and blazing like the sun took his seat, and speaking with a voice sweet as honey he thus addressed these monks, &ldquo;Monks, inquire of me about some marvel you have never seen before in this Himālayas.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At that moment two spotted cuckoos, seizing a stick at both ends in their mouths, in the centre of it had placed their lord. Eight cuckoos in front and eight behind, eight on the right and eight on the left, eight below and eight above, thus casting a shadow over their lord as they escorted him, were flying through the air. These monks on seeing this flock of birds asked the Teacher, &ldquo;What, sir, is the meaning of these birds?&rdquo; &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is an ancient custom of our family, a tradition set up by me; in a former age they thus escorted me. Now at that time there was a vast gathering of these birds. Three thousand five hundred young hen-birds escorted me. Gradually wasting away the flock has become such as you see.&rdquo; &ldquo;In what kind of forest did they escort you, sir?&rdquo; Then the Teacher said: &ldquo;Well, hearken, monks,&rdquo; and recalling it to mind he told a story of the past and thus taught them.</span><span class="t18"> [5.222]</span></p>
