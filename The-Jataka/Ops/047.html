<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present one jackal fouls the well he drinks from, and is driven off by the novices. The Buddha tells a story of how a similar event happened in a previous life and how he had admonished the jackal who avowed that his ancestors did ever behave this way.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;This well a forest-ascetic.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told while dwelling at Isipatana, about a jackal that fouled a well.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">We learn that a jackal used to foul a well where the monks used to draw water, and then used to make off. One day the novices pelted him with clods of earth, and made it uncomfortable for him. After that he never came to look at the place again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks heard of this and began to discuss it in the Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;Friend, the jackal that used to foul our well has never come near it since the novices chased him away with clods!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and asked what they were talking about now as they sat together. They told him. Then he replied, &ldquo;Monks, this is not the first time that this jackal fouled a well. He did the same before,&rdquo; and then he told a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">[2.244]</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, in this place near Benares called Isipatana was that very well. At that time the Bodhisatta was born of a good family. When he grew up he embraced the ascetic life, and with a body of followers dwelt at Isipatana. A certain jackal fouled the well as has been described, and took to his heels. One day, the ascetics surrounded him, and having caught him somehow, they led him before the Bodhisatta. He addressed the jackal in the lines of the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6874"></a><a id="a6875"></a><a id="a6876"></a><a id="a6877"></a><span class="t12">1. Āraññikassa isino cirarattatapassino,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6878"></a><a id="a6879"></a><a id="a6880"></a><span class="t12">Kicchākataṁ udapānaṁ kathaṁ samma avāhayī ti?</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6881"></a><a id="a6882"></a><a id="a6883"></a><a id="a6884"></a><span class="t4">For the seer in the wilds who lives austere for many nights, dear friend, why did you spoil this well which was made with difficulty?</span><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t47">{2.355}</span></p>
<p class="p23">On hearing this, the jackal repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6885"></a><a id="a6886"></a><a id="a6887"></a><span class="t12">2. Esa dhammo siṅgālānaṁ, yaṁ pitvā ohadāmase, </span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6888"></a><a id="a6889"></a><a id="a6890"></a><a id="a6891"></a><a id="a6892"></a><span class="t12">Pitupitāmahaṁ dhammo, na taṁ ujjhātum-ar</span><span class="t46">a</span><span class="t12">hasī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6893"></a><a id="a6894"></a><a id="a6895"></a><span class="t4">This is the nature of jackals, having drunk I must urinate, it is our fathers&rsquo; and grandfathers&rsquo; nature, you should not blame us.</span></p>
<p class="p23">Then the Bodhisatta replied with the third:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6896"></a><a id="a6897"></a><a id="a6898"></a><a id="a6899"></a><a id="a6900"></a><span class="t12">3. Yesaṁ vo ediso dhammo, adhammo pana kīdiso?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6901"></a><a id="a6902"></a><a id="a6903"></a><span class="t12">Mā vo dhammaṁ adhammaṁ vā, addasāma kudācanan-ti!</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6904"></a><span class="t4">Those for whom such is natural, what would be unnatural? Don&rsquo;t let me see your natural or unnatural any time!</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus the Great Being admonished him, and said: &ldquo;Do not go there again.&rdquo; Thenceforward he did not even pause to look at it.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse he declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;The jackal that fouled the well is the same in both cases; and I was the chief of the ascetic band.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a6916"></a><span class="t34">During one rainy season the two chief disciples, desiring to leave the multitude and to dwell apart, took leave of the Teacher, and went into the kingdom where Kokālika was. They repaired to the residence of Kokālika, and said this to him, &ldquo;Monk Kokālika, since for us it is delightful to dwell with you, and for you to dwell with us, we would abide here three months.&rdquo; &ldquo;How,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;will it be delightful for you to dwell with me?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;If you tell not a soul that the two chief disciples are dwelling here, we shall be happy, and that will be our delight in dwelling with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;And how is it delightful for me to dwell with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;We will teach the Dhamma to you for three months in your home, and we will discourse to you, and that will be your delight in dwelling with us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dwell here, monks,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so long as you will,&rdquo; and he allotted a pleasant residence to them. There they dwelt in the fruition of the Attainments, and no man knew of their dwelling in that place.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When they had thus past the rains they said to him, &ldquo;Monk, now we have dwelt with you, and we will go to visit the Teacher,&rdquo; and asked his leave to go. He agreed, and went with them on the rounds for alms in a village over against the place where they were. After their meal the elders departed from the village. Kokālika leaving them, turned back and said to the people, &ldquo;Lay brethren, you are like brute animals. Here the two chief disciples have been dwelling for three months in the monastery opposite, and you knew nothing of it: now they are gone.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why did you not tell us, sir?&rdquo; the people asked.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then they took ghee and oil and medicines, raiment and clothes, and approached the elders, saluting them and saying: &ldquo;Pardon us, sirs we knew not you were the chief disciples, we have learned it but today by the words of the venerable monk Kokālika. Pray have compassion on us, and receive these medicines and clothes.&rdquo; Kokālika went after the elders with them, for he thought: &ldquo;The elders are frugal, and content with little; they will not accept these things, and then they will be given to me.&rdquo; But the elders, because the gift was offered at the instigation of a monk, neither accepted the things themselves nor had them given to Kokālika. The lay folk then said: &ldquo;Sirs, if you will not accept these, come here once again to bless us.&rdquo; The elders promised, and proceeded to the Teacher&rsquo;s presence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now Kokālika was angry, because the elders neither accepted those things themselves, nor had them given to him. The elders, however, having remained a short while with the Teacher, each chose five hundred monks as their following, and with these thousand monks went on pilgrimage seeking alms, as far as Kokālika&rsquo;s country. The lay folk came out to meet them, and led them to the same monastery, and showed them great honour day by day.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Great was the store given them of clothes and of medicines. Those monks who went out with the elders dividing the garments gave of them to all the monks which had come, but to Kokālika gave none, neither did the elders give him any. Getting no clothes Kokālika began to abuse and revile the elders, &ldquo;Sāriputta and Moggallāna are full of wicked desire; they would not accept before what was offered them, but these things they do accept. There is no satisfying them, they have no regard for another.&rdquo; But the elders, perceiving that the man was harbouring evil on their account, set out with their followers to depart; nor would they return, not though the people begged them to stay yet a few days longer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6917"></a><span class="t34">Then a young monk said: &ldquo;Where shall the elders stay, laymen? Your own particular elder does not wish them to stay here.&rdquo; Then the people went to Kokālika, and said: &ldquo;Sir, we are told you do not wish the elders to stay here. Go to! Either appease them and bring them back, or away with you and live elsewhere!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6918"></a><span class="t30">Here again Kokālika said: &ldquo;I will bring Sāriputta and Moggallāna back with me.&rdquo; So having left Kokālika&rsquo;s country, he travelled to Jetavana, greeted the Teacher, and went on to the </span><span class="t18">[2.245]</span><span class="t30"> elders. He said: &ldquo;Friends, the citizens of Kokālika&rsquo;s country summon you. Let us go there!&rdquo; &ldquo;Go yourself, friend, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the answer. After this refusal he went away by himself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks got talking about this in the Dhamma Hall. &ldquo;Friend! Kokālika can&rsquo;t live either with Sāriputta and Moggallāna, or without them! He can&rsquo;t put up with their room or their company!&rdquo; The Teacher came in, and enquired what they were all talking about together. They told him. He said: &ldquo;In olden days, just as now, Kokālika couldn&rsquo;t live with Sāriputta and Moggallāna, or without them.&rdquo; And he told a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was a Tree Devatā living in a wood. Not far from his abode lived another Tree Devatā, in a great monarch of the forest. In the same forest dwelt a lion and a tiger. For fear of them no one did till the earth, or cut down a tree, no one could even pause to look at it, and the lion and tiger used to kill and eat all manner of creatures; and what remained after eating, they left on the spot and departed, so that the forest was full of foul decaying stench.</p>
<p class="p7">The other spirit, being foolish and knowing neither reason nor unreason, one day bespoke thus the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Good friend, the forest is full of foul stench all because of this lion and this tiger. I will drive then away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Said he, &ldquo;Good friend, it is just these two creatures <span class="t18">{2.357}</span> that protect our homes. Once they are driven off, our homes will be made desolate. If men see not the lion and the tiger tracks, they will cut all the forest down, make it all one open space, and till the land. Please do not do this thing!&rdquo; and then he uttered the first two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6919"></a><a id="a6920"></a><a id="a6921"></a><a id="a6922"></a><span class="t12">1. Yena mittena saṁsaggā, yogakkhemo vihiyyati,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a6929"></a><a id="a6930"></a><a id="a6931"></a><a id="a6932"></a><span class="t4">Through association with a bad friend, security decreases, the wise one should guard his predominance like he should guard his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6933"></a><a id="a6934"></a><span class="t12">2. Yena mittena saṁsaggā, yogakkhemo pavaḍḍhati,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6935"></a><a id="a6936"></a><span class="t12">Kareyyattasamaṁ vuttiṁ sabbakiccesu paṇḍito ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a6937"></a><a id="a6938"></a><span class="t4">Through association with a good friend, security increases, the wise one should do all his duties in life for one like himself.</span></p>
<p class="p23">When the Bodhisatta had thus explained the matter, the foolish Devatā notwithstanding did not lay it to heart, but one day assumed an awful shape, and drove away the lion and tiger. The people, no longer seeing their footmarks, divined that the lion and tiger must have gone to another wood, and cut down one side of this wood.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the Devatā came up to the Bodhisatta <span class="t18">{2.358}</span> and said to him, &ldquo;Ah, friend, I did not do as you said, but drove the creatures away; and now men have found out that they are gone, and they are cutting down the wood! What is to be done?&rdquo; The reply was, that they were <span class="t18">[2.246] </span>gone to live in such and such a wood; the Devatā must go and fetch them back. This the Devatā did; and, standing in front of them, repeated the third verse, with a respectful salute:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6939"></a><a id="a6940"></a><span class="t12">3. Etha byagghā nivattavho, paccupetha mahāvanaṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6941"></a><a id="a6942"></a><span class="t12">Mā vanaṁ chindi nibyagghaṁ, byagghā māhesu nibbanā ti.</span></p>

<p class="p23">This request they refused, saying: &ldquo;Go away! We will not come.&rdquo; The Devatā returned to the forest alone. And the men after a very few days cut down all the wood, made fields, and brought them under cultivation.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;Kokālika was then the foolish Devatā, Sāriputta the lion, Moggallāna the tiger, and the wise Devatā was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

The Story of the Present has been told in the Section with Two Verses.</span><a id="a6956"></a><a href="notes.html#a15327"><span class="t9">{520}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6957"></a><a id="a6958"></a><span class="t34">It seems the king of Kosala had two ministers, who were attendants and leaders of a guild, who, whenever one saw the other, quarrelled. They naturally became enemies in the whole city. Neither the king, nor relatives, were able to reconcile them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then one day in the morning the Teacher, while looking round to see who was capable of being released from bondage, saw these two had the supporting conditions for the Path of Stream-Entry.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">And on another day he entered Sāvatthī alone for alms, and stood at the door of one of their houses. After coming out, taking the bowl, leading the Teacher inside the residence, he had him sit down on the prepared seat. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6959"></a><a id="a6960"></a><span class="t34">While sitting there the Teacher taught about the advantages ofdeveloping loving-kindness, and when he knew his mind was ready, he explained the truths, and at the end of the truths he was established in the Fruit of Stream-Entry. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Teacher, knowing he had the state of Stream-Entry, after making him take the bowl, rose and went to the door of the other&rsquo;s house. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">After he had come out, he paid respects to the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;Enter, venerable sir,&rdquo; and after entering he made him sit down. The other minister also took the bowl, and entered together with the Teacher. The Teacher praised the eleven advantages of loving-kindness, and when he knew his mind was ready, he explained the truths, and at the end of the truths he was also established in the Fruit of Stream-Entry. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">These two both having Stream-Entry, confessed their offences to each other, and after asking forgiveness, and being reconciled and on good terms, their intentions were one and the same. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">That very day face to face with the Fortunate One they ate together. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Teacher, after he had finshed the meal duties, returned to the monastery. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Carrying a lot of garlands, incense, creams, and ghee, honey and molasses, they entered together with the Teacher. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">The Teacher, having explained the duties to the monastic Saṅgha, </span><span class="t35">{2.13}</span><span class="t34"> and given advice, entered into the Perfumed Hut. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6961"></a><span class="t30">The next morning, amongst the monastics in the Dhamma Hall, this talk about the Teacher&rsquo;s virtues arose: &ldquo;Friends, the Teacher tames the untamed, these two ministers were striving for a long time, but neither was the king able to bring about reconciliation, and nor were their relatives, friends and so on able, but in just one day the Realised One tamed them.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the Teacher came, he asked: &ldquo;And what, monastics, are you discussing while sitting here?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Namely, this,&rdquo; they said. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Now, monastics, I have reconciled whese two people, and before I also reconclied them,&rdquo; and after saying that, he delivered a story about the past. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6962"></a>In the past, when King Brahmadatta was ruling in Benares, the Bodhisatta, after being reborn in a brahmin family in the Kāsi country, maturing, and learning all the crafts at Taxila, abandoned sensual pleasures, and went forth in the seer&rsquo;s going forth. He built an ashram on the bank of the Gaṅges in the foothills of the Himālayas, and there, after the Super Knowledges and Attainments had arisen, he dwelt enjoying the joy of the Absorptions. </p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6963"></a>It seems in this Birth the Bodhisatta had supreme impartiality, and fulfilled the Perfection of Equanimity. </p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6964"></a><a id="a6965"></a>As he was sitting at the door to his leaf hut one cheeky, immoral, monkey came, and tried to insert his male organ into his ears.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta, without resisting, being impartial, sat right there. </p>
<p class="p7">Then one day one turtle, after rising out of the water, after opening its mouth on the river bank, slept there warming himself in the sunshine. </p>
<p class="p7">Having seen that, the agitated monkey inserted his penis into his mouth. </p>
<p class="p7">After the turtle woke up, he bit his male organ like someone closing a casket, and strong pain arise. </p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6966"></a><a id="a6967"></a><a id="a6968"></a>Unable to bear the pain, the monkey said: &ldquo;I will go into the presence of anyone who can free me from this suffering,&rdquo; and he thought: &ldquo;Another cannot free me from this suffering, none have the skill, except this ascetic. It is suitable for me to go into his presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Holding the turtle with both hands, he went into the presence of the Bodhisatta. </p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta joking with the immoral monkey spoke the first verse: </p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6969"></a><a id="a6970"></a><span class="t12">1. Ko nu uddhitabhatto va, pūrahattho va brāhmaṇo,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a6972"></a><a id="a6973"></a><a id="a6974"></a><span class="t4">Who is that with a pile of food, like a brahmin with a handful? Where did you wander to almsfood? What funeral did you attend?</span></p>
<p class="p23">Having heard that, the immoral monkey spoke the second verse: </p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6975"></a><a id="a6976"></a><span class="t12">2. Ahaṁ kapismi&rsquo; dummedho, anāmāsāni āmasiṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p23">Having compassion the Bodhisatta, conversing with the turtle, spoke the third verse: </p>

He too was brought to the Dhamma Hall, when the Teacher said: &ldquo;It is not only now that he is greedy; he was greedy before, and his greed lost him his life; and by his means wise men of old were driven out of house and home.&rdquo; Then he told a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a6996"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, a rich merchant&rsquo;s cook of that town hung up a nest-basket in the kitchen to win merit by it. The Bodhisatta at that time was a pigeon; and he came and lived in it.</p>
<p class="p7">Now a greedy crow as he flew over the kitchen was attracted by the fish which lay about in great variety. He fell hungering after it. &ldquo;How in the world can I get some?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.362}</span> thought he. Then his eye fell upon the Bodhisatta. &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make this creature do my work.&rdquo; And this is how he carried out his resolve.</p>
<p class="p7">When the pigeon went out to seek his day&rsquo;s food, behind him, following, following, came the crow.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;What do you want with me, Mr. Crow?&rdquo; said the pigeon. &ldquo;You and I don&rsquo;t feed alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Ah, but I like you,&rdquo; says the crow. &ldquo;Let me be your humble servant, and feed with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The pigeon agreed. But when they went feeding together, the crow only pretended to eat with him; ever and anon he would turn back, peck to bits some lump of cow-dung, and get a worm or two. When he had had his bellyful, up he flew, &ldquo;Hello, Mr. Pigeon! What a time you take over your meal! You never know where to draw the line. Come, let&rsquo;s be going back before it is too late.&rdquo; And so they did. When they got back together, the cook, seeing that their pigeon had brought a friend, hung up another basket.</p>
<p class="p7">In this way things went on for four or five days. Then a great purchase of fish came to the rich man&rsquo;s kitchen. How the crow longed <span class="t18">[2.249] </span>for some! There he lay, from early morn, groaning and making a great noise.</p>
<p class="p7">In the morning, the pigeon said to the crow: &ldquo;Come along, old fellow, breakfast!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;You can go,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have such a fit of indigestion!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;A crow with indigestion? Nonsense!&rdquo; said the pigeon. &ldquo;Even a lamp-wick hardly stays any time in your stomach; and anything else you digest in a trice, as soon as you eat it. Now you do what I tell you. <span class="t18">{2.363}</span> Don&rsquo;t behave in this way just for seeing a little fish!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Why, sir, what are you saying? I tell, you I have a bad pain inside!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; said the pigeon, &ldquo;only do take care.&rdquo; And away he flew.</p>
<p class="p7">The cook got all the dishes ready, and then stood at the kitchen door, mopping the sweat off him. &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s my time!&rdquo; thinks Mr. Crow, and alights on a dish with some dainty food in it. Click! The cook heard the noise, and looked round. Ah! In a twinkling he caught the crow, and plucked off all his feathers, except one tuft on the top of his head; then he powdered ginger and cinnamon, and mixed it up with buttermilk, and rubbed it in well all over the bird&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for spoiling my master&rsquo;s dinner, and making me throw it away!&rdquo; said he, and threw him into his basket. Oh, how it hurt!</p>
<p class="p7">By and by, in came the pigeon from his hunt. The first thing he saw was our crow, making a great to-do. What fun he did make of him, to be sure! He broke into poetry, as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a6997"></a><a id="a6998"></a><a id="a6999"></a><a id="a7000"></a><span class="t12">1. Kāyaṁ balākā sikhinī, corī laṅghipitāmahā?</span></p>

<p class="p23">To this the crow answered with another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7011"></a><a id="a7012"></a><a id="a7013"></a><span class="t12">2. Nāhaṁ balākā sikhinī, ahaṁ lolosmi vāyaso,</span></p>

<p class="p23">And the pigeon rejoined with a third:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7018"></a><span class="t12">3. Punapāpajjasī samma, sīlañ-hi tava tādisaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p23">Then the pigeon flew away, saying: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t live with this creature.&rdquo; And the crow lay there groaning until he died.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, at the conclusion of the Truths the greedy monk reached the Fruit of the Third Path. &ldquo;The greedy monk in those days was the greedy crow; and I was the pigeon.&rdquo;</span></p>

One day they came to the river Aciravatī. After a bath, they stood on the sand, basking in the sunlight and talking pleasantly together. At this moment two wild geese flew over their heads. One of the young fellows picked up a stone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to hit that goose bird in the eye!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says the other. &ldquo;That I can,&rdquo; says the first, &ldquo;and not only that &ndash; I can hit either this eye or that eye, as I please.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not you!&rdquo; says the other. &ldquo;Look here, then!&rdquo; says the first; and picking up a three-cornered stone, threw it after the bird. The bird turned its head on hearing the pebble whizz through the air. Then the other, seizing a round pebble, threw it so that it hit the near eye and came out of the other. The goose with a loud cry turned over and over and fell at their very feet.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7073"></a><a id="a7074"></a><a id="a7075"></a><span class="t30">The monks who were standing about saw what had occurred, and ran up, reproaching him. &ldquo;What a shame,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;that you, who have embraced such a dispensation as ours, should take the life of a living creature!&rdquo; They made him go before the Tathāgata with them. &ldquo;Is what they say true?&rdquo; asked the Teacher. &ldquo;Have you really taken the life of a living creature?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the monk. &ldquo;Monk,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how is it that you have done this thing, after embracing so great a dispensation? Wise men of old, before the Buddha appeared, though they lived in the world, and the worldly life is impure, felt remorse about mere trifles; but you, who have embraced this great dispensation, have no scruples. A monk ought to hold himself in control in deed, word, and thought.&rdquo; Then he told a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Dhanañjaya was king of Indapatta City, in the Kuru kingdom, the Bodhisatta was born as a son of his queen consort. By and by he grew up, and was educated at Taxila. His father made him viceroy, <span class="t18">{2.367}</span> and afterwards on his father&rsquo;s death he became king, and grew in the Kuru righteousness, keeping the ten royal duties. The Kuru righteousness means the five precepts; these the Bodhisatta observed, and kept pure; as did the Bodhisatta, even so did queen-mother, queen-consort, younger brother, viceroy, family priest, brahmin, driver, courtier, charioteer, treasurer, master of the granaries, noble, porter, courtesan, slave girl &ndash; all did the same.<a id="a7076"></a><a href="notes.html#a15335"><span class="t9">{524}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">King, mother, consort, viceroy, family priest too,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Driver and charioteer and treasurer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And he that governed the king&rsquo;s granaries,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Porter, and courtesan, eleven in all,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Observed the rules of Kuru righteousness. </span><span class="t18">[2.252]</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a7077"></a>Thus all these did observe the five precepts, and kept them untarnished. The king built six alms houses &ndash; one at each of the four city gates, one in the midst of the city, and one at his own door; daily he distributed 600,000 pieces of money in alms, by which he stirred up the whole of Jambudīpa. All Jambudīpa was overspread by his love and delight in generosity.</p>
<p class="p7">At this period there was in the city of Dantapura, in the kingdom of Kāliṅga, a king named Kāliṅga. In his realms the rain fell not, and because of the drought there was a famine in the land. The people thought that lack of food might produce a pestilence; and there was fear of drought, and fear of famine &ndash; these three fears were ever present before them. The people wandered about destitute here and there, leading their children by the hand. All the people in the kingdom gathered together, and came to Dantapura; and there at the king&rsquo;s door they made outcry.</p>
<p class="p7">As the king stood, by the window, he heard the noise, and asked why the people were making all that noise. <span class="t18">{2.368}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Oh, sire,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;three fears have seized upon all your kingdom: there falls no rain, the crops fail, there is a famine. The people, starving, diseased, and destitute, are wandering about with their little ones by the hand. Make rain for us, O king!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Said the king, &ldquo;What used former monarchs to do, if it would not rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Former monarchs, O king, if it would not rain, used to give alms, to keep the holy day, to make vows of virtue, and to lie down seven days in their chamber on a grass pallet: then the rain would fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; the king said; and even so did he. Still even so there came no rain. The king said to his court,</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;As you bade me, so I have done; but there is no rain. What am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7078"></a>&ldquo;O king, in the city of Indapatta, there is a state elephant, named Añjanavasabho [Black Bull]. It belongs to Dhanañjaya, the Kuru king. This let us fetch; then the rain will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But how can we do that? The king and his army are not easy to overcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;O king, there is no need to fight him. The king is fond of giving, he loves giving: were he but asked, he would even cut off his head in all its magnificence, or tear out his gracious eyes, or give up his very kingdom. There will be no need even to plead for the elephant. He will give it without fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But who is able to ask him?&rdquo; said the king.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;The brahmins, great king!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king summoned eight brahmins from a brahmin village, and with all honour and respect sent them to ask for the elephant. They took <span class="t18">[2.253] </span>money for their journey, and donned travelling garb, and without resting past one night in a place, travelled quickly until after a few days they took their meal at the alms-hall in the city gate. When they had satisfied their bodily wants, they asked, &ldquo;When does the king come to the alms house?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The answer was, <span class="t18">{2.369}</span> &ldquo;On three days in the fortnight &ndash; fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth; tomorrow is the full moon, so he will come tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So early the next morning, the brahmins went, and entered by the eastern gate. The Bodhisatta also, washed and anointed, all adorned and rarely arrayed, mounted upon a fine elephant richly caparisoned, came with a great company to the alms-hall at the eastern gate. There he dismounted, and gave food to seven or eight people with his own hand. &ldquo;In this manner give,&rdquo; said he, and mounting his elephant departed to the south gate. At the eastern gate the brahmins had had no chance, owing to the force of the royal guard; so they proceeded to the south, and watched when the king should come. When the king reached a rising ground not far from the gate, they raised their hands, and hailed the king victorious. The king guided his animal with the jewelled goad to the place where they were. &ldquo;Well, brahmins, what is your wish?&rdquo; asked he. Then the brahmins declared the virtues of the Bodhisatta in the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7079"></a><a id="a7080"></a><span class="t12">1. Tava saddhañ-ca sīlañ-ca viditvāna janādhipa,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7081"></a><a id="a7082"></a><a id="a7083"></a><a id="a7084"></a><a id="a7085"></a><a id="a7086"></a><a id="a7087"></a><span class="t12">Vaṇṇaṁ añjanavaṇṇena Kāliṅgasmiṁ nimimhase ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a7088"></a><a id="a7089"></a><span class="t4">Knowing your faith and your virtue, ruler of the people, we did exchange gold in Kaliṅga with the collyrium-coloured one.</span><span class="t47">{2.370}</span></p>
<p class="p23">To this the Bodhisatta made answer, &ldquo;Brahmins, if all your wealth has been exhausted in getting this elephant, never mind &ndash; I give him to you with all his splendour.&rdquo; Thus comforting them, he repeated these two verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7090"></a><a id="a7091"></a><a id="a7092"></a><a id="a7093"></a><span class="t12">2. Annabhaccā cabhaccā ca, yodha uddissa gacchati,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a7097"></a><a id="a7098"></a><a id="a7099"></a><span class="t4">Dependents or non-dependents, he who comes here for my sake, all of them are acceptable, this was my former teachers&rsquo; word.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7100"></a><a id="a7101"></a><a id="a7102"></a><span class="t12">3. Dadāmi vo brāhmaṇā nāgam-etaṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a7106"></a><a id="a7107"></a><a id="a7108"></a><a id="a7109"></a><a id="a7110"></a><a id="a7111"></a><span class="t4">This elephant I give to you, brahmin, suitable, useful for a king, famous, decorated, covered with golden chains, with a driver, go wherever you will.</span><span class="t4"> </span><span class="t47">{2.371}</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus spake the Great Being, mounted upon his elephant&rsquo;s back; then, dismounting, he said to them, &ldquo;If there is a spot on him unadorned, I will adorn it and then give him to you.&rdquo; Thrice he went about the creature, turning towards the right, and examined him; but he found no spot on him without adornment. Then he put the trunk into the brahmins&rsquo; <span class="t18">[2.254] </span>hands; he besprinkled him with scented water from a fine golden vase, and made him over to them. The brahmins accepted the elephant with his belongings, and seating themselves upon his back rode to Dantapura, and handed him over to their king. But although the elephant was come, no rain fell yet.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king asked again, &ldquo;What can be the reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">They said: &ldquo;Dhanañjaya, the Kuru king, observes the Kuru righteousness; therefore in his realms it rains every ten or fifteen days. That is the power of the king&rsquo;s goodness. If in this animal there is any good, how little it must be!&rdquo; Then said the king, &ldquo;Take this elephant, caparisoned as he is, with all his belongings, and give it back to the king. Write upon a golden plate the Kuru righteousness which he observes, and bring it here.&rdquo; With these words he dispatched the brahmins and courtiers.</p>
<p class="p7">These came before the king, and restored his elephant, saying: &ldquo;My lord, even when your elephant came, <span class="t18">{2.372}</span> no rain fell in our country. They say that you observe the Kuru righteousness. Our king is wishful himself to observe it; and he has sent us, bidding us write it upon a golden plate, and bring it to him. Tell us this righteousness!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; says the king, &ldquo;indeed I did once observe this righteousness; but now I am in doubt about this very point. This righteousness does not bless my heart now: therefore I cannot give it you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7112"></a>Why, you may ask, did not virtue bless the king any longer? Well, every third year, in the month of Kattikā<a id="a7113"></a><a href="notes.html#a15338"><span class="t9">{525}</span></a><a id="a7114"></a><a id="a7115"></a> the kings used to hold a festival, called the Kattikā Festival. While keeping this feast, the kings used to deck themselves out in great magnificence, and dress up like gods; they stood in the presence of a Yakkha named Cittarāja [King of Many Colours], and they would shoot to the four points of the compass arrows wreathed in flowers, and painted in divers colours. This king then, in keeping the feast, stood on the bank of a lake, in the presence of Cittarāja, and shot arrows to the four quarters. They could see whither three of the arrows went; but the fourth, which was shot over the water, this they saw not. Thought the king, &ldquo;Perchance the arrow which I have shot has fallen upon some fish!&rdquo; As this doubt arose, the thought of life-taking made a flaw in his virtue; that is why his virtue did not bless him as before. This the king told them; and added, &ldquo;Friends, I am in doubt about myself, whether or no I do observe the Kuru righteousness; but my mother keeps it well. You can get it from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But, O king,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you had no intent to take life. Without the intent of the heart there is no taking of life. Give us the Kuru righteousness which you have kept!&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.255]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Write, then,&rdquo; said he. And he caused them to write upon the plate of gold, &lsquo;Slay not the living; take not what is not given; <span class="t18">{2.373}</span> walk not evily in lust; speak no lies; drink no strong drink.&rsquo; &rdquo;<a id="a7116"></a><a href="notes.html#a15340"><span class="t9">{526}</span></a> Then he added,</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Still, it does not bless me; you had better learn it from my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The messengers saluted the king, and visited the queen-mother. &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;they say you keep the Kuru righteousness: pass it on to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Said the queen-mother, &ldquo;My sons, indeed I did once keep this righteousness, but now I have my doubts. This righteousness does not make me happy, so I cannot give it to you.&rdquo; Now we are told that she had two sons, the elder being king, and the younger viceroy. A certain king sent to the Bodhisatta perfumes of fine sandalwood worth a hundred thousand pieces, and a golden neckband worth a hundred thousand. And he, thinking to do his mother honour, sent the whole to her. Thought she, &ldquo;I do not perfume myself with sandalwood, I do not wear necklets. I will give them to my sons&rsquo; wives.&rdquo; Then the thought occurred to her, &ldquo;My elder son&rsquo;s wife is my lady; she is the chief queen: to her will I give the gold necklet; but the wife of the younger is a poor creature &ndash; to her I will give the sandal perfume.&rdquo; And so to the one she gave the necklet, and the perfume gave she to the other. Afterward she bethought her, &ldquo;I keep the Kuru righteousness; whether they be poor or whether they be not poor is no matter. It is not seemly that I should pay court to the elder. Perchance by not doing this I have made a flaw in my virtue!&rdquo; And she began to doubt; that is why she spoke as she did.</p>
<p class="p7">The messengers said: &ldquo;When it is in your hands, a thing is given even as you will. If you have scruples about a thing so small as that, what other wrong would you ever do? Virtue is not broken by a thing of that kind. <span class="t18">{2.374}</span> Give us the Kuru righteousness!&rdquo; And from her also they received it, and wrote it upon the golden plate.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;All the same, my sons,&rdquo; said the queen-mother, &ldquo;I am not happy in this righteousness. But my daughter-in-law observes it well. Ask her for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So they took their leave respectfully, and asked the daughter in the same way as before. And, as before, she replied, &ldquo;I cannot, for I keep it myself no longer!&rdquo; Now one day as she sat at the lattice window, looking down she saw the king making a solemn procession about the city; and behind him on the elephant&rsquo;s back sat the viceroy. She fell in love with him, and thought: &ldquo;What if I were to strike up a friendship with him, and his brother were to die, and then he were to become king, and take me to wife!&rdquo; Then it flashed across her mind, &ldquo;I who keep the Kuru righteousness, who am married to a husband, I have looked with love <span class="t18">[2.256] </span>upon another man! Here is a flaw in my virtue!&rdquo; Remorse seized upon her. This she told the messengers.</p>
<p class="p7">Then they said: &ldquo;Wrong is not the mere uprising of a thought. If you feel remorse for so small a thing as this, what transgression could you ever commit? Not by such a small matter is virtue broken; give us this righteousness!&rdquo; And she likewise told it to them, and they wrote it upon a golden plate. But she said: &ldquo;However, my sons, my virtue is not perfect. But the viceroy observes these rules well; go you and receive them from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then again they repaired to the viceroy, and as before asked him for the Kuru righteousness. Now the viceroy used to go and pay his devotions to the king at evening; and when they came to the palace courtyard, in his carriage, if he wished to eat with the king, and spend the night there, he would throw his reins and goad upon the yoke; and that was a sign for the people to depart; and next morning early they would come again, and stand awaiting the viceroy&rsquo;s departure. And the charioteer <span class="t18">{2.375}</span> would attend the carriage, and come again with it early in the morning, and wait by the king&rsquo;s door. But if the viceroy would depart at the same time, he left the reins and goad there in the chariot, and went in to wait upon the king. Then the people, taking it for a sign that he would presently depart, stood waiting there at the palace door. One day he did thus, and went in to wait upon the king. But as he was within, it began to rain; and the king, remarking this, would not let him go away, so he took his meal, and slept there. But a great crowd of people stood expecting him to come out, and there they stayed all night in the wet. Next day the viceroy came out, and seeing the crowd standing there drenched, thought he, &ldquo;I, who keep the Kuru righteousness, have put all this crowd to discomfort! Surely here is a flaw in my virtue!&rdquo; and he was seized with remorse. So he said to the messengers, &ldquo;Now doubt has come upon me if indeed I do keep this righteousness; therefore I cannot give it to you,&rdquo; and he told them the matter.</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you never had the wish to plague those people. What is not intended is not counted to one&rsquo;s score. If you feel remorse for so small a thing, in what would you ever transgress?&rdquo; So they received from him too the knowledge of this righteousness, and wrote it on their golden plate. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this righteousness is not perfected in me. But my family priest keeps it well; go, ask him for it.&rdquo; Then again they went on to the family priest.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the family priest one day had been going to wait upon the king. On the road he saw a chariot; sent to the king by another king, coloured like the young sun. &ldquo;Whose chariot is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It is sent for the king,&rdquo; they said. Then he thought: &ldquo;I am an old man; if the king were to give me that chariot, how nice it would be to ride about in it!&rdquo; When he <span class="t18">[2.257] </span>came before the king, and stood by after greeting him with the prayer for prosperity, <a id="a7117"></a><span class="t18">{2.376}</span> they showed the chariot to the king. &ldquo;That is a most beautiful carriage,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;give it to my teacher.&rdquo; But the family priest did not like taking it; no, not though he was begged again and again. Why was this? Because the thought came into his mind, &ldquo;I, who practise the Kuru righteousness, have coveted another&rsquo;s goods. Surely this is a flaw in my virtue!&rdquo; So he told the story to these messengers, adding, &ldquo;My sons, I am in doubt about the Kuru righteousness; this righteousness does not bless me now; therefore I cannot teach it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7118"></a>But the messengers said: &ldquo;Not by mere uprising of covetise is virtue broken. If you feel a scruple in so small a matter, what real transgression would you ever do?&rdquo; And from him also they received the righteousness, and wrote it on their golden plate. &ldquo;Still, this goodness does not bless me now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but the royal driver<a id="a7119"></a><a href="notes.html#a15342"><span class="t9">{527}</span></a> carefully practises it. Go and ask him.&rdquo; So they found the royal driver, and asked him.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the driver one day was measuring a field. Tying a cord to a stick, he gave one end to the owner of the field to hold, and took the other himself. The stick tied to the end of the cord which he held came to a crab&rsquo;s lurk-hole. He thought: &ldquo;If I put the stick in the hole, the crab in the hole will be hurt: if I put it on the other side, the king&rsquo;s property will lose; and if I put it on this side, the farmer will lose. What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; Then he thought again, &ldquo;The crab ought to be in his hole; but if he were, he would show himself,&rdquo; so he put the stick in the hole. The crab made a clicking sound inside. Then he thought: &ldquo;The stick must have struck upon the crab, and it must have killed him! I observe the Kuru righteousness, and now here&rsquo;s a flaw in it!&rdquo; <span class="t18">{2.377}</span> So he told them this, and added, &ldquo;So now I have my doubts about it, and I cannot give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Said the messengers, &ldquo;You had no wish to kill the crab. What is done without intent is not counted to the score; if you feel a scruple about so small a matter, what real transgression would you ever do?&rdquo; And they took the righteousness from his lips likewise, and wrote it on their golden plate. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;though this does not bless me, the charioteer practises it carefully; go and ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So they took their leave, and sought out the charioteer. Now the charioteer one day drove the king into his park in the carriage. There the king took his pleasure during the day, and at evening returned, and entered the chariot. But before he could get back to the city, at the time of sunset a storm cloud arose. The charioteer, fearing the king might get wet, touched up the team with the goad: the steeds sped swiftly home.<span class="t18"> [2.258]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Ever since, going to the park or coming from it, from that spot they went at speed. Why was this? Because they thought there must be some danger at this spot, and that was why the charioteer had touched them with the goad. And the charioteer thought: &ldquo;If the king is wet or dry, &rsquo;tis no fault of mine; but I have given a touch of the goad out of season to these well-trained steeds, and so they run at speed again and again till they are tired, all by my doing. And I observe the Kuru righteousness! Surely there&rsquo;s a flaw in it now!&rdquo; This he told the messengers, and said: &ldquo;For this cause I am in doubt about it, and I cannot give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you did not mean to tire the horses, and what is done without meaning is not set down to the score. If you feel a scruple about so small a matter, what real transgression could you ever commit?&rdquo; And they learned the righteousness from him also, <span class="t18">{2.378}</span> and wrote it down upon their golden plate. But the charioteer sent them in search of a certain wealthy man, saying: &ldquo;Even though this righteousness does not bless me, he keeps it carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So to this rich man they came, and asked him. Now he one day had gone to his paddy field, and seeing a head of rice bursting the husk, went about to tie it up with a wisp of rice; and taking a handful of it, he tied the head to a post. Then it occurred to him, &ldquo;From this field I have yet to give the king his due, and I have taken a handful of rice from an untithed field! I, who observe the rules of Kuru righteousness! Surely I must have broken them!&rdquo; And this matter he told to the messengers, saying: &ldquo;Now I am in doubt about this righteousness, and so I cannot give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7120"></a>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you had no thought of thieving; without this one cannot be proclaimed<a id="a7121"></a><a href="notes.html#a15346"><span class="t9">{528}</span></a><a id="a7122"></a><a id="a7123"></a> guilty of theft. If you feel scruples in such a small matter, when will you ever take what belongs to another man?&rdquo; And from him too they received the righteousness, and wrote it down on their golden plate. He added, &ldquo;Still, though I am not happy in this matter, the Master of the Royal Granaries keeps these rules well. Go, ask him for them.&rdquo; So they betook them to the Master of the Granaries.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7124"></a>Now this man, as he sat one day at the door of the granary, causing the rice of the king&rsquo;s tax to be measured, took a grain from the heap which was not yet measured, and put it down for a marker. At that moment rain began to fall. The official counted up the markers, so many, and then swept them all together and dropped them upon the heap which had been measured. Then he ran in quickly and sat in the gate-house. &ldquo;Did I throw the markers on the measured heap or the unmeasured?&rdquo; he wondered; and the thought came into his mind &ndash; <span class="t18">{2.379}</span> &ldquo;If I threw them on what was already measured, the king&rsquo;s property has been increased, <span class="t18">[2.259] </span>and the owners have lost; I keep the Kuru righteousness; and now here&rsquo;s a flaw!&rdquo; So he told this to the messengers, adding that therefore he had his doubts about it, and could not give it to them.</p>
<p class="p7">But the messengers said: &ldquo;You had no thought of theft, and without this no one can be declared guilty of dishonesty. If you feel scruples in a small matter like this, when would you ever steal any thing belonging to another?&rdquo; And from him too they received the righteousness, and wrote it on their golden plate. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;although this virtue is not perfect in me, there is the gatekeeper, who observes it well: go and get it from him.&rdquo; So they went off and asked the gatekeeper.</p>
<p class="p7">Now it so happened that one day, at the time for closing the city gate, he cried aloud three times. And a certain poor man, who had gone into the woodland gathering sticks and leaves with his youngest sister, hearing the sound came running up with her. Says the door keeper, &ldquo;What! Don&rsquo;t you know that the king is in the city? Don&rsquo;t you know that the gate of this town is shut betimes? Is that why you go out into the woods, making love?&rdquo; Said the other, &ldquo;No, master, it is not my wife, but my sister.&rdquo; Then the porter thought: &ldquo;How unseemly to address a sister as a wife! And I keep the rules of the Kurus; surely I must have broken them now!&rdquo; This he told the messengers, adding, &ldquo;In this way I have my doubts whether I really keep the Kuru righteousness, and so I cannot give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">But they said: &ldquo;You said it because you thought so; <span class="t18">{2.380}</span> this does not break your virtue. If you feel remorse on so slight a cause, how could you ever tell a lie with intent?&rdquo; And so they took down those virtues from him too, and wrote them on their golden plate.</p>
<p class="p7">Then he said: &ldquo;But though this virtue does not bless me, there is a courtesan who keeps it well; go and ask her.&rdquo; And so they did. She refused as the others had done, for the following reason. Sakka, King of the Devas, designed to try her goodness; so putting on the shape of a youth, he gave her a thousand pieces, saying: &ldquo;I will come by and by.&rdquo; Then he returned to heaven, and did not visit her for three years. And she, for honour&rsquo;s sake, for three years took not so much as a piece of betel from another man. By degrees she got poor; and then she thought: &ldquo;The man who gave me a thousand pieces has not come these three years; and now I have grown poor. I cannot keep body and soul together. Now I must go tell the Chief Justices, and get my wage as before.&rdquo; So to the court she came, and said: &ldquo;There was a man three years ago gave me a thousand pieces, and never came back; whether he be dead I know not. I cannot keep body and soul together; what am I to do, my lord&rsquo;?&rdquo; Said he, &ldquo;If he does not come for three years, what can you do? Earn your wage as before.&rdquo; As soon as she left the court, after this award, there came a man who offered her a thousand. As she held out her hands to take it, Sakka showed himself. Said she, &ldquo;Here is the man who gave me <span class="t18">[2.260] </span>a thousand pieces three years ago: I must not take your money,&rdquo; and she drew back her hand. Then Sakka caused his own proper shape to be seen, and hovered in the air, shining like the sun fresh risen, and gathered all the city together. Sakka, in the midst of the crowd, <span class="t18">{2.381}</span> said: &ldquo;To test her goodness I gave her a thousand pieces three years ago. Be like her, and like her keep your honour,&rdquo; and with this admonition, he filled her dwelling with jewels of seven kinds, and saying: &ldquo;Henceforth be vigilant,&rdquo; he comforted her, and went away to heaven. So for this cause she refused, saying: &ldquo;Because before I had earned one wage I held out my hand for another, therefore my virtue is not perfect, and so I cannot give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">To this the messengers replied, &ldquo;Merely to hold out the hand is not a breach of virtue: that virtue of yours is the highest perfection!&rdquo; And from her, as from the rest, they received the rules of virtue, and wrote them on their golden plate. They took it with them to Dantapura, and told the king how they had fared.</p>
<p class="p7">Then their king practised the Kuru precepts, and fulfilled the five precepts. And then in all the realm of Kāliṅga the rain fell; the three fears were allayed; the land became prosperous and fertile. The Bodhisatta all his life long gave alms and did good, and then with his subjects went to fill the heavens.</p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a7133"></a>In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta became a pigeon, and with a large flock of pigeons he lived amidst the woodland in a cave of the hills. There was an ascetic, a virtuous man, who had built himself a hut near a frontier village not far from the place where the pigeons were, and there in a cave of the hills he lived. Him the Bodhisatta visited from time to time, and heard from him things worth hearing.</p>
<p class="p7">After living there a long time, the ascetic went away; and there came a sham ascetic, and lived there. The Bodhisatta, attended by his flock of pigeons, visited him and greeted him respectfully; they spent the day in hopping about the ascetic&rsquo;s abode, and picking up food before the cave, and returned home in the evening. There the sham ascetic lived for more than fifty years.</p>
<p class="p7">One day the villagers gave him some pigeon&rsquo;s flesh which they had cooked. He was taken with the flavour, and asked what it was. &ldquo;Pigeon,&rdquo; said they. He thought: &ldquo;There come flocks of pigeons to my hermitage; I must kill some of them to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So he got rice and ghee, milk and cummin and pepper, and put it by all ready; in a corner of his robe he hid a staff, and sat down at the hut door watching for the pigeons&rsquo; coming.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta came, with his flock, and spied out what wicked thing this sham ascetic would be doing. &ldquo;That wicked ascetic sitting there goes under false pretences! Perhaps he has been feeding on some of our kind; I&rsquo;ll find him out!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So he alighted to leeward, and scented him. <span class="t18">{2.383}</span> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the man wants to kill us and eat us; we must not go near him,&rdquo; and away he flew with his flock. On seeing that he kept aloof, the ascetic thought: &ldquo;I will speak words of honey to him, and make friends, and then kill and eat him!&rdquo; and he uttered the two first verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7134"></a><a id="a7135"></a><span class="t12">1. Vassāni paññāsa samādhikāni, </span></p>

<p class="p23">Then the Bodhisatta stepped back and repeated the third:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7163"></a><span class="t12">3. Jānāma taṁ na mayaṁ sampamūḷhā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7164"></a><a id="a7165"></a><a id="a7166"></a><span class="t12">So yeva tvaṁ te mayam-asma nāññe,</span></p>

<p class="p23">&ldquo;They have found me out!&rdquo; thought the false ascetic. He threw his <span class="t18">[2.262] </span>staff at the bird, but missed him. &ldquo;Get away!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;You have missed us,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;but you shall not miss the four hells! If you stay here, I&rsquo;ll call the villagers and make them catch you for a thief. Run off, quick!&rdquo; Thus he threatened the man, and flew away. The ascetic could live there no longer.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher having ended this discourse, identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time Devadatta was the ascetic; the first ascetic, the good one, was Sāriputta; and the chief of the pigeons was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Why do you patiently.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {2.385}</span><span class="t30"> This story the Teacher told at Jetavana, about a certain impertinent monkey. At Sāvatthi, we are told, was a tame monkey in a certain family; and it ran into the elephant&rsquo;s stable, and perching on the back of a virtuous elephant, voided excrement, and began to walk up and down. The elephant, being both virtuous and patient, did nothing. But one day in this elephant&rsquo;s place stood a wicked young one. The monkey thought it was the same, and climbed upon its back. The elephant seized him in his trunk, and dashing him to the ground, trod him to pieces.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This became known in the meeting of the Saṅgha; and one day they all began to talk about it. &ldquo;Monks, have you heard how the impertinent monkey mistook a bad elephant for a good one, and climbed on his back, and how he lost his life for it?&rdquo; In came the Teacher, and asked, &ldquo;Monks, what are you talking of as you sit here?&rdquo; and they told him. &ldquo;This is not the first time,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that this impertinent monkey behaved so; he did the same before,&rdquo; and he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in the Himālayas region as a buffalo. He grew up strong and big, and ranged the hills and mountains, peaks and caves, tortuous woods a many. Once, as he went, he saw a pleasant tree, and took his food, standing under it. <span class="t18">[2.263]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Then an impertinent monkey came down out of the tree, and getting on his back, voided excrement; then he took hold of one of the buffalo&rsquo;s horns, and swung down from it by his tail, disporting himself. The Bodhisatta, being full of patience, kindness, and sympathy, took no notice at all of his misconduct. This the monkey did again and again.</p>
<p class="p7">But one day, the spirit that belonged to that tree, standing upon the tree-trunk, asked him, saying, <span class="t18">{2.386}</span> &ldquo;My lord buffalo, why do you put up with the rudeness of this bad monkey? Put a stop to him!&rdquo; and enlarging upon this theme he repeated the first two verses as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7186"></a><a id="a7187"></a><a id="a7188"></a><span class="t12">1. Kim-attham-abhisandhāya lahucittassa dubbhino,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><a id="a7198"></a><a id="a7199"></a><a id="a7200"></a><span class="t12">2. Siṅgena nihanāhetaṁ, padasā ca adhiṭṭhaha,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><a id="a7204"></a><a id="a7205"></a><span class="t4">Humiliate him with your horn, and fix him in place with your foot, or more fools might grow angry, and no one will prevent him.</span></p>
<p class="p23">The Bodhisatta, on hearing this, replied, &ldquo;If, Tree Devatā, I cannot endure this monkey&rsquo;s ill-treatment without abusing his birth, lineage, and powers, how can my wish ever come to fulfilment? But the monkey will do the same to any other, thinking him to be like me. And if he does it to any fierce buffaloes, they will destroy him indeed. When some other has killed him, I shall be delivered both from pain and from blood-guiltiness.&rdquo; And saying this he repeated the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7206"></a><a id="a7207"></a><a id="a7208"></a><span class="t12">3. Mamevāyaṁ maññamāno: aññe pevaṁ karissati,</span></p>

<p class="p22"><span class="t4">He&rsquo;s thinking this is me: although he does this to others, they will kill him right there, and there will be freedom for me.</span></p>
<p class="p23">A few days after, the Bodhisatta went elsewhere, and another buffalo, a savage beast, went and stood in his place. The wicked monkey, <span class="t18">{2.387}</span> thinking it to be the old one, climbed upon his back and did as before. The buffalo shook him off upon the ground, and drove his horn into the monkey&rsquo;s heart, and trampled him to mincemeat under his hoofs.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this teaching, he declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the bad buffalo was he who now is the bad elephant, the bad monkey was the same, but the virtuous noble buffalo was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the group of six monks try to prevent others from correcting them in matters of Dhamma and Vinaya.

Of the Group of Six, two &ndash; Mettiya and Bhummaja &ndash; lived nearby Rājagaha; two, Assaji and Punabbasu, near Kīṭāgiri, and at Jetavana near Sāvatthi the two others, Paṇḍuka and Lohita. They questioned matters laid down in the Dhamma; whoever were their friends and intimates, they would encourage, saying: &ldquo;You are no worse than these, brother, in birth, lineage, or character; if you give up your opinions, they will have much the better of you,&rdquo; and by saying this kind of thing they prevented their giving up their opinions, and thus strifes and quarrels and contentions arose.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks told this to the Fortunate One. The Fortunate One assembled the monks for that cause, to make explanation; and causing Paṇḍuka and Lohita to be summoned, addressed them, &ldquo;Is it true, monks, that you really yourselves question certain matters, and prevent people from giving up their opinions?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they replied. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your behaviour is like that of the man and the crane,&rdquo; and he told them a story.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past, when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born to a certain family in a Kāsi village. When he grew up, instead of earning a livelihood by farming or trade, <span class="t18">{2.388}</span> he gathered five hundred robbers, and became their chief, and lived by highway robbery and housebreaking.</p>
<p class="p7">Now it so happened that a landowner had given a thousand pieces of money to someone, and died before receiving it back again.</p>
<p class="p7">Some time after, his wife lay on her deathbed, and addressing her son, said: &ldquo;Son, your father gave a thousand pieces of money to a man, and died without getting it back; if I die too, he will not give it to you. Go, while I yet live, get him to fetch it and give it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">So the son went, and got the money.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7218"></a>The mother died; but she loved her son so much, that she suddenly reappeared<a id="a7219"></a><a href="notes.html#a15350"><span class="t9">{530}</span></a> as a jackal on the road by which he was coming. At that time, the robber chief with his band lay by the road in wait to plunder travellers. And when her son had got to the entrance of the wood, the jackal returned again and again, and sought to stay him; saying: &ldquo;My son, don&rsquo;t enter the wood! There are robbers there, who will slay you and take your money!&rdquo; <span class="t18">[2.265]</span></p>
<p class="p7">But the man understood not what she meant. &ldquo;Ill luck!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a jackal trying to stop my way!&rdquo; he said; and he drove her off with sticks and clods, and into the wood he went.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7220"></a>And a woodpecker<a id="a7221"></a><a href="notes.html#a15352"><span class="t9">{531}</span></a> flew towards the robbers, crying out, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a man with a thousand pieces in his hand! Kill him, and take them!&rdquo; The young fellow did not know what it was doing, so he thought: &ldquo;Good luck! Here&rsquo;s a lucky bird! Now there is a good omen for me!&rdquo; He saluted respectfully, crying, &ldquo;Give voice, give voice, my lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a7222"></a>The Bodhisatta, who knew the meaning of all sounds, observed what these two did, and thought: &ldquo;That jackal must be the man&rsquo;s mother; so she tries to stop him, and tell him that he will be killed and robbed; but the woodpecker must be some adversary, and that is why it says &lsquo;Kill him, and take the money;&rsquo; and the man does not know what is happening, <span class="t18">{2.389}</span> and drives off his mother, who wishes his welfare, while the woodpecker, who wishes him ill, he worships, under the belief that it is a well-wisher. The man is a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">(Now the Bodhisattas, even though they are great beings, sometimes take the goods of others by being born as wicked men; this they say comes from a fault in the horoscope.)</p>
<p class="p7">So the young man went on, and by and by fell in with the robbers. The Bodhisatta caught him, and, &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;In Benares.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; &ldquo;There was a thousand pieces due to me in a certain village; and that is where I have been.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you get it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who sent you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Teacher, my father is dead, and my mother is ill; it was she sent me, because she thought I should not get it if she were dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;And do you know what has happened to your mother now?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;She died after you left; and so much did she love you, that she at once became a jackal, and kept trying to stop you for fear you should get killed. She it was that you scared away. But the woodpecker was an enemy, who came and told us to kill you, and take your money. You are such a fool that you thought your mother was an ill-wisher, when she wished you well, and thought the woodpecker was a well-wisher when it wished ill to you. He did you no good, but your mother was very good to you. Keep your money, and be off!&rdquo; And he let him go. <span class="t18">[2.266]</span></p>
<p class="p7">When the Teacher had finished this discourse, he repeated the following verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7223"></a><a id="a7224"></a><a id="a7225"></a><a id="a7226"></a><span class="t12">1. Yathā māṇavako panthe siṅgāliṁ vanagocariṁ,</span></p>

<p class="p13"><a id="a7264"></a><a id="a7265"></a><a id="a7266"></a><a id="a7267"></a><span class="t12">1. Addhā hi nūna migarājā puṭakammassa kovido,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7268"></a><span class="t12">Tathā hi puṭaṁ dūseti, aññaṁ nūna karissatī ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a7269"></a><a id="a7270"></a><a id="a7271"></a><a id="a7272"></a><span class="t4">Certainly the king of beasts is skilled in making baskets, therefore he does spoil the basket, he surely will make another.</span></p>
<p class="p23">On hearing this the monkey repeated the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7273"></a><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Na me mātā vā pitā vā puṭakammassa kovido,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Kataṁ kataṁ kho dūsema, evaṁ dhammam-idaṁ kulan-ti.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a7274"></a><span class="t4">&ldquo;Neither my mother or my father are skilled in making baskets, having made baskets we spoil them, such is our clan&rsquo;s character.&rdquo; </span><span class="t47">{2.392}</span></p>
<p class="p23">And the Bodhisatta responded with the third:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7275"></a><a id="a7276"></a><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Yesaṁ vo ediso dhammo, adhammo pana kīdiso?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a7277"></a><a id="a7278"></a><span class="t12">Mā vo dhammaṁ adhammaṁ vā addasāma kudācanan-ti!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">&ldquo;For whoever such is natural, what would be unnatural? Don&rsquo;t let me see your natural or unnatural any time!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p23">With these words of blame he departed.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher had ended this discourse, he identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the monkey was the boy who has been destroying the baskets; but the wise man was I myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
