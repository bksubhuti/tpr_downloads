<h4 class="h40">The Battle of the Two Wise Men</h4>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13845"></a>After this time he used to instruct the king in things temporal and spiritual: and he thought: &ldquo;I am indeed the king&rsquo;s white parasol; it is I who manage the kingdom: <span class="t18">{6.390}</span><a id="a13846"></a><a id="a13847"></a> I must therefore be vigilant.&rdquo; He caused a great rampart to be built for the city. Along the rampart were watchtowers at the gates, and between the watch-towers he dug three moats &ndash; a water-moat, a mud-moat, and a dry-moat. Within the city he caused all the old houses to be restored: large banks were dug and he made reservoirs for water; all the storehouses were filled with corn. All the family priests had to bring down from the Himālayas mud and edible lily-seeds. The water conduits were cleaned out, and the old houses outside were also restored. This was done as a defence against future dangers.</p>
<p class="p7">Merchants who came from one place or another were asked whence they came; and on their replying, they were asked what their king liked; when this was <span class="t18">[6.198] </span>told, they were kindly treated before they went away. Then he sent for a hundred and one soldiers and said to them, &ldquo;My men, take these gifts to the hundred and one royal cities, and give them to their several kings to please them: live there in their service, listen to their actions and plans, and send me word. I will care for your wives and children.&rdquo; And he sent with them earrings for some, and golden slippers for others, and golden necklets for others, with letters engraved upon them, which he appointed to reveal themselves when it should suit his purpose. The men went this way and that, and gave these gifts to the kings, saying that they were come to live in their service. When asked whence they came, they told the names of other places than that from which they had really come. Their offer accepted, they remained there in attendance, and made themselves to be trusted.</p>
<p class="p7">Now in the kingdom of Ekabala was a king named Saṅkhapāla, who was collecting arms and assembling an army. The man who had come to him sent a message to the sage, saying: &ldquo;This is the news here, but what he intends I know not; send and find out the truth of the matter.&rdquo; Then the Great Being called a parrot and said: &ldquo;Friend, go and find out what king Saṅkhapāla is doing in Ekabala, <span class="t18">{6.391}</span><a id="a13848"></a> then travel over all Jambudīpa and bring me the news.&rdquo; He fed it with honey and grain, and gave it sweet water to drink, anointed the joints of the wings with oil a hundred and a thousand times refined, stood by the eastern window, and let it go. The parrot went to the man aforesaid and found out the truth.</p>
<p class="p7">As he passed back through Jambudīpa he came to Uttarapañcāla city in the kingdom of Kampilla. There was reigning a king named Cullaṇī Brahmadatta, who had for spiritual and temporal adviser a brahmin Kevaṭṭa, wise and learned. The brahmin one morning awoke at dawn, and looking by the light of the lamp upon his magnificent chamber, as he regarded its splendour, thought: &ldquo;To whom does this splendour belong? To no one but to Cullaṇī Brahmadatta. A king who gives splendour like this ought to be the chief king in all Jambudīpa, and I will be his family priest-in-chief.&rdquo; And so early in the morning he went to the king, and when he had enquired whether he had slept well, he said: &ldquo;My lord, there is something I wish to say.&rdquo; &ldquo;Say on, teacher.&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, a secret cannot be told in the town, let us go into the park.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The king went to the park with him, and left the retinue without, and set a guard, and entered the park with the brahmin, and sat down upon the royal seat. The parrot, seeing this, thought that there must be something afoot, &ldquo;Today I shall hear something which must be sent to my wise master.&rdquo; So he flew into the park, and perched amid the leaves of the royal Sāl tree. The king said: &ldquo;Speak on, teacher.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Sire, bend your ear this way; this is a plan for four ears only. If, sire, you will do what I advise, I will make you chief king in all Jambudīpa.&rdquo; The king heard him greedily, and answered <span class="t18">[6.199] </span>well pleased, &ldquo;Tell me, my teacher, and I will do it.&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, let us raise an army, and first besiege a small city. Then I will enter the city by a back gate, and will say to the king, &lsquo;Sire, there is no use in your fighting: just be our man; your kingdom you may keep, but if you fight with our mighty force, <span class="t18">{6.392}</span><a id="a13849"></a> you will be utterly conquered.&rsquo; If he does<a id="a13850"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17669"><span class="t9">{1641}</span></a> what I advise, we will receive him; if not, we will fight and kill him, and with two armies go and take another city, and then another, and in this way we shall gain dominion over all Jambudīpa and drink the cup of victory. Then we will bring the hundred and one kings to our city, and make a drinking booth in the park, and seat them there, and provide them with poisoned liquor, and so kill them all and cast them into the Ganges. Thus we will get the hundred and one royal capitals into our hands, and you will become chief king of all Jambudīpa.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well, my teacher,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will do so.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, this plan is for four ears only, no one else must know of it. Make no delay but set forth at once.&rdquo; The king was pleased with this advice and resolved to do so.</p>
<p class="p7">The parrot which had overheard all their conversation let fall on Kevaṭṭa&rsquo;s head a lump of dung as though it dropped from a twig. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried he, looking upwards with mouth gaping wide: whereupon the bird dropped another into his mouth and flew off crying out, &ldquo;Cree cree! O Kevaṭṭa, you think your plan is for four ears only, but now it is for six; by and by it will be for eight ears and for hundreds of them!&rdquo; &ldquo;Catch him, catch him!&rdquo; they cried; but swift as the wind he flew to Mithilā and entered the wise man&rsquo;s house. </p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13851"></a>Now the parrot&rsquo;s custom was this: If news from any place was for the sage&rsquo;s ears alone, he would perch on his shoulder; if queen Amarā was also to hear it, he perched on his lap; if the company might hear it, upon the ground. This time he perched on the shoulder, and at that sign the company retired, knowing it to be secret. The sage took him up to the top storey and asked him, &ldquo;Well, my dear, what have you seen, what have you heard?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;My lord, in no other king of all Jambudīpa have I seen any danger; but only Kevaṭṭa, family priest to Cullaṇī Brahmadatta in the city of Uttarapañcāla, took his king into the park and told him a plan for their four ears: I was sitting amidst the branches and dropped a ball of dung in his mouth, and here I am!&rdquo; Then he told the sage all he had seen and heard. <span class="t18">{6.393}</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Did the king agree to it?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; said the parrot. So the sage tended the bird as was fitting, and put him in his golden cage strewn with soft rugs. He thought to himself, &ldquo;Kevaṭṭa I think does not know that I am the wise Mahosadha. I will not allow him to accomplish his plan.&rdquo; Then he removed outside all the poor people who lived in the city, and he brought from all the kingdom, the countryside, and the suburb villages, and settled within <span class="t18">[6.200] </span>the city the rich families of the powerful, and he gathered great quantities of corn.</p>
<p class="p7">And Cullaṇī Brahmadatta did as Kevaṭṭa had proposed: he went with his army and laid siege to a city. Kevaṭṭa, as he had suggested, went into the city and explained matters to the king and won him over. Then joining the two armies Cullaṇī Brahmadatta followed Kevaṭṭa&rsquo;s advice and went on to another kingdom, until he had brought all the kings of Jambudīpa under his power except king Vedeha. The men provided by the Bodhisatta kept on sending messages to say, &ldquo;Brahmadatta has taken such and such towns, be on your guard,&rdquo; to which he replied, &ldquo;I am on my guard here, be watchful yourselves without remissness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">In seven years and seven months and seven days Brahmadatta gained possession of all Jambudīpa, excepting Vedeha. Then he said to Kevaṭṭa, &ldquo;Teacher, let us seize the empire of Vedeha at Mithilā!&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we shall never be able to get possession of the city where wise Mahosadha lives: he is full of this sort of knowledge, having skill in means.&rdquo; Then he expatiated on the virtue of the Great Being, as though he drew it on the disk of the moon. Now he himself had skill in means, so he said: &ldquo;The kingdom of Mithilā is very small, and the dominion of all Jambudīpa is enough for us.&rdquo; Thus he consoled the king; but the other princes said: &ldquo;No, we will take the kingdom of Mithilā and drink the cup of victory!&rdquo; Kevaṭṭa would have stayed them, saying: &ldquo;What good will it be to take Vedeha&rsquo;s kingdom? That king is our man already. Come back.&rdquo; Such was his counsel: they listened to him and turned back. The Great Being&rsquo;s men sent him word that Brahmadatta with a hundred and one kings on his way to Mithilā turned back <span class="t18">{6.394}</span> and went to his own city. He sent word in answer, that they were to observe what he did.</p>
<p class="p7">Now Brahmadatta deliberated with Kevaṭṭa what was next to do. Hoping to drink the cup of victory, they adorned the park, and told the servants to set out wine in thousands of jars, to prepare fish and flesh of all sorts. This news also the sage&rsquo;s men sent to him. Now they did not know of the plan to poison the kings, but the Great Being knew it from what the parrot had told him; he sent a message to them accordingly, that they should inform him of the day fixed for this festival, and they did so.</p>
<p class="p7">Then he thought: &ldquo;It is not right that so many kings should be killed while a wise man like myself lives. I will help them.&rdquo; He sent for ten thousand warriors, his birth-fellows, and said: &ldquo;Friends, on such a day Cullaṇī Brahmadatta, they tell me, wishes to adorn his park and to drink wine with the hundred and one kings. Go you there, and before anyone sits on the seats provided for the kings, take possession of the seat of honour next to Cullaṇī Brahmadatta, saying, &lsquo;This is for our king&rsquo;. When they ask whose men you are, tell them king Vedeha&rsquo;s. They will make a great outcry and say, &lsquo;What! For seven years and seven months <span class="t18">[6.201] </span>and seven days we have been conquering kingdoms, and not once did we see your king Vedeha! What king is he? Go find him a seat at the end!&rsquo; You must then squabble and say, &lsquo;Except Brahmadatta, no king is above our king! If we cannot get even a seat for our king we will not let you eat or drink now!&rsquo; So shouting and jumping about, terrify them with the noise, break all the pots with your great clubs, scatter the food, and make it unfit to eat, rush amongst the crowd at the top of your speed, and make a din like Asuras invading the city of the gods, calling aloud, &lsquo;We are the wise Mahosadha&rsquo;s men of Mithilā city: catch us if you can!&rsquo; Thus show them that you are there, and then return to me.&rdquo; They promised to obey, <span class="t18">{6.395}</span> and took their leave; and, armed with the five weapons, set off. They entered the decorated park like Nandana Grove, and beheld all its magnificent array, the seats placed for the hundred and one kings, the white parasols outspread, and all the rest. They did all as directed by the Great Being, and after causing confusion amongst the crowd they returned to Mithilā.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13852"></a>The king&rsquo;s men told him what had happened: Brahmadatta was angry, that such a fine plan to poison the princes had failed; while the princes were angry, because they had been deprived of the cup of victory; and the soldiers were angry, because they had lost the chance of free drink. So Brahmadatta said to the princes, &ldquo;Come, friends, let us go to Mithilā, and cut off king Vedeha&rsquo;s head with the sword, and trample it underfoot, and then come back and drink the cup of victory! Go tell your armies to get them ready.&rdquo; Then going apart with Kevaṭṭa, he told him about it, saying: &ldquo;See, we shall capture the enemy who has threatened this fine plan. With the hundred and one princes and the eighteen complete armies we shall assail that town. Come, my teacher!&rdquo; But the brahmin was wise enough to know that they could never capture the sage Mahosadha, but all they would get would be disgrace; the king must be dissuaded. So he said: &ldquo;Sire! This king of Vedeha has no strength; the management is in the hands of the sage Mahosadha, and he is very powerful. Guarded by him, as a lion guards his den, Mithilā can be taken by none. We shall only be disgraced: do not think of going.&rdquo; But the king, mad with soldier&rsquo;s pride and the intoxication of empire, cried out, &ldquo;What will he do!&rdquo; and departed, with the hundred and one princes and the eighteen complete armies.<a id="a13853"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17671"><span class="t9">{1642}</span></a> Kevaṭṭa, unable to persuade him to take his advice, and thinking that it was of no use to thwart him, went with him.</p>
<p class="p7">But those warriors came to Mithilā in one night, and told the sage all that had passed. And the men whom he had before sent into service sent him word, that Cullaṇī Brahmadatta was on his way with the hundred and one kings to take king Vedeha; he must be vigilant. The messages <span class="t18">[6.202] </span>came one after another, &ldquo;Today he is in such a place, <span class="t18">{6.396}</span> today in such a place, today he will reach the city.&rdquo; On hearing this the Great Being redoubled his care. And king Vedeha heard it noised about on all sides that Brahmadatta was on his way to take the city.</p>
<p class="p7">Now Brahmadatta in the early evening surrounded the city by the light of a hundred thousand torches. He girdled it with fences of elephants and of chariots and of horses, and at regular intervals placed a mass of soldiers: there stood the men, shouting, snapping their fingers, roaring, dancing, crying aloud. With the light of the torches and the sheen of the armour the whole city of Mithilā in its seven leagues was one blaze of light, the noise of elephants and horses, of chariots, and men made the very earth to crack. The four wise men, hearing the waves of sound and not knowing what it should be, went to the king and said: &ldquo;Sire, there is a great din, and we know not what it is: will the king enquire?&rdquo; Hereat the king thought: &ldquo;No doubt Brahmadatta is come,&rdquo; and he opened a window, and looked out. When he saw that he was indeed come, the king was dismayed, and said to them, &ldquo;We are dead men! Tomorrow he will kill us all doubtless!&rdquo; So they sat talking together. But when the Great Being saw that he had come, fearless as a lion he set guards in all the city, and then went up into the palace to encourage the king. Greeting him, he stood on one side. The king was encouraged to see him, and thought: &ldquo;There is no one who can save me from this trouble except the wise Mahosadha!&rdquo; and he addressed him as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">84.</span><a id="a13854"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17673"><span class="t19">{1643}</span></a><span class="t12"> &ldquo;Brahmadatta of Pañcāla has come with all his host; this army of Pañcāla is infinite, O Mahosadha!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">85-86. Men with burdens on their backs,</span><a id="a13855"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17675"><span class="t19">{1644}</span></a><span class="t12"> foot-soldiers, men skilful in fight, men ready to destroy, a great din, the noise of drums and conchs, here is all skill in the use of steel weapons, here are banners and knights in mail, accomplished warriors and heroes!</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13856"></a><span class="t12">87. Ten sages are here, profound in wisdom, secret in stratagem, and eleventh, the mother of the king</span><a id="a13857"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17677"><span class="t19">{1645}</span></a><span class="t12"> encouraging </span><span class="t18">[6.203] </span><span class="t12">the host of Pañcāla. </span><span class="t18">{6.397}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">88. Here are a hundred and one warrior-princes in attendance, their kingdoms reft from them, terror-stricken and overcome by the men of Pañcāla.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">89. What they profess that they do for the king; they are those who speak fair; with Pañcāla they go perforce, being in his power.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13858"></a><span class="t12">90. Mithilā the royal city is surrounded by this host arrayed with three intervals,</span><a id="a13859"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17679"><span class="t19">{1646}</span></a><span class="t12"> digging about it on all sides.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">91. It is surrounded as it were by stars on all sides. Think, Mahosadha! How shall deliverance come?&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.398}</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the Great Being heard this, he thought: &ldquo;This king is terribly in fear of his life. The sick man&rsquo;s refuge is the physician, <span class="t18">{6.399} </span>the hungry man&rsquo;s is food, and drink the thirsty man&rsquo;s, but I and I alone am his refuge. I will console him.&rdquo; Then, like a lion roaring upon the plains of Manosilā, he cried, &ldquo;Fear not, sire, but enjoy your royal power. As I would scare a crow with a clod, or a monkey with a bow, I will scatter that mighty host, and leave them not so much as a waistcloth of their own.&rdquo; And he recited this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">92. &ldquo;Stretch out your feet, eat and be merry: Brahmadatta shall leave the host of Pañcāla and flee away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">After encouraging the king, the wise man came out and caused the drums of festival to beat about the city, with a proclamation, &ldquo;Oyez! Have no fear. Procure garlands, scents, and perfumes, food and drink, and keep seven days&rsquo; holiday. Let the people stay where they will, drink deep, sing and dance and make merry, shout and cheer and snap their fingers: all be at my cost. I am the wise Mahosadha: behold my power!&rdquo; Thus he encouraged the townsfolk. They did so: and those without heard the sound of singing and music. Men came in by the back gate.</p>
<p class="p7">Now it was not their way to arrest strangers at sight, except a foe; so the access was not closed. These men therefore saw the people taken up with merrymaking. And Cullaṇī Brahmadatta heard the noise in the town, and said to his courtiers, &ldquo;Look you, we have encompassed this city with eighteen great hosts, and the people show neither <span class="t18">[6.204] </span>fear nor anxiety: but full of delight and happiness they snap fingers, they make merry, they leap and sing. What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the men sent previously to foreign service spoke falsely as follows, &ldquo;My lord, we entered the city by the back gate on some business, and seeing the people all taken up in merrymaking we asked, <span class="t18">{6.400}</span> &lsquo;Why are you so careless when all the kings of Jambudīpa are here besieging your city?&rsquo; And they replied, &lsquo;When our king was a boy he had a wish to hold festival when all the kings of Jambudīpa should have besieged the city; and now that wish is fulfilled: therefore he sent round a proclamation, and himself keeps festival in the palace.&rsquo; &rdquo; This made the king angry; and he sent out a division of his army with these orders, &ldquo;Disperse all about the city, fill up the trenches, break down the walls, raze the gate-towers, enter the city, use the people&rsquo;s heads like pumpkins cast on a cart, and bring me here the head of king Vedeha.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13860"></a>Then the mighty warriors, armed with all manner of weapons, marched up to the gate, assisted by the sage&rsquo;s men with red-hot missiles,<a id="a13861"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17681"><span class="t9">{1647}</span></a> showers of mud, and stones thrown upon them. When they were in the ditch attempting to destroy the wall, the men in the gate-towers dealt havoc with arrows, javelins, and spears. The sage&rsquo;s men mocked and jeered at the men of Brahmadatta, with gestures and signs of the hands, and crying, &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t take us, have a bite or a sup, do!&rdquo; and holding out bowls of toddy and skewers with meat or fish, which they ate and drank themselves, they promenaded atop the walls.</p>
<p class="p7">The others quite unsuccessful returned to Cullaṇī Brahmadatta, and said: &ldquo;My lord, no one but a magician could get in.&rdquo; The king waited four or five days, not seeing how to take what he wanted to take. Then he asked Kevaṭṭa, &ldquo;Teacher, take the city we cannot, not a man can get near it! What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind, your majesty. The city gets water from outside, we will cut off the water and so take it. They will be worn out for want of water, and will open the gates.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is the plan,&rdquo; said the king. After that, they hindered the people from getting near the water.</p>
<p class="p7">The wise man&rsquo;s spies wrote on a leaf, and fastened it on an arrow, and so sent word to him. Now he had already given orders, that whosoever sees a leaf fastened upon an arrow <span class="t18">{6.401}</span> was to bring it to him. A man saw this, and took it to the sage, who read the message. &ldquo;He knows not that I am the sage Mahosadha,&rdquo; he thought. Procuring bamboo poles sixty cubits long, he had them split in two, the knots removed, and then joined again, covered over with leather, and smeared with mud. He then sent for the soil and lily-seed brought from the Himālayas by the ascetics, he planted the seed in the mud by the edge of the tank, and placed the bamboo over it, and filled it with water. In one night it grew up and flowered, rising a fathom above the top of the <span class="t18">[6.205] </span>bamboo. Then he pulled it up and gave it to his men with orders to take it to Brahmadatta.</p>
<p class="p7">They rolled up the stalk, and threw it over the wall, crying out, &ldquo;Ho servants of Brahmadatta! Don&rsquo;t starve for want of food. Here you are, wear the flower and fill your bellies with the stalk!&rdquo; One of the wise man&rsquo;s spies picked it up, and brought it to the king, and said: &ldquo;See, your majesty, the stalk of this lily: never was so long a stalk seen before!&rdquo; &ldquo;Measure it,&rdquo; said the king. They measured it and made it out to be eighty fathoms instead of sixty. The king asked, &ldquo;Where did that grow?&rdquo; One replied with a made-up tale, &ldquo;One day, my lord, being thirsty for a little toddy, I went into the city by the back gate, and I saw the great tanks made for the people to play in. There was a number of people in a boat plucking flowers. That was where this grew by the edge of the tank; but those which grew in the deep water would be a hundred cubits high.&rdquo; Hearing this the king said to Kevaṭṭa, &ldquo;Teacher, we cannot take them by cutting off the water; make an end of that attempt.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;then we will take them by cutting off their food; the city gets its food from outside.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good, teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The sage learned this as before, and thought: &ldquo;He does not know that I am the sage Mahosadha!&rdquo; Along the rampart he laid mud and there planted rice. Now the wishes of the Bodhisattas always succeed: in one night the rice sprang up and showed over the top of the rampart. <span class="t18">{6.402}</span> This Brahmadatta saw, and asked, &ldquo;Friend, what is that which shows green above the rampart?&rdquo; A scout of the sage&rsquo;s replied, as though catching the words from the king&rsquo;s lips, &ldquo;My lord, Mahosadha the farmer&rsquo;s son, foreseeing danger to come, collected from all the realm grain with which he filled his granaries, throwing out the residue upon the ramparts. No doubt this rice, warmed with the heat and soaked in the rain, grew up there into plants. I myself one day went in by the back gate on some business, and picked up a handful of this rice from a heap on the rampart, and dropped it in the street; whereupon the people laughed at me, and cried, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re hungry, it seems! Tie up some of it in the corner of your robe, take it home, and cook it and eat it.&rdquo; Hearing this, the king said to Kevaṭṭa, &ldquo;Teacher, by cutting off the grain we shall not take this place; that is not the way.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, my lord, we will take it by cutting off the supply of wood, which the city gets from without.&rdquo; &ldquo;So be it, teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta as before got to know of it; and he built a heap of firewood which showed beyond the rice. The people laughed at Brahmadatta&rsquo;s men, and said: &ldquo;If you are hungry, here is something to cook your food with,&rdquo; throwing down great logs of wood as they said it. The king asked, &ldquo;What is this firewood showing above the rampart?&rdquo; The scouts said: &ldquo;The farmer&rsquo;s son, foreseeing danger to come, collected firewood, and stored it in the sheds behind the houses; what was over he stacked by the rampart side.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then the king said to Kevaṭṭa, &ldquo;Teacher, we cannot take <span class="t18">[6.206] </span>the place by cutting off the wood; enough of that plan.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind, sire, I have another plan.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is that plan, teacher? I see no end to your plans. Videha we cannot take; let us go back to our city.&rdquo; My lord, if it is said that Cullaṇī Brahmadatta with a hundred and one princes could not take Videha, we shall be disgraced. Mahosadha is not the only wise man, for I am another: I will use a stratagem.&rdquo; &ldquo;What stratagem, teacher?&rdquo; &ldquo;We will have a Battle of the Dhamma.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{6.403}</span> &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, no army shall fight. The two sages of the two kings shall appear in one place, and of these whichever shall salute the other shall be conquered. Mahosadha does not know this idea. I am older and he is younger, and when he sees me he will salute me. Thus we shall conquer Vedeha, and this done we will return home. So we shall not be disgraced. That is what is meant by a Battle of the Dhamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">But the Bodhisatta learned this secret as before. &ldquo;If I let Kevaṭṭa conquer me thus,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I am no sage.&rdquo; Brahmadatta said: &ldquo;A capital plan,&rdquo; and he wrote a letter and sent it to Vedeha by the back gate, to this effect, &ldquo;Tomorrow there shall be a Battle of the Dhamma between the two sages; and he who shall refuse to fight shall be accounted vanquished.&rdquo; On receipt of this Vedeha sent for the sage and told him. He answered, &ldquo;Good, my lord: send word to prepare a place for the Battle of the Dhamma by the western gate, and there to assemble. So he gave a letter to the messenger, and next day they prepared the place for the Battle of the Dhamma to see the defeat of Kevaṭṭa. But the hundred and one princes, not knowing what might befall, surrounded Kevaṭṭa to protect him. These princes went to the place prepared, and stood looking towards the east, and there also was the sage Kevaṭṭa.</p>
<p class="p7">But early in the morning, the Bodhisatta bathed in sweet-scented water, and clothed himself in a Kāsi robe worth a hundred thousand pieces, and adorned himself fully, and after a dainty breakfast went with a great following to the palace-gate. Bidden to enter, he did so, and greeted the king, and sat down on one side. &ldquo;Well, sage Mahosadha?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;I am going to the place of the Battle.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what am I to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, I wish to conquer Kevaṭṭa with a gem; I must have the eight-sided gem.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take it, my son.&rdquo; He took it, and took his leave, and surrounded by the thousand warriors, his birthmates, <span class="t18">{6.404}</span> he entered the noble chariot drawn by a team of white thoroughbreds, worth ninety thousand pieces of money, and at the time of the midday meal he came to the gate.</p>
<p class="p7">Kevaṭṭa stood watching for his arrival, and saying: &ldquo;Now he comes, now he comes,&rdquo; craning his neck till it seemed to be lengthened, and sweating in the heat of the sun. The Great Being, with his retinue, like an inundating sea, like a roused lion, fearless and unruffled, caused the gate to be opened and came forth from the city; descending from his <span class="t18">[6.207] </span>chariot like a lion aroused, he went forward.</p>
<p class="p7">The hundred and one princes beholding his majesty, acclaimed him with thousands of cries, &ldquo;Here is the sage Mahosadha, son of Sirivaḍḍha, who hath no peer for wisdom in all Jambudīpa!&rdquo; And he, like Sakka surrounded with his troop of gods, in glory and grandeur unparalleled, holding in his hand the precious gem, stood before Kevaṭṭa. And Kevaṭṭa at first sight of him had not force to stand still, but advanced to meet him, and said: &ldquo;Sage Mahosadha, we are sages both, and although I have been dwelling near you all this time, you have never yet sent me so much as a gift. Why is this?&rdquo; The Great Being said: &ldquo;Wise sir, I was looking for a gift which should be not unworthy of you, and today I have found this gem. Pray take it; there is not its like in the world.&rdquo; The other seeing the gem ablaze in his hand, thought that he must be desiring to offer it, and said: &ldquo;Give it me then,&rdquo; holding out his hand. &ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; said the Great Being, and dropped it upon the tips of the fingers of his outstretched hand. But the brahmin could not support the weight of the gem in his fingers, and it slipped down and rolled to the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s feet; the brahmin in his greed to get it, stooped down to the other&rsquo;s feet. Then the Great Being would not let him rise, but with one hand held his shoulderblades and with the other his loins, as he cried, &ldquo;Rise teacher, rise, I am younger than you, young enough to be your grandson; do no obeisance to me.&rdquo; As he said this again and again, he rubbed his face and forehead against the ground, till it was all bloody, then with the words, &ldquo;Blind fool, did you think to have an obeisance from me?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{6.405}</span> he caught him by the throat and threw him away from himself. He fell twenty fathoms away; then got up and ran off.</p>
<p class="p7">Then the Great Being&rsquo;s men picked up the gem, but the echo of the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Rise up, rise, do no obeisance to me!&rdquo; rose above the din of the crowd. All the people shouted aloud with one voice, &ldquo;Brahmin Kevaṭṭa did obeisance to the sage&rsquo;s feet!&rdquo; And the kings, Brahmadatta and all, saw Kevaṭṭa bow before the feet of the Great Being. &ldquo;Our sage,&rdquo; they thought, &ldquo;has done obeisance to the Great Being; now we are conquered! He will make an end of us all,&rdquo; and each mounting his horse they began to flee away to Uttarapañcāla. The Bodhisatta&rsquo;s men seeing them flee, again made a clamour, crying, &ldquo;Cullaṇī Brahmadatta is in flight with his hundred and one princes!&rdquo; Hearing this, the princes terrified more and more, ran on and scattered the great host; while the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s men, shouting and yelling, made a yet louder din.</p>
<p class="p7">The Great Being with his retinue returned to the city; while Brahmadatta&rsquo;s army ran in rout for three leagues. Kevaṭṭa mounted upon a horse came up with the army wiping off the blood from his forehead, and cried, &ldquo;Ho there, do not run! I did not bow to the churl! Stop, stop!&rdquo; But the army would not stop, and made mock of Kevaṭṭa, reviling him, &ldquo;Bad man! Villain brahmin! You would make a Battle of the Dhamma, and then <span class="t18">[6.208] </span>bow before a stripling young enough to be your grandson! Is not this a thing most unmeet for you!&rdquo; They would not listen to him, but went on. He dashed on into the army, and cried, &ldquo;Ho you, you must believe me, I did not bow to him, he tricked me with a gem!&rdquo; So by one means or another, he convinced the princes and made them believe him, and rallied the broken army.</p>
<p class="p7">Now so great was this host, that if each man of them had taken a clod or a handful of earth and thrown it into the moat, they could have filled the moat and made a heap as high as the rampart. But we know that the intentions of the Bodhisattas are fulfilled; and there was not one who threw a clod or a handful of earth towards the city. They all returned back to their position. <span class="t18">{6.406}</span> Then the king asked Kevaṭṭa, &ldquo;What are we to do, teacher?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, let no one come out from the back gate, and cut off all access. The people unable to come out will be discouraged and will open the gate. Thus we shall capture our enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13862"></a>The sage was informed as before of the matter, and thought: &ldquo;If they stay here long we shall have no peace; a way must be found to get rid of them. I will devise a stratagem to make them go.&rdquo; So he searched for a man clever in such things, and found one named Anukevaṭṭa. To him he said: &ldquo;Teacher, I have a thing which I want you to carry out.&rdquo; &ldquo;What am I to do, wise sir? Tell me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Stand on the rampart, and when you see our men incautious, immediately let down cakes, fish, meat, and other food to Brahmadatta&rsquo;s men, and say, &lsquo;Here, eat this and this, don&rsquo;t be downhearted; try to stay here a few days longer; before long the people will be like hens in a coop and will open the gate of themselves, and then you will be able to capture Vedeha and that villain of a farmer&rsquo;s son.&rsquo; Our men when they hear this, with harsh upbraiding, will bind you hand and foot in the sight of Brahmadatta&rsquo;s army, and will pretend to beat you with bamboos, and pull you down, and tying your hair in five knots<a id="a13863"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17683"><span class="t9">{1648}</span></a><a id="a13864"></a> will daub you with brickdust, put a garland of kaṇavera<a id="a13865"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17686"><span class="t9">{1649}</span></a> upon you, belabour you soundly until weals rise on your back, take you up on the rampart, tie you up, and let you down by a rope to Brahmadatta&rsquo;s men, crying out, &lsquo;Go, traitor!&rsquo; Then you will be taken before Brahmadatta, and he will ask your offence; you must say to him, &lsquo;Great king, once I was held in great honour, but the farmer&rsquo;s son denounced me to my king for a traitor and robbed me of all. I wished to make the man shorter by a head who has ruined me, and in pity for the despondency of your men <span class="t18">{6.407}</span> I gave them food and drink. For that, with the old grudge in his heart, he brought this destruction upon me. Your own men, O king, know all about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Thus by one means or another you must win the king&rsquo;s confidence, and then say to him: &lsquo;Sire, now you have me, trouble <span class="t18">[6.209] </span>no more. Now Vedeha and the farmer&rsquo;s son are dead men! I know the strong places and the weak places of the ramparts in this city. I know where crocodiles are in the moat and where they are not; before long I will bring the city into your hands.&rsquo; The king will believe you and do you honour, and will place the army in your charge. Then you must bring down the army into the places infested by snakes and crocodiles; the army in fear of the crocodiles will refuse to go down. You must then say to the king, &lsquo;Your army, my lord, has been corrupted by the farmer&rsquo;s son; there is not a man of them, not even teacher Kevaṭṭa and the princes, who has not been bribed. They just walk about guarding you, they are all the creatures of the farmer&rsquo;s son, and I alone am your man. If you do not believe me, order the kings to come before you in full dress; then examine their dresses, their ornaments, their swords, all given them by the farmer&rsquo;s son and inscribed with his name, and assure yourself.&rsquo; He will do so, and make sure, and in fear will dismiss the princes.</p>
<p class="p7">Then he will ask you what is to be done? and you must reply, &lsquo;My lord, the farmer&rsquo;s son is full of resource, and if you stay here a few days he will gain over all the army and capture yourself. Make no delay, but this very night in the middle watch let us take horse and depart, that we die not in the enemy&rsquo;s hands.&rsquo; He will follow your advice; and while he flees away you must return and tell my people.&rdquo; Thereupon Anukevaṭṭa replied, &ldquo;Good, wise sir, I will do your bidding.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then, you must put up with a few blows.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{6.408}</span> &ldquo;Wise sir, do what you will with my body, only spare my life and my limbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Then after showing all respect to Anukevaṭṭa&rsquo;s family, he caused him to be roughly handled in this manner and handed him over to Brahmadatta&rsquo;s men. The king tested him, and trusted him, honoured him and gave him charge of the army; he brought the army down to the places which were infested by snakes and crocodiles; and the men terrified by the crocodiles, and wounded by arrows, spears, and lances cast by soldiers who stood upon the battlements, thus perished, after which none were so brave as to approach. Then Anukevaṭṭa approached the king, and said to him, &ldquo;O great king, there is not a man to fight for you: all have been bribed. If you do not believe me, send for the princes, and see the inscriptions upon their garments and accoutrements.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">This the king did; and seeing inscriptions upon all their garments and accoutrements, he felt sure that indeed these had taken bribes. &ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s to be done now?&rdquo; &ldquo;My lord, there&rsquo;s nothing to be done; if you delay, the farmer&rsquo;s son will capture you. Sire, if the teacher Kevaṭṭa does walk about with a sore on his forehead, yet he also has taken his bribe; he accepted that precious gem, and made you run in rout for three leagues, and then won your confidence again and made you return. He is a traitor! I would not obey him a single night; this very night in the <span class="t18">[6.210] </span>middle watch you should escape. You have not a friend but me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, teacher, get my horse and chariot ready yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Finding that the king was assuredly bent on escape, he encouraged him and bade him fear nothing; then he went out and told the scouts that the king was to escape that night, let them not think of sleep. He next prepared the king&rsquo;s horse, arranging the reins so that the more he pulled the faster the horse would go; and at midnight he said: &ldquo;My lord, your horse is ready; see, it is time.&rdquo; The king mounted the horse and fled. Anukevaṭṭa also got on horseback, as though to go with him, but after going a little way he turned back; and the king&rsquo;s horse, by the arrangement of its reins, <span class="t18">{6.409}</span> pull as the king would, went on.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13866"></a>Then Anukevaṭṭa came amongst the army, and shouted with a loud voice, &ldquo;Cullaṇī Brahmadatta has fled!&rdquo; The scouts and their attendants cried out too. The other princes, hearing the noise, thought in their terror, &ldquo;Sage Mahosadha must have opened the gate and come out; we shall all be dead men!&rdquo; Giving but a look at all the materials of their use and enjoyment,<a id="a13867"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17689"><span class="t9">{1650}</span></a> away they ran. The men shouted the louder, &ldquo;The princes are in rout!&rdquo; Hearing the noise, all the others who stood at the gate and on the towers shouted and clapped their hands. Then the whole city within and without was one great roar, as though the earth cleft asunder, or the great deep were broken up, while the innumerable myriads of that mighty host in mortal terror, without refuge or defence, cried aloud, &ldquo;Brahmadatta is taken by Mahosadha with the hundred and one kings!&rdquo; Away they ran in rout, throwing down even their waistclothes. The camp was empty. Cullaṇī-Brahmadatta entered his own city with the hundred and one chiefs.</p>
<p class="p7">Next morning, the soldiers opened the city gates and went forth, and seeing the great booty, reported it to the Great Being, asking what they were to do. He said: &ldquo;The goods which they have left are ours. Give to our king that which belonged to the princes, and bring to me that which belonged to Kevaṭṭa and the other private persons; all the rest let the citizens take.&rdquo; It took half a month to remove the jewels of price and valuable goods, four months for the rest. The Great Being gave great honour to Anukevaṭṭa. From that day the citizens of Mithilā had plenty of gold.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13868"></a><a id="a13869"></a>Now Brahmadatta and those kings had been a year in the city of Uttarapañcāla; when one day, Kevaṭṭa, looking upon his face in a mirror, saw the scar on his forehead and thought: &ldquo;That is the doing of the farmer&rsquo;s son: he made me a laughingstock before all those kings!&rdquo; Anger arose in him. &ldquo;How can I manage to see his back?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Ah, here is a plan. Our king&rsquo;s daughter, Pañcālacaṇḍī <span class="t18">{6.410}</span> is peerless in beauty, like a divine nymph; I will show her to king Vedeha. He <span class="t18">[6.211] </span>will be caught by desire like a fish that has swallowed the hook: I will land him and Mahosadha with him, and kill them both, and drink the cup of victory!&rdquo; With this resolve, he approached the king. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have an idea.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, teacher, your idea left me once without a rag to cover me. What will you do now? Hold your peace.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, there never was a plan equal to this.&rdquo; &ldquo;Speak on, then.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, we two must be alone.&rdquo; &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo; The brahmin took him into an upper storey, and said: &ldquo;Great king! I will attract king Vedeha by desire, to bring him here, and kill him.&rdquo; &ldquo;A good plan, teacher, but how are we to arouse his desire?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sire, your daughter Pañcālacaṇḍī is peerless in beauty; we will have her charms and accomplishments celebrated in verse by poets, and have those poems sung in Mithilā. When we find that he is saying to himself, &lsquo;If the mighty monarch Vedeha cannot get this pearl of maidens, what is his kingdom to him?&rsquo; and that he is caught in the attraction of the idea, I will go and fix a day; on the day fixed by me he will come, like a fish that has swallowed the hook, and the farmer&rsquo;s son with him; then we will kill them.&rdquo; This pleased the king, and he agreed, &ldquo;A fine plan that, my teacher! So we will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">But a mynah bird, that watched the king&rsquo;s bed, took note of it.</p>
<p class="p7">And so the king sent for clever poets, and paid them richly, and showed them his daughter, bidding them make a poem on her beauty; and they made songs of exceeding great sweetness, and recited them to the king. He rewarded them richly. Musicians learned these songs from the poets, and sang them in public, and thus they were spread abroad. When they had been spread abroad, the king sent for the singers, and said: &ldquo;My children, climb into the trees by night with some birds, sit there and sing, and, in the morning, <span class="t18">{6.411}</span> tie bells about their necks, let them fly, and come down.&rdquo; This he did that the world might say, the very gods sing the beauty of the king of Pañcāla&rsquo;s daughter. Again the king sent for these poets, and said to them, &ldquo;My children, make poems to this effect, that such a princess is not for any king in all Jambudīpa save Vedeha king of Mithilā, praising the king&rsquo;s majesty and the girl&rsquo;s beauty.&rdquo; They did so, and reported it; the king paid them well, and told them to go to Mithilā and sing in the same way.</p>
<p class="p7">They went to Mithilā, singing these songs on the way, and there sang them in public. Crowds of people heard the songs, and amidst loud applause paid them well. At night they would climb into the trees and sing, and, in the morning, tied bells about the birds&rsquo; necks before they came down. People heard the sound of the bells in the air, and all the city rang with the news, that the very gods were singing the beauty of the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king hearing of it sent for the poets, and made an audience in his palace. He was to think that they wanted to give him the peerless daughter of king Cullaṇī. So he paid them well, and they came back and <span class="t18">[6.212] </span>told Brahmadatta. Then Kevaṭṭa said to him, &ldquo;Now, sire, &rsquo;tis time for me to go and settle the day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good, teacher, what must you take with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;A little present.&rdquo; He gave it.</p>
<p class="p7">The other went with it, accompanied by a large following, to Vedeha&rsquo;s kingdom. On his arrival being made known, all the city was in an uproar, &ldquo;King Cullaṇī and Vedeha, they say, will strike a friendship; Cullaṇī will give his daughter to our king, and Kevaṭṭa, they say, is coming to fix a day.&rdquo; King Vedeha also heard this; and the Great Being heard it, and thought: &ldquo;I like not his coming; I must find out about it exactly.&rdquo; So he sent word to spies that lived with Cullaṇī. They replied, &ldquo;We do not quite understand this business. The king and Kevaṭṭa were sitting and talking in the royal bedchamber; but the mynah which watches the bedchamber will know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">On hearing this, the Great Being thought: <span class="t18">{6.412}</span> &ldquo;That our enemies may not have an advantage, I will parcel out the whole city and decorate it, and not allow Kevaṭṭa to see it.&rdquo; So from the city gate to the palace, and from the palace to his own house, on both sides of the road he erected lattice-work, and covered all over with mats, covered all with pictures, scattered flowers upon the ground, set jars full of water in place, hung flags and banners. Kevaṭṭa as he entered the city could not see its arrangements; he thought the king had decorated it for his sake, and did not understand that it had been done that he might not see. When he came before the king, he offered his gift, and with a courteous greeting sat down on one side. Then after an honourable reception, he recited two verses, to announce the reason of his arrival:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">93. &ldquo;A king who wishes for your friendship sends you these precious things: now let worthy sweet-spoken ambassadors come from that place.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">94. Let them utter gentle words which shall give pleasure, and let the people of Pañcāla and Videha be as one.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;he would have sent another in place of me, but me he sent, feeling sure that no other could tell the tale so pleasantly as I should do. &lsquo;Go, teacher,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;win over the king to look favourably upon it, and bring him back with you.&rsquo; Now, sire, go, and you shall receive an excellent and beautiful princess, and there shall be friendship established between our king and you.&rdquo; The king was pleased at this proposal; he was attracted by the idea that he should receive a princess of peerless beauty, and replied, &ldquo;Teacher, there was a quarrel between you and the wise Mahosadha at the Battle of the Dhamma. Now go and see my son; <span class="t18">{6.413}</span> you two wise men must make up your differences; and after a talk together, come back.&rdquo; Kevaṭṭa promised to go and see the sage, and he went.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the Great Being that day, determined to avoid talking with this bad man, in the morning drank a little ghee; they smeared the floor <span class="t18">[6.213] </span>with wet cow-dung, and smeared the pillars with oil; all chairs and seats they removed except one narrow couch on which he lay. To his servants he gave orders as follows, &ldquo;When the brahmin begins to talk, say, &lsquo;Brahmin, do not talk with the sage; he has taken a dose of ghee today&rsquo;. And when I make as though to talk with him, stop me, saying, &lsquo;My lord, you have taken a dose of ghee &ndash; do not talk.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a13870"></a>After these instructions the Great Being covered himself with a red robe, and lay down on his couch, after posting men at the seven gate-towers.<a id="a13871"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17691"><span class="t9">{1651}</span></a> Kevaṭṭa, reaching the first gate, asked where the wise man was? Then the servants answered, &ldquo;Brahmin, do not make much noise; if you wish to go in, go silently. Today the sage has taken ghee, and he cannot stand a noise.&rdquo; At the other gates they told him the same thing. When he came to the seventh gate, he entered the presence of the sage, and the sage made as though to speak: but they said: &ldquo;My lord, do not talk; you have taken a strong dose of ghee &ndash; why should you talk with this wretched brahmin?&rdquo; So they stayed him. The other came in, but could not find where to sit, nor a place to stand by the bed. He passed over the wet cow-dung and stood. Then one looked at him and rubbed his eyes, one lifted his eyebrow, one scratched his elbow. When he saw this, he was annoyed, and said: &ldquo;Wise sir, I am going.&rdquo; Another said: &ldquo;Ha, wretched brahmin, don&rsquo;t make a noise! If you do, I&rsquo;ll break your bones for you!&rdquo; Terrified he looked back, when another struck him on the back with a bamboo stick, another caught him by the throat and pushed him, another slapped him on the back, until he departed in fear, like a fawn from the panther&rsquo;s mouth, and returned to the palace.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the king thought: <span class="t18">{6.414}</span> &ldquo;Today my son will be pleased to hear the news. What a talking there will be between the two wise men about the Dhamma! Today they will be reconciled together, and I shall be the gainer.&rdquo; So when he saw Kevaṭṭa, he recited a verse, asking about their conversation together:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">95. &ldquo;How did your meeting with Mahosadha come off, Kevaṭṭa? Pray tell me that. Was Mahosadha reconciled, was he pleased?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">To this Kevaṭṭa replied, &ldquo;Sire, you think that is a wise man, but there is not another man less good,&rdquo; and he recited a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13872"></a><span class="t12">96. &ldquo;He is a man ignoble of nature, lord of men! Disagreeable, obstinate, wicked in disposition, like one dumb or deaf: he said not a word.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">This displeased the king, but he found no fault. He provided Kevaṭṭa and his attendants with all that they needed and a house to live in, and bade him go and rest. After he had sent him away the king thought <span class="t18">[6.214] </span>to himself, &ldquo;My son is wise, and knows well how to be courteous; yet he would not speak courteously to this man and did not want to see him. Surely he must have seen cause for some apprehension in the future!&rdquo; Then he composed a verse of his own:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">97. &ldquo;Verily this resolution is very hard to understand; a clear issue has been foreseen by this strong man. Therefore my body is shaken: who shall lose his own and fall into the hands of his foe?</span><span class="t18"> {6.415}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13873"></a>No doubt my son saw some mischief in the brahmin&rsquo;s visit. He will have come here for no friendly purpose. He must have wished to attract me by desire, and make me go to his city, and there capture me. The sage must have foreseen some danger to come.&rdquo; As he was turning over these thoughts in his mind, with alarm, the four wise men came in. The king said to Senaka, &ldquo;Well, Senaka, do you think I ought to go to the city of Uttarapañcāla and marry king Cullaṇī&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;O sire, what is this you say! When luck comes your way, who would drive it off with blows? If you go there and marry her, you will have no equal save Cullaṇī Brahmadatta in all Jambudīpa, because you will have married the daughter of the chief king. The king knows that the other princes are his men, and Vedeha alone is his peer, and so desires to give you his peerless daughter. Do as he says and we also shall receive dresses and ornaments.&rdquo; When the king asked the others, they all said the same. And as they were thus conversing, brahmin Kevaṭṭa came from his lodging to take his leave of the king, and go; and he said: &ldquo;Sire, I cannot linger here, I would go, prince of men!&rdquo; The king showed him respect, and let him go.</p>
<p class="p7">When the Great Being heard of his departure, he bathed and dressed and went to wait on the king, and saluting him sat on one side. Thought the king, &ldquo;Wise Mahosadha my son is great and full of resource, he knows past, present and future; he will know whether I ought to go or not,&rdquo; yet befooled by passion he did not keep to his first resolve, but asked his question in a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">98. &ldquo;All six have one opinion, and they are sages supreme in wisdom. To go or not to go, to abide here &ndash; Mahosadha, tell me your opinion also.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.416}</span></p>
<p class="p6">At this the sage thought: &ldquo;This king is exceedingly greedy in desire: blind and foolish he listens to the words of these four. I will tell him the mischief of going and dissuade him.&rdquo; So he repeated four verses:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13874"></a><span class="t12">99. &ldquo;Do you know, great king: mighty and strong is king Cullaṇī Brahmadatta, and he wants you to kill, as a hunter catches the deer by decoy.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">100-101. As a fish greedy for food does not recognize the hook hidden in the bait, or a mortal his death, so you O king, greedy in desire, do not recognize Cullaṇī&rsquo;s daughter, you, mortal, your own death.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">102. Go to Pañcāla, and in a little time you will destroy yourself, as a deer caught on the road comes into great danger.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [6.215] {6.417}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13875"></a>At this heavy rebuke,<a id="a13876"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17693"><span class="t9">{1652}</span></a> the king was angry. &ldquo;The man thinks I am his slave,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;he forgets I am a king. He knows that the chief king has sent to offer me his daughter, and says not a word of good wishes, but foretells that I shall be caught and killed like a silly deer or a fish that swallows the hook or a deer caught on the road!&rdquo; and immediately he recited a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">103. &ldquo;I was foolish, I was deaf and dumb, to consult you on high matters. How can you understand things like other men, when you grew up hanging on to the plow-tail?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">With these opprobrious words, he said: &ldquo;This clodhopper is hindering my good luck! Away with him!&rdquo; and to get rid of him he uttered this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">104. &ldquo;Take this fellow by the neck and rid my kingdom of him, who speaks to hinder my getting a jewel.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">But he, seeing the king&rsquo;s anger, thought: &ldquo;If any one at the bidding of this king seize me by hand or by neck, or touch me, I shall be disgraced to my dying day; therefore I will go of myself.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{6.418}</span> So he saluted the king and went to his house. Now the king had merely spoken in anger: but out of respect for the Bodhisatta he did not command any one to carry out his words. Then the Great Being thought: &ldquo;This king is a fool, he knows not his own profit or unprofit. He is in love; and determined to get that princess, he does not perceive the danger to come; he will go to his ruin. I ought not to let his words lie in my mind. He is my great benefactor, and has done me much honour. I must have confidence in him. But first I will send the parrot and find out the facts, then I will go myself.&rdquo; So he sent the parrot.</p>
<p class="p7">To explain this the Teacher said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">105. &ldquo;Then he went out of Vedeha&rsquo;s presence, and spake to his messenger, Māṭhara, the clever parrot:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">106-107. Come, my green parrot, do a service for me. The king of Pañcāla has a mynah that watches his bed: ask him in full, for he knows all, knows all the secrets of the king and Kosiya.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">108. Māṭhara the clever parrot listened, and went &ndash; the green parrot &ndash; to the mynah bird.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">109. Then this clever parrot Māṭhara spake to the sweet-voiced mynah in her fine cage:</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13877"></a><span class="t12">110. &lsquo;Is all well with you in your fine cage? Is all happy, O Vessā?</span><a id="a13878"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17696"><span class="t19">{1653}</span></a><span class="t12"> Do they give you parched honey-corn in your fine cage?&rsquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">111. &lsquo;All is well with me, sir, indeed, all is happy, they do give me parched honey-corn, O clever parrot.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">112. Why have you come, sir, and why were you sent? I never saw you or heard of you before.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.419}</span></p>
<p class="p6">On hearing this, he thought: &ldquo;If I say, I am come from Mithilā, for her life she will never trust me. On my way I noticed the town Ariṭṭhapura in this kingdom of Sivi; so I will make up a false tale, how the king of Sivi has sent me here,&rdquo; and he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">113. &ldquo;I was king Sivi&rsquo;s chamberlain in his palace, and from thence that righteous king set the prisoners free from bondage.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [6.216] {6.420}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the mynah gave him the honey-corn and honey-water which stood ready for her in a golden dish, and said: &ldquo;Sir, you have come a long way: what has brought you?&rdquo; He made up a tale, desirous to learn the secret, and said,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">114. &ldquo;I once had to wife a sweet-voiced mynah, and a hawk killed her before my eyes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then she asked, &ldquo;But how did the hawk kill your wife?&rdquo; He told her this story. &ldquo;Listen, madam. One day our king invited me to join him at a water-party. My wife and I went with him, and amused ourselves. In the evening we returned with him to the palace. To dry our feathers, my wife and I flew out of a window and sat on the top of a pinnacle. At that moment a hawk swooped down to catch us as we were leaving the pinnacle. In fear of my life I flew swiftly off; but she was heavy then, and could not fly fast; hence before my eyes he killed her and carried her off. The king saw me weeping for her loss, and asked me the reason. On hearing what had occurred, he said: &ldquo;Enough, friend, do not weep, but look for another wife.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;What need I, my lord, to wed another, wicked and vicious? Better to live alone.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Friend, I know a bird virtuous like your wife; king Cullaṇī&rsquo;s chamberlain is a mynah like her. Go and ask her will, and let her reply, and if she likes you come and tell me; then I or my queen will go with great pomp and bring her back.&rdquo; With these words he sent me, and that is why I am come.&rdquo; And he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">115. &ldquo;Full of love for her I am come to you: if you give me leave we might dwell together.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.421}</span></p>
<p class="p6">These words pleased her exceedingly; but without showing her feelings she said, as though unwilling:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">116. &ldquo;Parrot should love parrot, and mynah love mynah: how can there be union between parrot and mynah?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The other hearing this thought: &ldquo;She does not reject me; she is only making much of herself. Indeed she loves me doubtless. I will find some parables to make her trust me.&rdquo; So he said:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">117. &ldquo;Whomsoever the lover loves, be it a low Caṇḍālī, all are alike: in love there is no unlikeness.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">This said, he went on, to show the measure of the differences in the birth of men,</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">118. &ldquo;The mother of the king of Sivi is named Jambāvatī, and she was the beloved queen consort of Vāsudeva the Kaṇha.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13879"></a>Now the king of Sivi&rsquo;s mother, Jambāvatī, was an outcaste, and she was the beloved queen consort of Vāsudeva, one of the Kaṇhāgaṇa clan, the eldest of ten brothers. The story goes, that he one day went out from Dvāravatī into the park; and on his way he espied a very beautiful <span class="t18">[6.217] </span>girl, standing by the way, as she journeyed on some business from her outcaste village to town. He fell in love, and asked her birth; and on hearing that she was a Caṇḍālī, he was distressed. Finding that she was unmarried, he turned back at once, and took her home, surrounded her with precious things, and made her his chief queen. She brought forth a son Sivi, who ruled in Dvāravatī at his father&rsquo;s death.<span class="t18"> {6.422}</span></p>
<p class="p7">After giving this example, he went on, &ldquo;Thus even a prince such as he mated with an outcaste; and what of us, who are but of the animal kingdom? If we like to mate together, there is no more to be said.&rdquo; And he gave another example as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">119. &ldquo;Rathavatī, a Kimpurisī, also loved Vaccha, and the man loved the animal. In love there is no unlikeness.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13880"></a>Vaccha was an ascetic of that name, and the way she loved him was this. In times gone by, a brahmin, who had seen the evil of the passions, left great wealth to follow the ascetic life, and lived in the Himālayas in a hut of leaves which he made him. Not far from this hut in a cave lived a number of Kinnaras, and in the same place lived a spider. This spider used to spin his web, and crack the heads of these creatures, and drink their blood. Now the Kinnaras were weak and timid, the spider was mighty and very poisonous: they could do nothing against him, so they came to the ascetic, and saluted him, and told him how a spider was destroying them and they could see no help; wherefore they begged him to kill the spider and save them. But the ascetic drove them away, crying, &ldquo;Men like me take no life!&rdquo; A female of these creatures, named Rathavatī, was unmarried; and they brought her in all her finery to the ascetic, and said: &ldquo;Let her be your handmaiden, and do you slay our enemy.&rdquo; When the ascetic saw her he fell in love, and kept her with him, and lay in wait for the spider at the cave&rsquo;s mouth, and as he came out for food killed him with a club. So he lived with the Kinnarī and begat sons and daughters on her, and then died. Thus she loved him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The parrot, having described this example, said: &ldquo;Vaccha the ascetic, although a man, lived with a Kinnarī, who belonged to the animal world; why should not we do the same, who both are birds?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">When she heard him she said: &ldquo;My lord, the heart is not always the same: I fear separation from my beloved.&rdquo; But he, being wise and versed in the wiles of women, further tested her with this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">120. &ldquo;Verily I shall go away, O sweet-voiced mynah. This is a refusal; no doubt you despise me.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.423}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this she felt as though her heart would break; but before him she made as though she was burning with newly awakened love, and recited a verse and a half:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">121. &ldquo;No luck for the hasty, O wise parrot Māṭhara. Stay here until you shall see the king, and hear the sound of tabours and see the splendour of our king.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [6.218]</span></p>
<p class="p6">So when evening came they took their pleasure together; and they lived in friendship and pleasure and delight. Then the parrot thought, &lsquo;Now she will not hide the secret from me; now I must ask it of her and go.&rsquo; &ldquo;Mynah,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What is it, my lord?&rdquo; &ldquo;I want to ask you something; shall I say it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Say on, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never mind, today is a festival; another day I will see about it.&rdquo; &ldquo;If it be suitable to a festival, say it, if not, my lord, say nothing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed, this is a thing fit for a festival day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then speak.&rdquo; &ldquo;If you will listen, I will speak.&rdquo; Then he asked the secret in a verse and a half:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">122. &ldquo;This sound so loud heard over the countryside &ndash; the daughter of the king of Pañcāla, bright as a star &ndash; he will give her to the Videhas, and this will be their wedding!&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {6.424}</span></p>
<p class="p6">When she heard this she said: &ldquo;My lord! On a day of festival you have said a thing most unlucky!&rdquo; &ldquo;I say it is lucky, you say it is unlucky: what can this mean?&rdquo; &ldquo;I cannot tell you, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Madam, from the time when you refuse to tell me a secret which you know, our happy union ends.&rdquo; Importuned by him she replied, &ldquo;Then, my lord, listen:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">123. Let not even your enemies have such a wedding, Māṭhara, as there shall be betwixt the kings of Pañcāla and Videha.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then he asked, &ldquo;Why do you ask such a thing, madam?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;Listen now, and I will tell you the mischief of it,&rdquo; and she repeated another verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">124. &ldquo;The mighty king of Pañcāla will attract Videha, and then he will kill him; his friend he will not be.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So she told the whole secret to the wise parrot; and the wise parrot, hearing it, extolled Kevaṭṭa, &ldquo;This teacher has skill in means; &rsquo;tis a wonderful plan to kill the king. But what is so unlucky a thing to us? Silence is best.&rdquo; Thus he attained the fruit of his journey. And after passing the night with her, he said: &ldquo;Lady, I would go to the Sivi country, and tell the king how I have got a loving wife,&rdquo; and he took leave in the following words:<span class="t18"> {6.425}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">125. &ldquo;Now give me leave for just seven nights, that I may tell the mighty king of Sivi, how I have found a dwelling-place with a mynah.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The mynah hereat, although unwilling to part with him, yet unable to refuse, recited the next verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a13881"></a><span class="t12">126. &ldquo;Now I give you leave for seven nights; if after seven nights you do not return to me, I see myself gone down into the grave; I shall be dead when you return.&rdquo;</span><a id="a13882"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17698"><span class="t19">{1654}</span></a><span class="t18"> [6.219]</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a13883"></a>The other said: &ldquo;Lady, what is this you say! If I see you not after seven days, how can I live?&rdquo; So he spake with his lips, but thought in his heart, &ldquo;Live or die,<a id="a13884"></a><a href="notes3.html#a17700"><span class="t9">{1655}</span></a> what care I for you?&rdquo; He rose up, and after flying for a short distance towards the Sivi country, he turned off and went to Mithilā. Then descending upon the wise man&rsquo;s shoulder, when the Great Being had taken him to the upper storey, and asked his news, he told him all. The other did him all honour as before.</p>
<p class="p7">This the Teacher explained as follows:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">127. &ldquo;And then Māṭhara, the wise parrot, said to Mahosadha: &lsquo;This is the story of the mynah.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
