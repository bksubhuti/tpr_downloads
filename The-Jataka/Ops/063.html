<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present the Buddha admonishes the king of Kosala that he should rule righteously, and all will be well with the kingdom. He then tells a story of how a wise minister once used skilful parables to guide a king who had gone astray.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;The peak&rsquo;s a cubit.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.197] {3.317}</span><a id="a9447"></a><span class="t30"> &ndash; The Teacher told this while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning the admonition of a king. The occasion will appear in the Tesakuṇajātaka [Ja 521].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9448"></a><span class="t34">This story the Teacher, while dwelling at Jetavana, told by way of admonition to the king of Kosala. Now this king came to hear the preaching of the Dhamma and the Teacher addressed him in the following terms, &ldquo;A king, sire, ought to rule his kingdom righteously, for whenever kings are unrighteous, then also are his officers unrighteous.&rdquo; And admonishing him in the right way as related in the Catukkanipāta [Ja 334] he pointed out the suffering and the blessing involved in following or abstaining from evil courses, and expounded in detail the misery resulting from sensual pleasures, comparing them to dreams and the like, saying: &ldquo;In the case of these men,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">No bribe can move relentless death, no kindness mollify,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t37">No one in fight can vanquish death. For all are doomed to die.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t34">And when they depart to another world, except their own virtuous action they have no other sure refuge, so that they must inevitably forsake low associations, and for their reputation&rsquo;s sake they must not be careless, but be earnest and exercise rule in righteousness, even as kings of old, before Buddha arose, abiding in the admonition of the wise, ruled righteously and departing attained to the heavenly city,&rdquo; and at the request of the king he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was his councillor in things temporal and spiritual. The king was set on the way of the evil courses, ruled his kingdom unrighteously and collected wealth by oppressing the people. The Bodhisatta wishing to admonish him went about looking for a parable. Now the king&rsquo;s bedchamber was unfinished and the roof was not complete upon it; the rafters supported a peak but were only just set in position. The king had gone and taken his pleasure in the park; when he came to his house he looked up and saw the round peak, fearing it would fall upon him he went and stood outside, then looking up again he thought: &ldquo;How is that peak resting so? And how are the rafters?&rdquo; and asking the Bodhisatta he spoke the first verse; <span class="t18">{3.318}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a9449"></a><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;The peak&rsquo;s a cubit and a half in height,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Eight spans will compass it in circuit round,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Of siṁsapa and sāra built aright;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why does it stand so sound?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing him the Bodhisatta thought: &ldquo;I have now got a parable to admonish the king,&rdquo; and spoke these verses;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;The thirty rafters bent, of sāra wood,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Set equally, encompass it around,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They press it tightly, for their hold is good;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis set aright and sound. </span><span class="t18">[3.198]</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. So is the wise man, girt by faithful friends,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By steadfast counsellors and pure;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Never from height of fortune he descends,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As rafters hold the peak secure.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.319}</span></p>
<p class="p6">While the Bodhisatta was speaking, the king considered his own conduct, &ldquo;If there is no peak, the rafters do not stand fast; the peak does not stand if not held by the rafters; if the rafters break, the peak falls; and even so a bad king, not holding together his friends and ministers, his armies, his brahmins and householders, if these break up, is not held by them but falls from his power; a king must be righteous.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">At that instant they brought him a citron as a present. The king said to the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Friend, eat this citron.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta took it and said: &ldquo;O king, people who know not how to eat this make it bitter or acid; but wise men who know take away the bitter, and without removing the acid or spoiling the citron-flavour they eat it,&rdquo; and by this parable he showed the king the means of collecting wealth, and spoke two verses;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;The rough-skinned citron bitter is to eat,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If it remain untouched by carver&rsquo;s steel;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Take but the pulp, O king, and it is sweet;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">You spoil the sweetness if you add the peel.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. Even so the wise man without violence,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Gathers king&rsquo;s dues in village and in town,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Increases wealth, and yet gives no offence;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He walks the way of right and of renown.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.320}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king taking counsel with the Bodhisatta went to a lotus-tank, and seeing a lotus in flower, with a hue like the new-risen sun, not defiled by the water, he said: &ldquo;Friend, that lotus grown in the water stands undefiled by the water.&rdquo; Then the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;O king, so should a king be,&rdquo; and spoke these verses in admonition;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Like the lotus in the pool,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">White roots, waters pure, sustain it;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">In the sun&rsquo;s face flowering full,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dust nor mud nor wet can stain it.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. So the man whom virtues rule,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Meek and pure and good we style him;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like the lotus in the pool</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Stain of wrong cannot defile him.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.321}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king hearing the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s admonition afterwards ruled his kingdom righteously, and doing good actions, generosity and the rest, became destined for heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the king was Ānanda, the wise minister myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present a monk ordained under the Buddha is easily persuaded to partake of Devadatta&rsquo;s good food, rather than go on almsround. He is brought to the Buddha who tells a story of a lion who befriended a jackal and through following his bad advice was killed by the king&rsquo;s men.</span></p>

The occasion was given at length in the Mahilāmukhatajātaka [Ja 26].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9458"></a><span class="t34">This story was told by the Teacher while at the Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta, who, having secured the adherence of prince Ajātasattu, had attained both gain and honour. Prince Ajātasattu had a monastery built for Devadatta at Gayāsīsa, and every day brought to him five hundred pots of perfumed three-year-old rice flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. All this gain and honour brought Devadatta a great following, with whom Devadatta lived on, without ever stirring out of his monastery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At that time there were living in Rājagaha two friends, of whom one had taken the vows under the Teacher, while the other had taken them under Devadatta. And these continued to see one another, either casually or by visiting the monasteries. Now one day the disciple of Devadatta said to the other, &ldquo;Sir, why do you daily go round for alms with the sweat streaming off you? Devadatta sits quietly at Gayāsīsa and feeds on the best of fare, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings. There&rsquo;s no way like his. Why create misery for yourself? Why should it not be a good thing for you to come the first thing in the morning to the monastery at Gayāsīsa and there drink our rice-gruel with a relish after it, try our eighteen kinds of solid victuals, and enjoy our excellent soft food, flavoured with all the choicest flavourings?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Being pressed time after time to accept the invitation, the other began to want to go, and thenceforth used to go to Gayāsīsa and there eat and eat, not forgetting however to return to the Bamboo Grove at the proper hour. Nevertheless he could not keep it secret always; and in a little while it came out that he used to go to Gayāsīsa and there regale himself with the food provided for Devadatta. Accordingly, his friends asked him, saying: &ldquo;Is it true, as they say, that you regale yourself on the food provided for Devadatta?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;So-and-so said it.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true, sirs, that I go to Gayāsīsa and eat there. But it is not Devadatta who gives me food; others do that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, Devadatta is the foe of the Buddhas; in his wickedness, he has secured the adherence of Ajātasattu and by unrighteousness got gain and honour for himself. Yet you who have taken the vows according to this dispensation which leads to safety, eat the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness. Come; let us bring you before the Teacher.&rdquo; And, taking with them the monk, they went to the Dhamma Hall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When the Teacher became aware of their presence, he said: &ldquo;Monks, are you bringing this monk here against his will?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir; this monk, after taking the vows under you, eats the food which Devadatta gets by unrighteousness.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, he is not keeping bad company for the first time,&rdquo; and told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a lion and living with a lioness had two children, a son and a daughter. The son&rsquo;s name was Manoja. When he grew up he took a young lioness to wife; and so they became five. Manoja killed wild buffaloes and other animals, and so got flesh to feed his parents, sister and wife. <span class="t18">{3.322}</span> One day in his hunting ground he saw a jackal called Giriya, unable to run away and lying on his belly. &ldquo;How now, friend?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish to wait on you, my lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, do so.&rdquo; So he took the jackal to his den.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9459"></a>The Bodhisatta seeing him said: &ldquo;Dear Manoja, jackals are wicked and sinners, and give wrong advice; don&rsquo;t bring this one near you,&rdquo; but could not hinder him. Then one day the jackal wished to eat horseflesh, and said to Manoja, &ldquo;Sir, except horseflesh there is nothing we have not eaten; let us take a horse.&rdquo; &ldquo;But where are there horses, friend?&rdquo; &ldquo;At Benares by the river bank.&rdquo; He took this advice and went with him there when the horses bathe in the river; he took one horse, and throwing it on his back he came with speed to the mouth of his den. His father eating the horseflesh said: &ldquo;Dear, horses are kings&rsquo; property, kings have many stratagems, they have skilful archers to shoot; lions who eat horseflesh don&rsquo;t live long, henceforward don&rsquo;t take horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The lion not following his father&rsquo;s advice went on taking them. The king, hearing that a lion was taking the horses, had a bathing-tank for horses made inside the town; but the lion still came and took them. The king had a stable made, and had fodder and water given them inside it. The lion came over the wall and took the horses even from the stable. The king had an archer called who shot like lightning, and asked if he could shoot a lion. He said he could, and making a tower near the wall where the lion came he waited there. The lion came and, posting the jackal in a cemetery outside, sprang into the town to take the horses. The <span class="t18">[3.200] </span>archer thinking: &ldquo;His speed is very great when he comes,&rdquo; did not shoot him, but when he was going away after taking a horse, hampered by the heavy weight, he hit him with a sharp arrow in the hind quarters. The arrow came out at his front quarters and flew in the air. <span class="t18">{3.323}</span> The lion yelled, &ldquo;I am shot.&rdquo; The archer after shooting him twanged his bow like thunder. The jackal hearing the noise of lion and bow said to himself, &ldquo;My comrade is shot and must be killed, there is no friendship with the dead, I will now go to my old home in the wood,&rdquo; and so he spoke two verses;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;The bow is bent, the bowstring sounds amain;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Manoja, king of beasts, my friend, is slain.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. Alas, I seek the woods as best I may;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Such friendship&rsquo;s naught; others must be my stay.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The lion with a rush came and threw the horse at the den&rsquo;s mouth, falling dead himself. His kinsfolk came out and saw him blood-stained, blood flowing from his wounds, dead from following the wicked; and his father, mother, sister and wife seeing him spoke four verses in order;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;His fortune is not prosperous whom wicked folk entice;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Look at Manoja lying there, through Giriya&rsquo;s advice.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. No joy have mothers in a son whose comrades are not good;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Look at Manoja lying there all covered with his blood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. And even so fares still the man, in low estate he lies,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who follows not the counsel of the true friend and the wise.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. This, or worse than this, his fate</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who is high, but trusts the low; </span><span class="t18">{3.324}</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">See, &rsquo;tis thus from kingly state</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He has fallen to the bow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Lastly, the verse spoken after Fully Awakening;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Who follows outcastes is himself out cast,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who courts his equals ne&rsquo;er will be betrayed,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Who bows before the noblest rises fast;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Look therefore to your betters for thine aid.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, After the Truths the monk who kept bad company was established in the fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time the jackal was Devadatta, Manoja was the keeper of bad company, his sister was Uppalavaṇnā, his wife the nun Khemā, his mother the mother of Rāhula, his father myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

The occasion will appear in the Sāmajātaka [Ja 540].</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9470"></a><a id="a9471"></a><span class="t34">They say that there was a wealthy merchant at Sāvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, he exclaimed that he would go too.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the Tathāgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parents&rsquo; consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then he thought to himself, &ldquo;I live here distracted &ndash; it is not suitable for me,&rdquo; and he became anxious to reach the goal of spiritual insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the son&rsquo;s place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, &ldquo;Tell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchant&rsquo;s family in Sāvatthi.&rdquo; &ldquo;O friend, don&rsquo;t ask for news of that family.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;They say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When he heard the other&rsquo;s words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, &ldquo;O sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;they are my own father and mother, I am their son.&rdquo; &ldquo;O friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you &ndash; do you go and take care of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;For twelve years,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;I have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit; I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for heaven.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from Sāvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to Sāvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: &ldquo;Shall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?&rdquo; Then he said to himself, &ldquo;In old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.&rdquo; So he left the road to Sāvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the Mātiposakasutta [SN 7.19]. As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: &ldquo;If I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, &lsquo;A son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,&rsquo; I went away before without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.&rdquo; So he took his ticket and his ticket-food and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to Sāvatthi and he thought to himself, &ldquo;Shall I first get the gruel or see my parents?&rdquo; He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their round for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, &ldquo;We have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.&rdquo; When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At last the father said to the mother, &ldquo;Go to him; can this be your son?&rdquo; She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: &ldquo;Do not grieve, I will support you,&rdquo; so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9472"></a><a id="a9473"></a><span class="t34">From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, &ldquo;Your complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale &ndash; has some illness come upon you?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;No illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,&rdquo; and he told them the history. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;the Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.&rdquo; When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;So and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.&rdquo; The Teacher sent for the young man of family and said to him, &ldquo;Is it true that you, an ascetic, take the offerings of the faithful and support laymen with them?&rdquo; He confessed that it was true. Then the Teacher, wishing to praise what he had done and to declare an old action of his own, said: &ldquo;When you support laymen whom do you support?&rdquo; &ldquo;My parents,&rdquo; he answered. Then the Teacher, wishing to encourage him still more said: &ldquo;Well done, well done,&rdquo; three times, &ldquo;You are in a path which I have traversed before you; I in old time, while going the round for alms, supported my parents.&rdquo; The ascetic was encouraged thereby. At the request of the monks the Teacher, to make known his former actions, told them a story of the past. </span><span class="t35">{3.325}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in the family of a poor householder; they called his name Sutana. When he grew up he earned wages and supported his parents; when his father died, he supported his mother. The king of that day was fond of hunting. One day he went with a great retinue to a forest a league or two in extent, and made proclamation to all, &ldquo;If a deer escape by any man&rsquo;s post, the man is fined the value of the deer.&rdquo; The ministers having made a concealed hut by the regular road gave it to the king. The deer were roused by the crying of men who had surrounded their lairs, and one antelope came to the king&rsquo;s post. The king thought: &ldquo;I will hit him,&rdquo; and sent an arrow. The animal, who knew a trick, saw that the arrow was coming to his broadside, and wheeling round fell as if wounded by the arrow. The king thought: &ldquo;I have hit him,&rdquo; and rushed to seize him. The deer rose and fled like the wind. The ministers and the rest mocked the king. He pursued the deer and when it was tired he cut it in two with his sword; hanging the pieces on one stick he came as if carrying a pole and saying: &ldquo;I will rest a little,&rdquo; he drew near to a banyan tree by the road and lying down fell asleep.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9474"></a>A Yakkha called Makhādeva was reborn in that banyan, and got from Vessavaṇa<a id="a9475"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15630"><span class="t9">{663}</span></a> all living things who came to it as his food. When the king rose he said: &ldquo;Stay, you are my food,&rdquo; and took him by the hand. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;I am a Yakkha born here, I get all men who come to this place as my food.&rdquo; The king, taking good heart, asked, &ldquo;Will you eat today only or continually?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will eat continually what I get.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then eat this deer today and let me go; from tomorrow I will send you a man with a plate of rice every day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be careful then; on the day when no one is sent <span class="t18">{3.326}</span> I will eat you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am king of Benares; there is nothing I cannot do.&rdquo; The Yakkha took his promise and let him go. When the king came to the town, he told the case to a minister in attendance and asked what was to be done.<span class="t18"> [3.202]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Was a limit of time fixed, O king?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;That was wrong when you were about it; but never mind, there are many men in the jail.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then do you manage this affair, and give me life.&rdquo; The minister agreed, and taking a man from the jail every day sent him to the Yakkha with a plate of rice without telling him anything. The Yakkha ate both rice and man. After a time the jails became empty. The king finding no one to carry the rice shook with fear of death. The minister comforting him said: &ldquo;O king, desire of wealth is stronger than desire of life; let us put a packet of a thousand pieces on an elephant&rsquo;s back and make proclamation by drum, &ldquo;Who will take rice and go to the Yakkha and get this wealth?&rdquo; and he did so.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta thought: &ldquo;I get pence and halfpence for my wages and can hardly support my mother; I will get this wealth and give it her, and then go to the Yakkha; if I can get the better of him, well, and if I cannot she will live comfortably,&rdquo; so he told his mother, but she said: &ldquo;I have enough, dear, I don&rsquo;t need wealth,&rdquo; and so forbade him twice; but the third time without asking her, he said: &ldquo;Sirs, bring the thousand pieces, I will take the rice.&rdquo; So he gave his mother the thousand pieces and said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret, dear; I will overcome the Yakkha and give happiness to the people; I will come making your tearful face to laugh,&rdquo; and so saluting her he went to the king with the king&rsquo;s men, and saluting him stood there.</p>
<p class="p7">The king said: &ldquo;My good man, will you take the rice?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, O king.&rdquo; &ldquo;What should you take with you?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.327}</span><a id="a9476"></a> &ldquo;Your golden slippers, O king.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;O king, that Yakkha gets to eat all people standing on the ground at the foot of the tree; I will stand on slippers, not on his ground.&rdquo; &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; &ldquo;Your umbrella, O king.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; &ldquo;O king, the Yakkha gets to eat all people standing in the shade of his own tree; I will stand in the shade of the umbrella, not of his tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; &ldquo;Your sword, O king.&rdquo; &ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo; &ldquo;O king, even Amanussas fear those with weapons in their hands.&rdquo; &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; &ldquo;Your golden bowl, O king, filled with your own rice.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, good man?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is not meet for a wise man like me to take coarse food in an earthen dish.&rdquo; The king consented and sent officers to give him all he asked. The Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;Fear not, O great king, I will come back today having overcome the Yakkha and caused you happiness,&rdquo; and so taking the things needful and going to the place, he set men not far from the tree, put on the golden slippers, girt the sword, put the white umbrella over his head, and taking rice in a gold dish went to the Yakkha. The Yakkha watching the road saw him and thought: &ldquo;This man comes not as they came on the other days, what is the reason?&rdquo; The Bodhisatta drawing near the tree pushed the plate of rice in the shadow with the sword-point, and standing near the shadow spoke the first verse;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;The king has sent you rice prepared and seasoned well with meat;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If Makhādeva is at home, let him come forth and eat!&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.203] {3.328}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing him the Yakkha thought: &ldquo;I will deceive him, and eat him when he comes into the shadow,&rdquo; and so he spoke the second verse;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Come inside, young man, with your seasoned food,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Both it and you, young man, to eat are good.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the Bodhisatta spoke two verses;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Yakkha, you&rsquo;ll lose a great thing for a small,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Men fearing death will bring no food at all.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. You&rsquo;ll have good supply of cheer,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pure and sweet and flavoured to your mind;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But a man to bring it here,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If you eat me, will be hard to find.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.329}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Yakkha thought: &ldquo;The young man speaks sense,&rdquo; and being well disposed spoke two verses;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Young Sutana, my interests are clearly as you show;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Visit your mother then in peace, you have my leave to go.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. Take sword, and parasol, and dish, young man, and go your ways,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Visit your mother happily and bring her happy days.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing the Yakkha&rsquo;s words the Bodhisatta was pleased, thinking: &ldquo;My task is accomplished, the Yakkha overcome, much wealth won and the king&rsquo;s word made good,&rdquo; and so returning thanks to the Yakkha he spoke a final verse;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;With all your kith and kin, Yakkha, right happy may you be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The king&rsquo;s command has been performed, and wealth has come to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So he admonished the Yakkha, saying: &ldquo;Friend, you did evil deeds of old, you were cruel and harsh, you ate the flesh and blood of others and so were born as a Yakkha; from henceforth do no murder or the like,&rdquo; so telling the blessings of virtue and the misery of vice, he established the Yakkha in the five precepts; then he said: &ldquo;Why dwell in the forest? Come, I will settle you by the city gate and make you get the best rice.&rdquo; So he went away with the Yakkha, making him take the sword and the other things, and came to Benares. They told the king that Sutana was come with the Yakkha. The king with his ministers <span class="t18">{3.330}</span> went out to meet the Bodhisatta, settled the Yakkha at the city gate and made him get the best rice; then he entered the town, made proclamation by drum, and calling a meeting of the townsfolk spoke the praises of the Bodhisatta and gave him the command of the army; himself was established in the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s teaching, did the good works of generosity and the other virtues, and became destined for heaven.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, After the Truths, the monk who supported his mother was established in the fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time the Yakkha was Aṅgulimāla, the king Ānanda, the youth myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;How will the old folks.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.204] </span><span class="t30">The Teacher told this when dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a monk who supported his mother.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">They say that there was a wealthy merchant at Sāvatthi, who was worth eighteen crores; and he had a son who was very dear and winning to his father and mother. One day the youth went upon the terrace of the house, and opened a window and looked down on the street; and when he saw the great crowd going to Jetavana with perfumes and garlands in their hands to hear the Dhamma preached, he exclaimed that he would go too.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So having ordered perfumes and garlands to be brought, he went to the monastery, and having distributed robes, medicines, drinks, etc. to the assembly and honoured the Fortunate One with perfumes and garlands, he sat down on one side. After hearing the Dhamma, and perceiving the evil consequences of desire and the blessings arising from adopting the ascetic life, when the assembly broke up he asked the Fortunate One for ordination, but he was told that the Tathāgatas do not ordain anyone who has not obtained the permission of his parents; so he went away, and lived a week without food, and having at last obtained his parents&rsquo; consent, he returned and begged for ordination. The Teacher sent a monk who ordained him; and after he was ordained he obtained great honour and gain; he won the favour of his teachers and preceptors, and having received full orders he mastered the Dhamma in five years.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Then he thought to himself, &ldquo;I live here distracted &ndash; it is not suitable for me,&rdquo; and he became anxious to reach the goal of spiritual insight; so having obtained instruction in meditation from his teacher, he departed to a frontier village and dwelt in the forest, and there having entered a course of insight, however much he laboured and strove for twelve years, he failed to attain any special insight.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">His parents also, as time went on, became poor, for those who hired their land or carried on merchandise for them, finding out that there was no son or brother in the family to enforce the payment, seized what they could lay their hands upon and ran away as they pleased, and the servants and labourers in the house seized the gold and coin and made off therewith, so that at the end the two were reduced to an evil plight and had not even a jug for pouring water; and at last they sold their dwelling, and finding themselves homeless, and in extreme misery, they wandered begging for alms, clothed in rags and carrying potsherds in their hands.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now at that time a monk came from Jetavana to the son&rsquo;s place of abode; he performed the duties of hospitality and, as he sat quietly, he first asked whence he was come; and learning that he was come from Jetavana he asked after the health of the Teacher and the principal disciples and then asked for news of his parents, &ldquo;Tell me, sir, about the welfare of such and such a merchant&rsquo;s family in Sāvatthi.&rdquo; &ldquo;O friend, don&rsquo;t ask for news of that family.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;They say that there was one son in that family, but he has become an ascetic in this dispensation, and since he left the world that family has gone to ruin; and at the present time the two old people are reduced to a most lamentable state and beg for alms.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When he heard the other&rsquo;s words he could not remain unmoved, but began to weep with his eyes full of tears, and when the other asked him why he wept, &ldquo;O sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;they are my own father and mother, I am their son.&rdquo; &ldquo;O friend, your father and mother have come to ruin through you &ndash; do you go and take care of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;For twelve years,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;I have laboured and striven but never been able to attain the Path or the Fruit; I must be incompetent; what have I to do with the ascetic life? I will become a householder and will support my parents and give away my wealth, and will thus eventually become destined for heaven.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">So having determined he gave up his abode in the forest to the elder, and the next day departed and by successive stages reached the monastery at the back of Jetavana which is not far from Sāvatthi. There he found two roads, one leading to Jetavana, the other to Sāvatthi. As he stood there, he thought: &ldquo;Shall I see my parents first or the One with Ten Powers?&rdquo; Then he said to himself, &ldquo;In old days I saw my parents for a long time, from henceforth I shall rarely have the chance of seeing the Buddha; I will see the Fully Awakened One today and hear the Dhamma, and then tomorrow morning I will see my parents.&rdquo; So he left the road to Sāvatthi and in the evening arrived at Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now that very day at daybreak, the Teacher, as he looked upon the world, had seen the potentialities of this young man, and when he came to visit him he praised the virtues of parents in the Mātiposakasutta [SN 7.19]. As he stood at the end of the assembly of elders and listened, he thought: &ldquo;If I become a householder I can support my parents; but the Teacher also says, &lsquo;A son who has become an ascetic can be helpful,&rsquo; I went away before without seeing the Teacher, and I failed in such an imperfect ordination; I will now support my parents while still remaining an ascetic without becoming a householder.&rdquo; So he took his ticket and his ticket-food and gruel, and felt as if he had committed a wrong deserving expulsion after a solitary abode of twelve years in the forest. In the morning he went to Sāvatthi and he thought to himself, &ldquo;Shall I first get the gruel or see my parents?&rdquo; He reflected that it would not be right to visit them in their poverty empty-handed; so he first got the gruel and then went to the door of their old house.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">When he saw them sitting by the opposite wall after having gone their round for the alms given in broth, he stood not far from them in a sudden burst of sorrow with his eyes full of tears. They saw him but knew him not; then his mother, thinking that it was someone standing for alms, said to him, &ldquo;We have nothing fit to be given to you, be pleased to pass on.&rdquo; When he heard her, he repressed the grief which filled his heart and remained still standing as before with his eyes full of tears, and when he was addressed a second and a third time he still continued standing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">At last the father said to the mother, &ldquo;Go to him; can this be your son?&rdquo; She rose and went to him and, recognising him, fell at his feet and lamented, and the father also joined his lamentations, and there was a loud outburst of sorrow. To see his parents he could not control himself, but burst into tears; then, after yielding to his feelings, he said: &ldquo;Do not grieve, I will support you,&rdquo; so having comforted them and made them drink some gruel, and sit down on one side, he went again and begged for some food and gave it to them, and then went and asked for alms for himself, and having finished his meal, took up his abode at a short distance off.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">From that day forward he watched over his parents in this manner; he gave them all the alms he received for himself, even those at the fortnightly distributions, and he went on separate expeditions for his own alms, and ate them; and whatever food he received as provision for the rainy season he gave to them, while he took their worn-out garments and dyed them with the doors fast closed and used them himself; but the days were few when he gained alms and there were many when he failed to win anything, and his inner and outer clothing became very rough.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">As he watched over his parents he gradually grew very pale and thin and his friends and intimates said to him, &ldquo;Your complexion used to be bright, but now you have become very pale &ndash; has some illness come upon you?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;No illness has come upon me, but a hindrance has befallen me,&rdquo; and he told them the history. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;the Teacher does not allow us to waste the offerings of the faithful, you do an unlawful act in giving to laymen the offerings of the faithful.&rdquo; When he heard this he shrank away ashamed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">But not satisfied with this they went and told it to the Teacher, saying: &ldquo;So and so, sir, has wasted the offerings of the faithful and used them to feed laymen.&rdquo; The Teacher sent for the young man of family and said to him, &ldquo;Is it true that you, an ascetic, take the offerings of the faithful and support laymen with them?&rdquo; He confessed that it was true. Then the Teacher, wishing to praise what he had done and to declare an old action of his own, said: &ldquo;When you support laymen whom do you support?&rdquo; &ldquo;My parents,&rdquo; he answered. Then the Teacher, wishing to encourage him still more said: &ldquo;Well done, well done,&rdquo; three times, &ldquo;You are in a path which I have traversed before you; I in old time, while going the round for alms, supported my parents.&rdquo; The ascetic was encouraged thereby. At the request of the monks the Teacher, to make known his former actions, told them a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born of a vulture. When he grew up he put his parents, now old and dim of eye, in a vulture&rsquo;s cave and fed them by bringing them flesh of cows and the like. At the time a certain hunter laid snares for vultures all about a Benares cemetery. One day the Bodhisatta seeking for flesh came to the cemetery and caught his foot in the snares. He did not think of himself, but remembered his old parents. &ldquo;How will my parents live now? I think they will die, ignorant that I am caught, helpless and destitute, wasting away in that hill-cave,&rdquo; so lamenting he spoke the first verse;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;How will the old folks manage now within the mountain cave?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">For I am fastened in a snare, cruel Nilīya&rsquo;s slave.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.331}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The son of a hunter, hearing him lament, spoke the second verse, the vulture spoke the third, and so on alternately;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Vulture, what strange laments of yours are these my ears that reach?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I never heard or saw a bird that uttered human speech.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;I tend my aged parents within a mountain cave,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How will the old folks manage now that I&rsquo;ve become your slave?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Carrion a vulture sights across a hundred leagues of land;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Why do you fail to see a snare and net so close at hand?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;When ruin comes upon a man, and fates his death demand,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">He fails to see a snare or net although so close at hand.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Go, tend your aged parents within their mountain cave,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Go, visit them in peace, you have from me the leave you crave.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;O hunter, happiness be thine, with all your kith and kin;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ll tend my aged parents their mountain cave within.&rdquo;</span></p>

The Buddha tells a story of two otters who couldn&rsquo;t agree on the division of a fish, and asked a jackal to help.

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Friend Anutīracārī.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.205] </span><span class="t30">The Teacher told this while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning Upananda, of the Sakya tribe. He was ordained in the dispensation, but forsook the virtues of contentment and the rest and became very greedy. At the beginning of the Rains Retreat he tried two or three monasteries, leaving at one an umbrella or a shoe, at one a walking-stick or a waterpot, and dwelling in one himself. He began the Rains Retreat in a country monastery, and saying: &ldquo;The monks must live contentedly,&rdquo; explained to the monks, as if he were making the moon rise in the sky, the way to the noble state of content, praising contentment with the necessaries. Hearing him the monks threw away their pleasant robes and vessels, and took pots of clay and robes of dust-rags. He put the others in his own lodging, and when the Rains Retreat and the Invitation festival were over he filled a cart and went to Jetavana.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9492"></a><span class="t30">On the way, behind a monastery in the forest, wrapping his feet with creepers and saying: &ldquo;Surely something can be got here,&rdquo; he entered the monastery. Two old monks had spent the Rains Retreat there; they had got two coarse cloaks and one fine blanket, and, as they could not divide them, they were pleased to see him, thinking: &ldquo;This elder will divide these between us,&rdquo; and said: &ldquo;Sir, we cannot divide this which is raiment for the Rains Retreat; we have a dispute about it, do you divide it between us.&rdquo; He consented and giving the two coarse cloaks to them he took the blanket, saying: &ldquo;This falls to me who know the rules of discipline,&rdquo; and went away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">These elders, who loved the blanket, went with him to Jetavana, and told the matter to the monks who knew the rules, saying: &ldquo;Is it right for those who know the rules to devour plunder thus?&rdquo; The monks seeing the pile of robes and bowls brought by the elder Upananda, said: &ldquo;Sir, you have great merit, you have gained much food and raiment.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Sirs, where is my merit? I gained this in such and such a manner,&rdquo; telling them all.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">In the Dhamma Hall they raised a talk, saying: &ldquo;Sirs, Upananda, of the Sakya tribe, is very covetous and greedy.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.333}</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher, finding their subject, said: &ldquo;Monks, Upananda&rsquo;s deeds are not suited for progress; when a monk explains progress to another he should first act suitably himself and then preach to others.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Yourself first establish in propriety,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Then teach; the wise should not self-seeking be. [Dhp. 158]</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">By this verse of the Dhammapada he showed the Dhamma and said: &ldquo;Monks, Upananda is not covetous for the first time; he was so before and he plundered men&rsquo;s property before,&rdquo; and so he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a Tree Devatā by a riverbank. A jackal, named Māyāvī, had taken a wife and lived in a place by that riverbank. One day his mate said to him, &ldquo;Husband, a longing has come upon me; I desire to eat a fresh rohita fish.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Be easy, I will bring it you,&rdquo; and <span class="t18">[3.206] </span>going by the river he wrapped his feet in creepers, and went along the bank. At the moment, two otters, Gambhīracārī and Anutīracārī, were standing on the bank looking for fish. Gambhīracārī saw a great rohita fish, and entering the water with a bound he took it by the tail. The fish was strong and dragging him went away. He called to the other, &ldquo;This great fish will be enough for both of us, come and aid me,&rdquo; speaking the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Friend Anutīracārī, rush to my aid, I pray;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I&rsquo;ve caught a great fish; but by force he&rsquo;s carrying me away.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.334}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing him, the other spoke the second verse;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Gambhīracārī, luck to you! Your grip be firm and stout,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">As Supaṇṇa would lift a snake, I&rsquo;ll lift the fellow out.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the two together took out the rohita fish, laid him on the ground and killed him; but saying each to the other, &ldquo;You divide him,&rdquo; they quarrelled and could not divide him; and so sat down, leaving him. At the moment the jackal came to the spot. Seeing him, they both saluted him and said: &ldquo;Lord of the grey grass-colour, this fish was taken by both of us together; a dispute arose because we could not divide him; do you make an equal division and part it,&rdquo; speaking the third verse;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;A strife arose between us, mark! O you of grassy hue,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let our contention, honoured sir, be settled fair by you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The jackal hearing them, said, declaring his own strength;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve arbitrated many a case and done it peacefully;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Let your contention, honoured sirs, be settled fair by me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Having spoken that verse, and making the division, he spoke this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Tail, Anutīracārī; Gambhīracārī, head;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The middle to the arbiter will properly be paid.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.335}</span></p>
<p class="p6">So having divided the fish, he said: &ldquo;You eat head and tail without quarrelling,&rdquo; and seizing the middle portion in his mouth he ran away before their eyes. They sat downcast, as if they had lost a thousand pieces, and spoke the sixth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;But for our strife, it would have long sufficed us without fail;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But now the jackal takes the fish, and leaves us head and tail.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The jackal was pleased and thinking: &ldquo;Now I will give my wife rohita fish to eat,&rdquo; he went to her. She saw him coming and saluting him spoke a verse;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Even as a king is glad to join a kingdom to his rule,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">So I am glad to see my lord today with his mouth full.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.207]</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then she asked him about the means of attainment, speaking a verse;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;How, being of the land, have you from water caught a fish?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">How did you do the feat, my lord? Pray answer to my wish.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The jackal, explaining the means to her, spoke the next verse;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">9. &ldquo;By strife it is their weakness comes, by strife their means decay;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By strife the otters lost their prize; Māyāvī, eat the prey.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.336}</span></p>
<p class="p6">There is another verse spoken after Fully Awakening:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">10. &ldquo;Even so when strife arises among men,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">They seek an arbiter; he&rsquo;s leader then;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Their wealth decays, and the king&rsquo;s coffers gain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, &ldquo;At that time the jackal was Upananda, the otters the two old men, the Tree Devatā who witnessed the cause was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Dasaṇṇa&rsquo;s good sword.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> The Teacher told this, when living in Jetavana, concerning the temptation of a monk by his wife when a layman. The monk confessed that he was discontent for this reason. The Teacher said: &ldquo;That woman does you harm; formerly too you were dying of mental sickness owing to her, and got life owing to wise men,&rdquo; and so he told a story of the past. </span><span class="t18">{3.337}</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when the great king Maddava was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin household. They called his name young Senaka. When he grew up he learned all the sciences at Taxila, and coming back to Benares he became king Maddava&rsquo;s counsellor in things temporal and spiritual, and being called wise Senaka he was looked upon in all the city as the sun or the moon.</p>
<p class="p7">The son of the king&rsquo;s household priest came to wait on the king and seeing the chief queen adorned with all ornaments and exceedingly beautiful, he became enamoured, and <span class="t18">[3.208] </span>when he went home lay without taking food. His comrades enquired of him and he told them the matter. The king said: &ldquo;The household priest&rsquo;s son does not appear, how is this?&rdquo; When he heard the cause, he sent for him and said: &ldquo;I give her to you for seven days, spend those days at your house and on the eighth send her back.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and taking her to his house took delight with her. They became enamoured of each other, and keeping it secret they fled by the house door and came to the country of another king. No man knew the place they went to, and their path was like the way of a ship. The king made proclamation by drum round the city, and though he sought in many ways he did not find the place whither she had gone. Then great sorrow for her fell upon him; his heart became hot and poured out blood; after that blood flowed from his entrails, and his sickness became great. The great royal physicians could not cure him.</p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta thought: &ldquo;The disease is not in the king, he is touched by mental sickness because he sees not his wife; I will cure him by a certain means,&rdquo; so he instructed the king&rsquo;s wise counsellors, Āyura and Pukkusa by name, saying: &ldquo;The king has no sickness, except mental sickness because he sees not the queen; now he is a great helper to us and we will cure him by a certain means; <span class="t18">{3.338}</span> we will have a gathering in the palace-yard and make a man who knows how to do it swallow a sword; we will put the king at a window and make him look down on the gathering; the king seeing the man swallow a sword will ask, &ldquo;Is there anything harder than that?&rdquo; Then, my lord Āyura, you should make answer, &ldquo;It is harder to say, &lsquo;I give up so and so,&rsquo; then he will ask you, my lord Pukkusa, and you should make answer, &lsquo;O king, if a man says, &ldquo;I give up so and so&rdquo; and does not give it, his word is fruitless, no men live or eat or drink by such words; but they who do according to that word and give the thing according to their promise, they do a thing harder than the other;&rsquo; then I will find what to do next.&rdquo; So he made a gathering.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9502"></a>Then these three wise men went and told the king, saying: &ldquo;O great king, there is a gathering in the palace-yard; if men look down on it their sorrow becomes joy, let us go there,&rdquo; so they took the king, and opening a window made him look down on the gathering. Many people were showing off each his own are which he knew; and a man was swallowing a good sword of thirty-three inches and sharp of edge. The king seeing him thought: &ldquo;This man is swallowing the sword, I will ask these wise men if there is anything harder than that,&rdquo; so he asked Āyura, speaking the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Dasaṇṇa&rsquo;s</span><a id="a9503"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15632"><span class="t19">{664}</span></a><span class="t12"> good sword thirsts for blood, its edge is sharpened perfectly;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Yet &rsquo;midst the crowd he swallows it; a harder feat there cannot be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I ask if anything is hard compared to this; pray answer me.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.209] {3.339}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then he spoke the second verse in answer:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Greed may lure a man to swallow swords though sharpened perfectly;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But to say, I give this freely, that a harder feat would be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All things else are easy; royal Māgadha, I&rsquo;ve answered you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the king heard wise Āyura&rsquo;s words, he thought: &ldquo;So then it is harder to say, &ldquo;I give this thing,&rdquo; than to swallow a sword; I said: &ldquo;I give my queen to the priest&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; I have done a very hard thing,&rdquo; and so his sorrow at heart became a little lighter. Then thinking: &ldquo;Is there anything harder than to say, &lsquo;I give this thing to another?&rsquo; &rdquo; he talked with wise Pukkusa and spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;Āyura has solved my question, wise in all philosophy;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Pukkusa I ask the question now, if harder feat there be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is there aught that&rsquo;s hard compared to this? Pray answer me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The wise Pukkusa in answer to him spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Not by words men live, and not by language uttered fruitlessly;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">But to give and not regret it, that a greater feat would be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All things else are easy; royal Māgadha, I&rsquo;ve answered you.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.340}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king, hearing this, considered, &ldquo;I first said, &lsquo;I will give the queen to the priest&rsquo;s son,&rsquo; and then I did according to my word and gave her; surely I have done a hard thing,&rdquo; so his sorrow became lighter. Then it came into his mind, &ldquo;There is no one wiser than wise Senaka, I will ask this question of him,&rdquo; and asking him he spoke the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Pukkusa has solved my question, wise in all philosophy;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Senaka I ask the question now, if harder feat there be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Is there aught that&rsquo;s hard compared to this? Pray answer me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So Senaka spoke the sixth verse in answer to him;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;If a man should give a gift, or small or great, in generosity,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Nor regret the giving after; that a harder feat would be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">All things else are easy; royal Māgadha, I&rsquo;ve answered you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king, hearing the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s words, reflected: &ldquo;I gave the queen to the priest&rsquo;s son of my own thought; <span class="t18">{3.341}</span> now I cannot control my thought, I sorrow and pine; this is not worthy of me. If she loved me she would not forsake her kingdom and flee away; what have I to do with her when she has not loved me but fled away?&rdquo; As he thought thus, all his sorrow rolled away and departed like a drop of water on a lotus leaf. That instant his entrails were at rest. He became well and happy, and praised the Bodhisatta, speaking the final verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Āyura answered question, good Pukkusa as well;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">The words of Senaka the wise all answers do excel.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">And after this praise he gave him much wealth in his delight. <span class="t18">[3.210]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka, after the Truths, the discontented monk was established in the fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time the queen was the wife of his layman days, the king the discontented monk, Āyura was Moggallāna, Pukkusa was Sāriputta, and the wise Senaka was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a9513"></a><a id="a9514"></a><span class="t34">One day the monks sat in the Dhamma Hall and described the Tathāgata&rsquo;s Perfection of Wisdom, &ldquo;Monks, the Tathāgata is greatly wise, his wisdom is vast, ready, swift, sharp, crushing heretical doctrines, after having converted, by the power of his own knowledge, the brahmins Kūṭadanta and the rest, the ascetics Sabhiya and the rest, the thieves Aṅgulimāla and the rest, the Yakkhas Āḷavaka and the rest, the Devas Sakka and the rest, and the Brahmās Baka and the rest, made them humble, and ordained a vast multitude as ascetics and established them in the fruition of the paths of sanctification.&rdquo; The Teacher came up and asked what they were discoursing about, and when they told him, he replied, &ldquo;Not only now is the Tathāgata full of wisdom. In former days, even when his knowledge was immature, he was wise, as he went about for the sake of wisdom and knowledge,&rdquo; and then he told a story of the past.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past a king called Janaka was reigning in Benares. At that time the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family, and they called his name young Senaka. When he grew up he learned all the arts at Taxila, and returning to Benares saw the king. The king set him in the place of minister and gave him great glory. <span class="t18">{3.342}</span><a id="a9515"></a> He taught the king things temporal and spiritual. Being a pleasant preacher of the Dhamma he established the king in the five precepts, in alms-giving, in keeping the fasts, in the ten ways of right action, and so established him in the path of virtue. Throughout the kingdom it was as it were the time of the appearing of the Buddhas. On the fortnightly fast the king, the viceroys and others would all assemble and decorate the place of meeting. The Bodhisatta taught the Dhamma in a decorated room in the middle of a deer-skin-couch with the power of a Buddha, and his word was like the preaching of Buddhas.</p>
<p class="p7">Then a certain old brahmin begging for money-alms got a thousand pieces, left them in a brahmin family and went to seek alms again. When he had gone, that family spent all his pieces. He came back and would have his pieces brought him. The brahmin, being unable to give them to him, gave him his daughter to wife. The other brahmin took her and made his dwelling in a brahmin village not far from Benares. Because of her youth his wife was unsatisfied in desires and did wrong with another young brahmin.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9516"></a>There are sixteen things that cannot be satisfied; and what are these sixteen? The sea is not satisfied with all rivers, nor <span class="t18">[3.211] </span>the fire with fuel, nor a king with his kingdom, nor a fool with defilements, nor a woman with three things, intercourse, adornment and child-bearing, nor a brahmin with sacred texts, nor a sage with Absorption, nor one still in training<a id="a9517"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15634"><span class="t9">{665}</span></a><a id="a9518"></a><a id="a9519"></a> with honour, nor one free from desire with penance, nor the energetic man with energy, nor the talker with talk, nor the politic man with the council, nor the believer with serving the Saṅgha, nor the liberal man with giving away, nor the learned with hearing the Dhamma, nor the four assemblies<a id="a9520"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15636"><span class="t9">{666}</span></a> with seeing the Buddha.</p>
<p class="p7">So this brahmin woman, <span class="t18">{3.343}</span> being unsatisfied with intercourse, wished to put her husband away and do her wrong with boldness. So one day in her evil purpose she lay down. When he said: &ldquo;How is it, wife?&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;Brahmin, I cannot do the work of your house, get me a maid.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wife, I have no money, what shall I give to get her?&rdquo; &ldquo;Seek for money by begging for alms and so get her.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, wife, get ready something for my journey.&rdquo; She filled a skin-bag with baked meal and unbaked meal, and gave them to him. The brahmin, going through villages, towns and cities, got seven hundred pieces, and thinking: &ldquo;This money is enough to buy slaves, male and female,&rdquo; he was returning to his own village; at a certain place convenient for water he opened his sack, and eating some meal he went down to drink water without tying the mouth. Then a black snake in a hollow tree, smelling the meal, entered the bag and lay down in a coil eating the meal. The brahmin came, and without looking inside fastened the sack and putting it on his shoulder went his way.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9521"></a><a id="a9522"></a>Then a Devatā living in a tree, sitting in a hollow of the trunk, said to him on the way, &ldquo;Brahmin, if you stop on the way you will die, if you go home today your wife will die,&rdquo; and vanished. He looked, but not seeing the Devatā was afraid and troubled with the fear of death, and so came to the gate of Benares weeping and lamenting. It was the fast on the fifteenth day, the day of the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s preaching, seated on the decorated Dhamma seat, and a multitude with perfumes and flowers and the like in their hands came in troops to hear the preaching. The brahmin said: &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; and was told, &ldquo;O brahmin, today wise Senaka preaches the Dhamma with sweet voice and the power of a Buddha; do you not know?&rdquo; He thought: &ldquo;They say he is a wise preacher, and I am troubled with the fear of death; wise men <span class="t18">{3.344}</span><a id="a9523"></a> are able to take away even great sorrow; it is right for me too to go there and hear the Dhamma.&rdquo; So he went with them, and when the assembly and the king among them had sat down round about the Bodhisatta, he stood at the outside, not far from the Dhamma seat, with his mealsack on his shoulder, afraid with the fear of death. The Bodhisatta preached as if he were bringing down the river of heaven or showering ambrosia. The multitude became well pleased, and making applause listened to the <span class="t18">[3.212] </span>preaching.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9524"></a>Wise men have far sight. At that moment the Bodhisatta, opening his eyes gracious with the five graces, surveyed the assembly on every side and, seeing that brahmin, thought: &ldquo;This great assembly has become well pleased and listens to the Dhamma, making applause, but that one brahmin is ill pleased and weeps; there must be some sorrow within him to cause his tears; as if touching rust with acid, or making a drop of water roll from a lotus leaf, I will teach him the Dhamma, making him free from sorrow and well pleased in mind.&rdquo; So he called him, &ldquo;Brahmin, I am wise Senaka, now will I make you free from sorrow, speak boldly,&rdquo; and so talking with him he spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;You are confused in thought, disturbed in sense,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Tears streaming from thine eyes are evidence;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">What have you lost, or what do wish to gain</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">By coming hither? Give me answer plain.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.345}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Then the brahmin, declaring his cause of sorrow, spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;If I go home my wife it is must die,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">If I go not, the Yakkha said, &rsquo;tis I;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That is the thought that pierces cruelly;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Explain the matter, Senaka, to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The Bodhisatta, hearing the brahmin&rsquo;s words, spread the net of knowledge as if throwing a net in the sea, thinking: &ldquo;There are many causes of death to beings in this world; some die sunk in the sea, or seized therein by ravenous fish, some falling in the Ganges, or seized by crocodiles, some falling from a tree or pierced by a thorn, some struck by weapons of divers kinds, some by eating poison or hanging or falling from a precipice or by extreme cold or attacked by diseases of diverse kinds, so they die; now among so many causes of death from which cause shall this brahmin die if he stays on the road today, or his wife if he goes home?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">As he considered, he saw the sack on the brahmin&rsquo;s shoulder and thought: &ldquo;There must be a snake who has gone into that sack, and entering he must have gone in from the smell of the meal when the brahmin at his breakfast had eaten some meal and gone to drink water without fastening the sack&rsquo;s mouth; the brahmin coming back after drinking water must have gone on after fastening and taking up the sack without seeing that the snake had entered; <span class="t18">{3.346}</span> if he stays on the road, he will say at evening when he rests, &ldquo;I will eat some meal,&rdquo; and opening the sack will put in his hand; then the snake will bite him in the hand and destroy his life; this will be the cause of his death if he stays on the road; but if he goes home the sack will come into his wife&rsquo;s hand; she will say, &lsquo;I will look at the ware within,&rsquo; and opening the sack put in her hand, then the snake will bite her and destroy her life, and this will be the cause of her death if he goes home today.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">This he knew by his skill in means. Then this <span class="t18">[3.213] </span>came into his mind, &ldquo;The snake must be a black snake, brave and fearless; when the sack strikes against the brahmin&rsquo;s broadside, he shows no motion or quivering; he shows no sign of his being there amidst such an assembly; therefore he must be a black snake, brave and fearless,&rdquo; from his skill in means he knew this as if he was seeing with a divine eye. So as if he had been a man who had stood by and seen the snake enter the sack, deciding by his skill in means, the Bodhisatta answering the brahmin&rsquo;s question in the royal assembly spoke the third verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;First with many a doubt I deal,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Now my tongue the truth declares;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brahmin, in your bag of meal</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">A snake has entered unawares.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.347}</span></p>
<p class="p6">So saying, he asked, &ldquo;O brahmin, is there any meal in that sack of yours?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is, O sage.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you eat some meal today at your breakfast time?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, O sage.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where were you sitting?&rdquo; &ldquo;In a wood, at the root of a tree.&rdquo; &ldquo;When you ate the meal, and went to drink water, did you fasten the sack&rsquo;s mouth or not?&rdquo; &ldquo;I did not, O sage.&rdquo; &ldquo;When you drank water and came back, did you fasten the sack after looking in?&rdquo; &ldquo;I fastened it without looking in, O sage.&rdquo; &ldquo;O brahmin, when you went to drink water, I think the snake entered the sack owing to the smell of the meal without your knowledge, such is the case, therefore put down your sack, set it in the midst of the assembly and opening the mouth, stand back and taking a stick beat the sack with it; then when you see a black snake coming out with its hood spread and hissing, you will have no doubt,&rdquo; so he spoke the fourth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. &ldquo;Take a stick and beat the sack,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Dumb and double-tongued is he;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Cease your mind with doubts to rack;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Open sack, the snake you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">The brahmin, hearing the Great Being&rsquo;s words, did so, though alarmed and frightened. The snake came out of the sack when his hood was struck with the stick, and stood looking at the crowd. <span class="t18">{3.348}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Teacher, explaining the matter, spoke the fifth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. &ldquo;Frightened, &rsquo;midst the assembled rout,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">String of meal-sack he untied;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Angry crept a serpent out,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hood erect, in all his pride.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the snake came out with hood erect, there was a forecast of the Bodhisatta as the omniscient Buddha. The multitude began waving cloths and snapping fingers in thousands, the showers of the seven precious stones were as showers from a thick cloud, cries of &lsquo;good&rsquo; were raised in hundreds of thousands, <span class="t18">[3.214]</span><span class="t23"> </span>and the noise was like the splitting of the earth. This answering of such a question with the power of a Buddha is not the power of birth, nor the power of men rich in gifts and high family; of what is it the power then? Of knowledge; the man of knowledge makes spiritual insight to increase, opens the door of the noble Paths, enters the great and endless Nibbāna and masters the perfection of disciplehood, Paccekabuddhahood, and perfect Buddhahood; knowledge is the best among the qualities that bring the great and endless Nibbāna, the rest are the attendants of knowledge; and so it is said;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&ldquo;Wisdom is best, the good confess,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Like the moon in starry skies;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Virtue, fortune, righteousness,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Are the handmaids of the wise.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When the question had been so answered by the Bodhisatta, a certain snake-charmer made a mouth-band for the snake, caught him and let him loose in the forest. The brahmin, coming up to the king, saluted him and made obeisance, and praising him spoke half a verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6a. &ldquo;Great, king Janaka, your gain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Seeing Senaka the wise.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.349}</span></p>
<p class="p6">After praising the king, he took seven hundred pieces from the bag and praising the Bodhisatta, he spoke a verse and a half wishing to give a gift in delight;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6b. &ldquo;Dread your wisdom; veils are vain,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Brahmin, to your piercing eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. These seven hundred pieces, see,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Take them all, I give them you;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">&rsquo;Tis to you I owe my life,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">And the welfare of my wife.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing this, the Bodhisatta spoke the eighth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">8. &ldquo;For reciting poetry</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Wise men can&rsquo;t accept a wage;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Rather let us give to you,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ere you take the homeward stage.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">So saying, the Bodhisatta made a full thousand pieces to be given to the brahmin, and asked him, &ldquo;By whom were you sent to beg for money?&rdquo; &ldquo;By my wife, O sage.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.350}</span> &ldquo;Is your wife old or young?&rdquo; &ldquo;Young, O sage.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then she is doing wrong with another, and sent you away thinking to do so in security; if you take these pieces home, she will give to her lover the pieces won by your labour; therefore you should not go home straight, but only after leaving the pieces outside the town at the root of a tree or somewhere,&rdquo; so he sent him away.</p>
<p class="p7">He, coming near the village, left his pieces at the root of a tree, and came home in the evening. His wife at that moment was seated with her lover. The brahmin stood at the door and said: &ldquo;Wife.&rdquo; She recognised his voice, and putting out the light <span class="t18">[3.215] </span>opened the door; when the brahmin came in, she took the other and put him at the door; then coming back and not seeing anything in the sack she asked, &ldquo;Brahmin, what alms have you got on your journey?&rdquo; &ldquo;A thousand pieces.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is left at such and such a place; never mind, we will get it tomorrow.&rdquo; She went and told her lover. He went and took it as if it were his own treasure.</p>
<p class="p7">Next day the brahmin went, and not seeing the pieces came to the Bodhisatta, who said: &ldquo;What is the matter, brahmin?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the pieces, O sage.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you tell your wife?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, O sage.&rdquo; Knowing that the wife had told her lover, the Bodhisatta asked, &ldquo;Brahmin, is there a brahmin who is a friend of your wife&rsquo;s?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is, O sage.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is there one who is a friend of yours?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, O sage.&rdquo; Then the Great Being caused seven days&rsquo; expenses to be given him and said: &ldquo;Go, do you two invite and entertain the first day fourteen brahmins, seven for yourself and seven for your wife; from next day onwards take one less each day, till on the seventh day you invite one brahmin and your wife one; then if you notice that the brahmin your wife asks on the seventh day has come every time, tell me.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{3.351}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The brahmin did so, and told the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;O sage, I have observed the brahmin who is always our guest.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta sent men with him to bring that other brahmin, and asked him, &ldquo;Did you take a thousand pieces belonging to this brahmin from the root of such and such a tree?&rdquo; &ldquo;I did not, O sage.&rdquo; &ldquo;You do not know that I am the wise Senaka; I will make you fetch those pieces.&rdquo; He was afraid and confessed, saying: &ldquo;I took them.&rdquo; &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; &ldquo;I put them in such and such a place, O sage.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta asked the first brahmin, &ldquo;Brahmin, will you keep your wife or take another?&rdquo; &ldquo;Let me keep her, O sage.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta sent men to fetch the pieces and the wife, and gave the brahmin the pieces from the thief&rsquo;s hand; he punished the other, removing him from the city, punished also the wife, and gave great honour to the brahmin, making him dwell near himself.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths, and identified the Jātaka. At the end of the Truths, many attained the fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time the brahmin was Ānanda, the Tree Devatā Sāriputta, the assembly was the Buddha&rsquo;s assembly, and wise Senaka was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Aṭṭhisena, many beggars.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[3.216] </span><span class="t30">The Teacher told this when dwelling in the shrine called Aggāḷava near Āḷavi, concerning the regulations for the building of cells.</span><a id="a9534"></a><a href="notes2.html#a15638"><span class="t9">{667}</span></a><a id="a9535"></a><a id="a9536"></a><a id="a9537"></a><span class="t30"> The occasion was told in the Maṇikaṇṭhajātaka [Ja 253] above.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9538"></a><span class="t34">Some monks who lived in Āḷavī were begging from all quarters the materials for houses which they were getting made for themselves. They were for ever asking, &ldquo;Give us a man, give us somebody to do servant&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; and so forth. Everybody was annoyed at this begging and solicitation. So much annoyed were they, that at sight of these monks they were startled and scared away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">It happened that the venerable monk Mahākassapa entered Āḷavī, and traversed the place in quest of alms. The people, as soon as they saw the elder, ran away as before. After mealtime, having returned from his rounds, he summoned the monks, and thus addressed them, &ldquo;Once Āḷavī was a good place for alms; why is it so poor now?&rdquo; They told him the reason.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t34">Now the Fortunate One was at the time dwelling at the Aggāḷava shrine. The elder came to the Fortunate One, and told him all about it. The Teacher convened the monks touching this matter. &ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you are building houses and worrying everybody for help. Is this true?&rdquo; They said it was.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The Teacher addressed the monks, saying: &ldquo;Monks, formerly </span><span class="t18">{3.352}</span><span class="t30"> before Buddha was born in the world, monastics of other dispensations, even though offered their choice by kings, never asked for alms, holding that begging from others was not agreeable or pleasant,&rdquo; and so he told a story of the past time.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin household in a certain village, and they called his name young Aṭṭhisena. When he grew up, he learned all the arts at Taxila, and afterwards seeing the misery of desires he took the ascetic life, and reaching the Absorptions, Super Knowledges and Attainments, he dwelt long in the Himālayas; then coming down among men to get salt and vinegar, he reached Benares, and after staying in a garden he came for alms the next day to the king&rsquo;s court. The king, being pleased with his bearing and manner, sent for him, and sat him on a seat on the terrace, giving him good food; then receiving his thanks he was pleased, and exacting a promise, made the Bodhisatta dwell in the royal garden, and went to wait on him two or three times each day.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a9539"></a>One day, being pleased with his preaching of the Dhamma, he gave him a choice, saying: &ldquo;Tell me whatever you desire, beginning from my kingdom.&rdquo; The Bodhisatta did not say, &ldquo;Give me so and so.&rdquo; Others ask for whatever they desire, saying: &ldquo;Give me this,&rdquo; and the king gives it, if not attached to it. One day the king thought: &ldquo;Other suitors and mendicants ask me to give them so and so; but the noble Aṭṭhisena, ever since I offered him a choice, asks for nothing; he is wise and has skill in means; I will ask him.&rdquo; So one day after the early meal he sat on one side, and asking him as to the cause of other men&rsquo;s making suits and his own making none, he spoke the first verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. &ldquo;Aṭṭhisena, many beggars, though they&rsquo;re strangers utterly,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Throng to me with their petitions; why have you no suit for me?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[3.217] {3.353}</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing him the Bodhisatta spoke the second verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">2. &ldquo;Neither suitor, nor rejector of a suit, can pleasant be;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">That&rsquo;s the reason, be not angry, why I have no suit to thee.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">Hearing his words the king spoke three verses;</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">3. &ldquo;He who lives by sueing, and has not at proper season sued,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Makes another fall from merit, fails to gain a livelihood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">4. He who lives by sueing, and has aye at proper season sued,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Makes another man win merit, gains himself a livelihood.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">5. Men of wisdom are not angry when they see the suitors throng;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Speak, my holy friend; the boon you ask for can never be wrong.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.354}</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a9540"></a><a id="a9541"></a>So the Bodhisatta, even though given the choice of the kingdom, made no suit. When the king&rsquo;s wish had been so expressed, the Bodhisatta to show him the ascetics&rsquo; way said: &ldquo;O great king, these suits are preferred by men of worldly desires and householders, not by ascetics; from their ordination ascetics must have a pure life unlike a householder,&rdquo; and so showing the ascetics&rsquo; way, he spoke the sixth verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">6. &ldquo;Sages never make petitions, worthy laymen ought to know;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Silent stands the noble suitor; sages make petition so.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{3.355}</span></p>
<p class="p6">The king hearing the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s words said: &ldquo;Sir, if a wise attendant of his own knowledge gives what ought to be given to his friend, so I give to you such and such a thing,&rdquo; and so he spoke the seventh verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">7. &ldquo;Brahmin, I offer you a thousand kine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Red kine, and eke the leader of the herd;</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Hearing but now those generous deeds of thine,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">I too in turn to generous deeds am stirred.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6">When he said this, the Bodhisatta refused, saying: &ldquo;Great king, I took the ascetic life free from defilement; I have no need of cows.&rdquo; The king abode by his admonition; doing alms and other good works he became destined for heaven, and not falling away from his meditation, was reborn in the Brahmā Realm.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After the lesson, the Teacher declared the Truths and identified the Jātaka, After the Truths many were established in the fruition of the First Path. &ldquo;At that time the king was Ānanda, Aṭṭhisena was myself.&rdquo;</span></p>
