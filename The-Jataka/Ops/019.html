<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present 500 friends of Anāthapiṇḍika convert to Buddhism, but later fall away. The Buddha reproves them for failing in their refuge, and tells a story of a wise and a foolish merchant in the past. The foolish one listened to Yakkhas who led him astray, and he lost all his men and merchandise; the wise one safely guided his caravan across the desert.</span></p>

But who, you ask, was it that provoked this tale?</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a764"></a><span class="t30">Well, it was the Treasurer&rsquo;s five hundred friends, disciples of the sectarians.</span><a id="a765"></a><a href="notes.html#a14601"><span class="t9">{188}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a766"></a><span class="t30">For one day Anāthapiṇḍika</span><a id="a767"></a><a href="notes.html#a14603"><span class="t9">{189}</span></a><a id="a768"></a><span class="t30"> the Treasurer took his friends the five hundred disciples of other schools, and went off with them to Jetavana, where also he had a great store brought of garlands, perfumes, and unguents, together with oil, honey, molasses, cloths, and cloaks. After due salutation to the Tathāgata, he made his offering to him of the garlands and the like, and handed over to the Saṅgha of monks the medicinal oil and so forth together with the cloths; and, this done, he took his seat on one side eschewing the six faults in </span><span class="t18">[1.2] </span><span class="t30">sitting down. Likewise, those disciples of other schools saluted the Buddha, and took their seats close by the side of Anāthapiṇḍika &ndash; gazing upon the Teacher&rsquo;s countenance, glorious as the full moon, upon his excellent presence endowed with the signs and marks of Buddhahood and encompassed to a fathom&rsquo;s length with light, and upon the rich glory that marks a Buddha, a glory which issued as it were in paired garlands, pair upon pair.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a769"></a><span class="t30">Then, though in thunderous tones as of a young lion roaring in the Red Valley or as of a storm-cloud in the rainy season, bringing down as it were the Ganges of the Heavens</span><a id="a770"></a><a href="notes.html#a14605"><span class="t9">{190}</span></a><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">{1.96}</span><span class="t30"> and seeming to weave a chaplet of jewels &ndash; yet in a voice of eightfold perfection, the charm of which ravished the ear, he preached to them the Dhamma in a discourse full of sweetness and bright with varied beauty.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a771"></a><span class="t30">They, after hearing the Teacher&rsquo;s discourse, rose up with hearts converted, and with due salutation to the One with Ten Powers, burst asunder the other doctrines in which they had taken refuge, and betook themselves to the Buddha as their refuge. Thenceforth without ceasing they used to go with Anāthapiṇḍika, carrying in their hands perfumes and garlands and the like, to hear the Dhamma in the monastery; and they abounded in generosity, kept the Precepts, and kept the weekly Uposatha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a772"></a><a id="a773"></a><span class="t30">Now the Fortunate One went from Sāvatthi back to Rājagaha again. As soon as the Tathāgata had gone, they burst asunder their new faith, and returning to the other doctrines as their refuge, reverted to their original state.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">After some seven or eight months&rsquo; stay, the Fortunate One came back to Jetavana. Once again too did Anāthapiṇḍika come with those friends of his to the Teacher, make his salutation and offering of perfumes and the like, and take his seat on one side. And the friends also saluted the Fortunate One and took their seats in like manner. Then did Anāthapiṇḍika tell the Fortunate One how, when the Tathāgata had departed on his alms pilgrimage, his friends had forsaken their refuge for the old doctrines again, and had reverted to their original state.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a774"></a><span class="t30">Opening the lotus of his mouth, as though it were a casket of jewels, scented with scents divine and filled with divers perfumes by virtue of his having ever spoken aright throughout myriad aeons, the Fortunate One made his sweet voice come forth, as he enquired, &ldquo;Is the report true that you, disciples, have forsaken the Three Refuges</span><a id="a775"></a><a href="notes.html#a14607"><span class="t9">{191}</span></a><span class="t30"> for the refuge of other doctrines?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a776"></a><span class="t30">And when they, unable to conceal the fact, had confessed, saying: &ldquo;It is true, Fortunate One,&rdquo; then said the Teacher, &ldquo;Disciples, not between the bounds of hell</span><a id="a777"></a><a href="notes.html#a14609"><span class="t9">{192}</span></a><span class="t30"> below and the highest heaven above, not in all the infinite worlds that stretch right and left, is there the equal, much less the superior, of a Buddha in the excellences which spring from obeying the Precepts and from other virtuous conduct.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a778"></a><a id="a779"></a><span class="t30">Then he declared to them the excellences of the Three Jewels as they are revealed in the sacred texts, the following amongst the number, &ldquo;Of all creatures, monks, whether footless and so on, of these the Tathāgata is the chief,&rdquo; &ldquo;Whatsoever riches there be in this or in other worlds and so on,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Verily the chief of the faithful and so on.&rdquo; Thence he went on to say, &ldquo;No disciples, male or female, who seek refuge in the Three Jewels that are endowed with such peerless excellences, are ever reborn into hell and the like states; but, released from all rebirth into states of suffering, they pass to the Realm of Devas and there receive great glory. Therefore, in forsaking such a refuge for that offered by other doctrines, you have gone astray.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[1.3]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">And here the following sacred texts should be cited to make it clear that none who, to find release and the supreme good, have sought refuge in the Three Jewels, shall be reborn into states of suffering: </span><span class="t18">{1.97}</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&ldquo;Those who have refuge in the Buddha found,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><a id="a780"></a><span class="t31">Shall not pass hence to states of suffering;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Straightway, when they shall quit their human frame,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><a id="a781"></a><span class="t31">A Deva form these faithful ones shall fill.</span><a id="a782"></a><a href="notes.html#a14611"><span class="t32">{193}</span></a></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Those who have refuge in the Dhamma found</span><a id="a783"></a><a href="notes.html#a14613"><span class="t32">{194}</span></a></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Shall not pass hence to states of suffering;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Straightway, when they shall quit their human frame,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">A Deva form these faithful ones shall fill.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Those who have refuge in the Saṅgha found</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Shall not pass hence to states of suffering;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Straightway, when they shall quit their human frame,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">A Deva form these faithful ones shall fill.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">To many a refuge men go, to mountains and to forests,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">To shrines and trees and groves, when terrified with fear.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Such is no sure refuge, such is no final refuge;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Not by resorting to such a refuge does a man obtain release from all suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Whoever seeks refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Whoever, with clear understanding, beholds the Four Noble Truths,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Suffering, the Origin of Suffering, the Escape from Suffering,</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">And the Noble Eightfold Path of Escape from Suffering,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">To this sure refuge, to this supreme refuge,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><a id="a784"></a><span class="t31">By resorting to this refuge, he obtains release from all suffering.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a785"></a><span class="t30">But the Teacher did not end his teaching to them at this point; for he went on to say, &ldquo;Disciples, meditation on the thought of the Buddha, meditation on the thought of the Dhamma, meditation on the thought of the Saṅgha, this it is that gives entry to and fruition of the First, the Second, the Third, and the Fourth Paths to Bliss.&rdquo;</span><a id="a786"></a><a href="notes.html#a14615"><span class="t9">{195}</span></a><span class="t30"> And when he had preached the Dhamma to them in these and other ways, he said: &ldquo;In forsaking such a refuge as this, you have gone astray.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a787"></a><span class="t30">And here the gift of the several paths to those who meditate on the thought of the Buddha and so forth, should be made clear by such discourses as the following, &ldquo;One thing there is, monks, which, if practised and developed, conduces to utter loathing of the world&rsquo;s vanities, to the cessation of passion, to the end of being, to peace, to deep knowledge, to Awakening, to Nibbāna. What is this one thing? The meditation on the thought of the Buddha.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a788"></a><a id="a789"></a><a id="a790"></a><span class="t30">When he had thus exhorted the disciples, the Fortunate One said: &ldquo;So too in times past, disciples, the men who jumped to the fatuous conclusion that what was no refuge was a real refuge, fell a prey to Amanussas in a Yakkha-haunted wilderness and were utterly destroyed; while the men who clave to the absolute and indisputable truth, prospered in the self-same wilderness.&rdquo; And when he had said this, he became silent.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a791"></a><span class="t30">Then, rising up from his seat and saluting the Fortunate One, the layman Anāthapiṇḍika burst into praises, and with clasped hands raised in reverence to his forehead, spoke thus, &ldquo;It is clear to us, sir, that in these present days these disciples were led by error into forsaking the supreme refuge. But the bygone destruction of those opinionated ones in the wilderness haunted by Amanussas, and the prospering of the men who clave to the truth, are hidden from us and known only to you. </span><span class="t18">{1.98}</span><a id="a792"></a><span class="t30"> May it please the Fortunate One, as though causing the full moon to rise in the sky, to make this thing clear to us.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> [1.4]</span><a id="a793"></a><span class="t30"> Then said the Fortunate One, &ldquo;It was solely to brush away the world&rsquo;s difficulties that by the display of the Ten Perfections</span><a id="a794"></a><a href="notes.html#a14617"><span class="t9">{196}</span></a><span class="t30"> through myriad aeons I won omniscience. Give ear and hearken, as closely as if you were filling a tube of gold with lion&rsquo;s marrow.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Having thus excited the Treasurer&rsquo;s attention, he uncovered what rebirth had concealed from them, as though, after cleaving the storehouse of the snows, he were driving the full moon through the space between the worlds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a795"></a>In the past in the city of Benares in the Kāsi country there was a king named Brahmadatta. In those days the Bodhisatta was born into a merchant&rsquo;s family, and growing up in due course, used to journey about trading with five hundred carts, travelling now from east to west and now from west to east. There was also at Benares another young merchant, a stupid blockhead, lacking skill in means.</p>
<p class="p7">Now at the time of our story the Bodhisatta had loaded five hundred carts with costly wares of Benares and had got them all ready to start. And so had the foolish young merchant too. Thought the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;If this foolish young merchant keeps me company all along, and the thousand carts travel along together, it will be too much for the road; it will be a hard matter to get wood, water, and so forth for the men, or grass for the oxen. Either he or I must go on first.&rdquo; So he sent for the other and laid his view before him, saying: &ldquo;The two of us can&rsquo;t travel together; would you rather go first or last?&rdquo; Thought the other, &ldquo;There will be many advantages if I go on first. I shall have a road which is not yet cut up; my oxen will have the pick of the grass; my men will have the pick of the herbs for curry; the water will be undisturbed; and, lastly, I shall fix my own price for the barter of my goods.&rdquo; Accordingly he replied, &ldquo;I will go first, my dear sir.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{1.99}</span></p>
<p class="p7">The Bodhisatta, on the other hand, saw many advantages in going last, for he argued thus to himself, &ldquo;Those who go first will level the road where it is rough, while I shall travel along the road they have already travelled; their oxen will have grazed off the coarse old grass, while mine will pasture on the sweet young growth which will spring up in its place; my men will find a fresh growth of sweet herbs for curry where the old ones have been picked; where there is no water, the first caravan will have to dig to supply themselves, and we shall drink at the wells they dug. Haggling over prices is hard work; whereas I, following later, shall barter my wares at the prices they have already fixed.&rdquo; Accordingly, seeing all these advantages, he said to the other, &ldquo;Then go you first, my dear sir.&rdquo;<a id="a796"></a><span class="t18"> [1.5]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Very well, I will,&rdquo; said the foolish merchant. And he yoked his carts and set out. Journeying along, he left human habitations behind him and came to the outskirts of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a797"></a>Now wildernesses are of the five following kinds: robber wildernesses, wild-beast wildernesses, drought wildernesses, Amanussa wildernesses, and famine wildernesses. The first is when the way is beset by robbers; the second is when the way is beset by lions and other wild beasts; the third is when there is no bathing or water to be got; the fourth is when the road is beset by Amanussas; and the fifth is when no roots or other food are to be found. And in this fivefold category the wilderness in question was both a drought, and a Amanussa wilderness.</p>
<p class="p7">Accordingly this young merchant took great big water-jars on his carts, and filling them with water, set out to cross the sixty leagues of desert which lay before him. Now when he had reached the middle of the wilderness, the Yakkha who haunted it said to himself, &ldquo;I will make these men throw away their stock of water, and devour them all when they are faint.&rdquo; So he <span class="t18">{1.100}</span> framed by his magic power a delightful carriage drawn by pure white young bulls. With a retinue of some ten or twelve Amanussas bearing bows and quivers, swords and shields, he rode along to meet them like a mighty lord in this carriage, with blue lotuses and white water-lilies wreathed round his head, with wet hair and wet clothes, and with muddy carriage-wheels. His attendants, too, in front and rear of him went along with their hair and clothes wet, with garlands of blue lotuses and white water-lilies on their heads, and with bunches of white lotuses in their hands, chewing the esculent stalks, and dripping with water and mire.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the leaders of caravans have the following custom: whenever the wind blows in their teeth, they ride on in front in their carriage with their attendants round them, in order to escape the dust; but when the wind blows from behind them, then they ride in like fashion in the rear of the column. And, as on this occasion the wind was blowing against them, the young merchant was riding in front.</p>
<p class="p7">When the Yakkha became aware of the merchant&rsquo;s approach, he drew his carriage aside from the track and greeted him kindly, asking him whither he was going. The leader of the caravan too caused his carriage to be drawn aside from the track so as to let the carts pass by, while he stayed by the way and thus addressed the Yakkha, &ldquo;We are just on our way from Benares, sir. But I observe that you have lotuses and water-lilies on your heads and in your hands, and that your people are chewing the esculent stalks, and that you are all muddy and dripping with wet. Pray did it rain while you were on the road, and did you come on pools covered with lotuses and water-lilies?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Hereon the Yakkha exclaimed, &ldquo;What did you say? Why, yonder appears the dark-green streak of the forest, and thence onward there is nothing but water all through the forest. It is always raining there; the <a id="a798"></a><span class="t18">[1.6]</span> pools are full; and on every side are lakes covered with lotuses and water-lilies.&rdquo; Then as the line of carts <span class="t18">{1.101}</span> passed by, he asked where they were bound for. &ldquo;To such and such a place,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;And what wares have you got in this cart and in this?&rdquo; &ldquo;So and so.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what might you have in this last cart which seems to move as if it were heavily laden?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s water in that.&rdquo; &ldquo;You did well to carry water with you from the other side. But there is no need for it now, as water is abundant on ahead. So break the jars and throw the water away, that you may travel easier.&rdquo; And he added, &ldquo;Now continue on your way, as we have stopped too long already.&rdquo; Then he went a little way further on, till he was out of sight, when he made his way back to the Yakkha-city where he dwelt.</p>
<p class="p7">Such was the folly of that foolish merchant that he did the Yakkha&rsquo;s bidding, and had his jars broken and the water all thrown away &ndash; without saving so much even as would go in the palm of a man&rsquo;s hand. Then he ordered the carts to drive on. Not a drop of water did they find on ahead, and thirst exhausted the men. All day long till the sun went down they kept on the march; but at sunset they unyoked their carts and made a coral, tethering the oxen to the wheels. The oxen had no water to drink, and the men none to cook their rice with; and the tired-out band sank to the ground to slumber. But as soon as night fell, the Yakkhas came out from their city, and slew every single one of those men and oxen; and when they had devoured their flesh, leaving only the bare bones, the Yakkhas departed. Thus was the foolish young merchant the sole cause of the destruction of that whole band, whose skeletons were strewn in every conceivable direction, while the five hundred carts stood there with their loads untouched.</p>
<p class="p7">Now the Bodhisatta allowed some six weeks to pass by after the starting of the foolish young merchant, before he set out. Then he proceeded from the city with his five hundred carts, and in due course came to the outskirts of the wilderness. Here he had his water-jars filled and laid in an ample stock of water; and by beat of drum he had his men assembled in camp, <span class="t18">{1.102}</span> and thus addressed them, &ldquo;Let not so much as a palmful of water be used without my sanction. There are poison trees in this wilderness; so let no man among you eat any leaf, flower, or fruit which he has not eaten before, without first asking me.&rdquo; With this exhortation to his men, he pushed on into the wilderness with his 500 carts.</p>
<p class="p7">When he had reached the middle of the wilderness, the Yakkha made his appearance on the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s path as in the former case. But, as soon as he became aware of the Yakkha, the Bodhisatta saw through him; for he thought to himself, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no water here, in this &lsquo;Waterless Desert.&rsquo; This person with his red eyes and aggressive bearing, casts no shadow. Very likely he has induced the foolish young merchant who <a id="a799"></a><span class="t18">[1.7]</span> preceded me, to throw away all his water, and then, waiting till they were worn out, has eaten up the merchant with all his men. But he doesn&rsquo;t know my cleverness and ready wit.&rdquo; Then he shouted to the Yakkha, &ldquo;Begone! We&rsquo;re men of business, and do not throw away what water we have got, before we see where more is to come from. But, when we do see more, we may be trusted to throw this water away and lighten our carts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a800"></a>The Yakkha rode on a bit further till he was out of sight, and then betook himself back to his home in the Yakkha city. But when the Yakkha had gone, the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s men said to him, &ldquo;Sir, we heard from those men that yonder is the dark-green streak of the forest appearing, where they said it was always raining. They had lotuses on their heads and water-lilies in their hands and were eating the stalks, while their clothes and hair were wringing wet, with water streaming off them. Let us throw away our water and get on a bit quicker with lightened carts.&rdquo; On hearing these words, the Bodhisatta ordered a halt and had the men gather to him. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;did any man among you ever hear before today that there was a lake or a pool in this wilderness?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;why it&rsquo;s known as &lsquo;the Waterless Desert.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;We have just been told by some people that it is raining just on ahead, in the belt of forest; now how far does a rain-wind carry?&rdquo; <span class="t18">{1.103}</span> &ldquo;A league, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;And has this rain-wind reached any one man here?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;How far off can you see the crest of a storm-cloud?&rdquo; &ldquo;A league, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;And has any one man here seen the top of even a single storm-cloud?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;How far off can you see a flash of lightning?&rdquo; &ldquo;Four or five leagues, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;And has any one man here seen a flash of lightning?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; How far off can a man hear a peal of thunder?&rdquo; &ldquo;Two or three leagues, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;And has any man here heard a peal of thunder?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;These are not men but Yakkhas. They will return in the hope of devouring us when we are weak and faint after throwing away our water at their bidding. As the young merchant who went on before us was not a man having skill in means, most likely he has been fooled into throwing his water away and has been devoured when exhaustion ensued. We may expect to find his five hundred carts standing just as they were loaded for the start; we shall come on them today. Press on with all possible speed, without throwing away a drop of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Urging his men forward with these words, he proceeded on his way till he came upon the 500 carts standing just as they had been loaded and the skeletons of the men and oxen lying strewn in every direction. He had his carts unyoked and ranged in a circle so as to form a strong coral; he saw that his men and oxen had their supper early, and that the oxen were made to lie down in the middle with the men round them; and he himself with the leading men of his band stood on guard, sword in hand, through the three watches of the night, waiting for the day to dawn. On the <a id="a801"></a><span class="t18">[1.8]</span> morrow at daybreak when he had had his oxen fed and everything needful done, he discarded his own weak carts for stronger ones, and his own common goods for the most costly of the derelict goods. Then he went on to his destination, where he bartered his stock for wares of twice or three times their value, and came back to his own city without losing a single man out of all his company.<span class="t18"> {1.104}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">This story ended, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Thus it was, layman, that in times past the fatuous came to utter destruction, while those who clave to the truth, escaping from the Amanussas&rsquo; hands, reached their goal in safety and came back to their homes again.&rdquo; And when he had thus linked the two stories together, he, as the Buddha, spoke the following verse for the purposes of this lesson on the Dhamma:</span></p>

<p class="p23"><span class="t30">Thus did the Fortunate One teach this lesson respecting Dhamma.

<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Having delivered his lesson and his teaching, and having told the two stories and established the connection linking them together, the Teacher concluded by identifying the Jātaka as follows, &ldquo;Devadatta was the foolish young merchant of those days; his followers were the followers of that merchant; the followers of the Buddha were the followers of the wise merchant, who was myself.&rdquo;</span><a id="a830"></a><span class="t18"> [1.9]</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Untiring.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> This discourse was delivered by the Fortunate One while he was dwelling at Sāvatthi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">About whom, you ask? About a monk who gave up persevering.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a844"></a><span class="t30">Tradition says that, while the Tathāgata was dwelling at Sāvatthi, there came to Jetavana a scion of a Sāvatthi family, who, on hearing a discourse by the Teacher, realised that sensual desires breed suffering, and was admitted to the first stage of the Saṅgha, then the higher ordination, and after five years,</span><a id="a845"></a><a href="notes.html#a14624"><span class="t9">{199}</span></a><span class="t30"> when he had learned two summaries and had trained himself in the methods of Insight, he obtained from the Teacher a theme for meditation which commended itself to him. Retiring to a forest, he passed there the rainy season; but for all his striving during the three months, he could not develop a glimmer or an inkling of Insight. So the thought came to him, &ldquo;The Teacher said there were four types of men, and I must belong to the lowest of all; in this birth, I think, there is neither Path nor Fruit for me. What good shall I do by living in the forest? I will go back to the Teacher, and live my life beholding the glories of the Buddha&rsquo;s presence and listening to his sweet teachings.&rdquo; And back again to Jetavana he came.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now his friends and intimates said: &ldquo;Sir, it was you who obtained from the Teacher a theme for meditation and departed to live the solitary life of a sage. Yet here you are back again, going about enjoying fellowship. Can it be that you have won the crown of the monks&rsquo; vocation and that you will never know rebirth?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sirs, as I won neither Path nor Fruit, I felt myself doomed to futility, and so gave up persevering and came back.&rdquo; &ldquo;You have done wrong, sir, in showing a faint heart when you had devoted yourself to the Dhamma of the dauntless Teacher. </span><span class="t18">{1.107}</span><span class="t30"> Come, let us bring you to the Tathāgata&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo; And they took him with them to the Teacher.</span><a id="a846"></a><span class="t18"> [1.10]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Teacher became aware of their coming, he said: &ldquo;Monks, you bring with you this monk against his will. What has he done?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, after devoting himself to so absolutely true a Dhamma, this monk has given up persevering in the solitary life of a sage, and has come back.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then said the Teacher to him, &ldquo;Is it true, as they say, that you, monk, have given up persevering?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is true, Fortunate One.&rdquo; &ldquo;But how comes it that, after devoting yourself to such a Dhamma, you, monk, should be the one to show yourself not a man desiring little, contented, solitary, and determined, but a man lacking perseverance? Was it not you who were so stout-hearted in bygone days? Was it not by you single-handed, thanks to your perseverance, that in a sandy desert the men and the oxen belonging to a caravan of five hundred carts got water and were cheered? And how is it that, now, you are giving in?&rdquo; These words sufficed to give heart to that monk.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Hearing this talk, the monks asked the Fortunate One, saying: &ldquo;Sir, the present faintheartedness of this monk is clear to us; but hidden from us is the knowledge of how, by the perseverance of this single man, the men and oxen got water in a sandy desert and were cheered. This is known only to you who are omniscient; pray tell us about it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Hearken, then, monks,&rdquo; said the Fortunate One; and, having excited their attention, he made clear the thing that rebirth had concealed from them.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past when Brahmadatta was king of Benares in Kāsi the Bodhisatta was born into a trader&rsquo;s family. When he was grown up, he used to travel about trading with 500 carts. On one occasion he came to a sandy wilderness sixty leagues across, the sand of which was so fine that, when grasped, it slipped through the fingers of the closed fist. As soon as the sun got up, it grew as hot as a bed of charcoal-embers and nobody could walk upon it. Accordingly, those traversing it used to take firewood, water, oil, rice and so forth on their carts, and only travelled by night. At dawn they used to range their carts in a circle to form a coral, with an awning spread overhead, and after an early meal used to sit in the shade all the day long. When the sun went down, they had their evening meal; and, so soon as the ground became cool, they used to yoke their carts and move forward. Travelling on this desert was like voyaging over the sea; a &lsquo;desert-pilot,&rsquo; as he was called, had to convoy them over by knowledge of the stars. <span class="t18">{1.108}</span> And this was the way in which our merchant was now travelling that wilderness.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a847"></a>When he had only some seven more miles before him, he thought to himself, &ldquo;Tonight will see us out of this sandy wilderness.&rdquo; So, after they had had their supper, he ordered the wood and water to be thrown away, and yoking his carts, set out on the road. In the front cart sat the pilot upon a couch looking up to the stars in the heavens and directing the course thereby. But so long had he been without sleep that he was tired out and fell asleep, with the result that he did not mark that the oxen had turned round and were retracing their steps. All night the oxen kept on their way, but at dawn the pilot woke up, and, observing the disposition of the stars overhead, shouted out, &ldquo;Turn the carts round! <a id="a848"></a><span class="t18">[1.11]</span> Turn the carts round!&rdquo; And as they turned the carts round and were forming them into line, the day broke. &ldquo;Why this is where we camped yesterday,&rdquo; cried the people of the caravan. &ldquo;All our wood and water is gone, and we are lost.&rdquo; So saying, they unyoked their carts and made a coral and spread the awning overhead; then each man flung himself down in despair beneath his own cart.</p>
<p class="p7">Thought the Bodhisatta to himself, &ldquo;If I give in, every single one will perish.&rdquo; So he ranged to and fro while it was still early and cool, until he came on a clump of kusa grass. &ldquo;This grass,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;can only have grown up here thanks to the presence of water underneath.&rdquo; So he ordered a spade to be brought and a hole to be dug at that spot. Sixty cubits down they dug, till at that depth the spade struck on a rock, and everybody lost heart. But the Bodhisatta, feeling sure there must be water under that rock, descended into the hole and took his stand upon the rock. Stooping down, he applied his ear to it, and listened. Catching the sound of water flowing beneath, he came out and said to a serving lad, &ldquo;My boy, if you give in, we shall all perish. So take heart and courage. Go down into the hole with this iron sledge-hammer, and strike the rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Obedient to his master&rsquo;s bidding, <span class="t18">{1.109}</span> the lad, resolute where all others had lost heart, went down and struck the rock. The rock which had dammed the stream, split asunder and fell in. Up rose the water in the hole till it was as high as a palm tree; and everybody drank and bathed. Then they chopped up their spare axles and yokes and other surplus gear, cooked their rice and ate it, and fed their oxen. And as soon as the sun set, they hoisted a flag by the side of the well and travelled on to their destination. There they bartered away their goods for twice and four times their value. With the proceeds they returned to their own home, where they lived out their term of life and in the end passed away to fare thereafter according to their deeds. The Bodhisatta too after a life spent in generosity and other good works, passed away likewise to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a849"></a><span class="t30">When the Supreme Buddha had delivered this discourse, he, after Fully Awakening, uttered this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><a id="a850"></a><a id="a851"></a><a id="a852"></a><a id="a853"></a><span class="t12">1. Akilāsuno, vaṇṇupathe khaṇantā,</span></p>

<p class="p23"><span class="t30">This discourse ended, he preached the Four Truths, at the close whereof the fainthearted monk was established in the highest fruit of all, which is Arahatship. Having told these two stories, the Teacher established the connection linking them both together, and identified the Jātaka by saying: &ldquo;This fainthearted monk of today was in those days the serving lad who, persevering, broke the rock and gave water to all the people; the Buddha&rsquo;s followers were the rest of the people of the caravan; and I myself was their leader.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present a monk is about to give up striving. The Buddha tells a story of two merchants, one of whom attempts to cheat a poor family out of its riches, while the other paid a decent price for their golden bowl.</span><a id="a882"></a><a href="notes.html#a14626"><span class="t16">{200}</span></a></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;If here you miss being certain.&rdquo;</span><span class="t30"> </span><span class="t18">[1.12]</span><span class="t30"> This lesson too was taught by the Fortunate One while at Sāvatthi, also about a monk who gave up persevering.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">For, when the man was brought by the monks exactly as in the foregoing case, the Teacher said: &ldquo;You, monk, who after devoting yourself to this glorious dispensation which bestows Path and Fruit, </span><span class="t18">{1.111}</span><span class="t30"> are giving up persevering, will suffer long, like the hawker of Seri who lost a golden bowl worth a hundred thousand pieces.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks asked the Fortunate One to explain this to them. The Fortunate One made clear this thing concealed from them by rebirth.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a884"></a><a id="a885"></a><a id="a886"></a>In the past in the kingdom of Seri, five aeons ago, the Bodhisatta dealt in pots and pans, and was called &lsquo;the Serivā.&rsquo; In the company of another dealer in the same wares, a greedy fellow who was also known as &lsquo;the Serivā,&rsquo; he came across the river Telavāha and entered the city of Andhapura. Apportioning the streets between the two of them, he set about hawking his wares round the streets of his district, and the other did the same in his district.</p>
<p class="p7">Now in that city there was a family who had fallen on hard times. Once they had been rich merchants, but by the time of our story they had lost all the sons and brothers and all their wealth. The sole survivors were a girl and her grandmother, and they got their living by working for hire. Nevertheless, they had got in their house a golden bowl out of which in the old days the great merchant, the head of the family, used to eat; but it had been thrown among the pots and pans, and having been long out of use, was grimed over with dirt, so that the two women did not know that it was gold. To the door of their house came the greedy hawker on his round, crying, &ldquo;Waterpots to sell! Waterpots to sell!&rdquo; And the damsel, when she knew he was there, said to her grandmother, &ldquo;Oh, do buy me a trinket, grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very poor, dear; what can we offer in exchange for it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why here&rsquo;s this bowl which is no good to us. Let us change that for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The old woman had the hawker brought in and seated, and gave him the bowl, saying: &ldquo;Take this, sir, and be so good as to give your sister something or other in exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">The hawker took the bowl in his hand, turned it over, and, suspecting it was gold, scratched a line on the back of it with a needle, whereby he <a id="a887"></a><span class="t18">[1.13]</span> knew for certain that it was real gold. Then, thinking that he would get the pot without giving anything whatsoever for it to the women, he cried, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the value of this, pray? Why it isn&rsquo;t worth half a farthing!&rdquo; <span class="t18">{1.112}</span> And therewithal he threw the bowl on the ground, rose up from his seat, and left the house.</p>
<p class="p7">Now, as it had been agreed between the two hawkers that the one might try the streets which the other had already been into, the Bodhisatta came into that same street and appeared at the door of the house, crying, &ldquo;Waterpots to sell!&rdquo; Once again the damsel made the same request of her grandmother; and the old woman, replied, &ldquo;My dear, the first hawker threw our bowl on the ground and stormed out of the house. What have we got left to offer now?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Oh, but that hawker was a harsh-spoken man, grandmother dear; while this one looks a nice man and speaks kindly. Very likely he would take it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Call him in then.&rdquo; So he came into the house, and they gave him a seat and put the bowl into his hands. Seeing that the bowl was gold, he said: &ldquo;Mother, this bowl is worth a hundred thousand pieces; I haven&rsquo;t its value with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Sir, the first hawker who came here said that it was not worth half a farthing; so he threw it to the ground and went away. It must have been the efficacy of your own goodness which has turned the bowl into gold. Take it; give us something or other for it; and go your way.&rdquo; At the time the Bodhisatta had 500 pieces of money and a stock worth as much more. The whole of this he gave to them, saying: &ldquo;Let me retain my scales, my bag, and eight pieces of money.&rdquo; And with their consent he took these with him, and departed with all speed to the riverside where he gave his eight coins to the boatman and jumped into the boat. Subsequently that greedy hawker had come back to the house, and had asked them to bring out their bowl, saying he would give them something or other for it. But the old woman flew out at him with these words, &ldquo;You made out that our golden bowl which is worth a hundred thousand pieces was not worth even a half-farthing. But there came an upright hawker &ndash; your master, I take it &ndash; who gave us a thousand pieces for it and took the bowl away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Hereupon he exclaimed, &ldquo;He has robbed me of a golden bowl worth a full hundred thousand pieces; he has caused me a terrible loss.&rdquo; And intense sorrow came upon him, so that he lost command over himself and became like one distraught. <span class="t18">{1.113}</span> His money and goods he flung away at the door of the house; he threw off his upper and under cloths; and, armed with the beam of his scales as a club, he tracked the Bodhisatta down to the riverside. Finding the latter already crossing, he shouted to the boatman to put back, but the Bodhisatta told him not to do so. As the other stood there gazing and gazing at the retreating Bodhisatta, intense sorrow seized upon him, his heart grew hot; blood gushed from his lips; <a id="a888"></a><span class="t18">[1.14]</span> and his heart cracked like the mud at the bottom of a tank, which the sun has dried up. Through the hatred which he had contracted against the Bodhisatta, he perished then and there &ndash; this was the first time Devadatta conceived a grudge against the Bodhisatta. The Bodhisatta, after a life spent in generosity and other good works, passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the Supreme Buddha had ended this lesson, he, after Fully Awakening, uttered this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Idha ce naṁ virādhesi Saddhammassa niyāmataṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ciraṁ tvaṁ anutappesi, Serivāyaṁ va vāṇijo ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">If here you miss being certain of results in the True Dhamma, for a long time you will suffer, like the merchant in Serivā.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="t30">After having thus delivered his discourse in such a way as to lead up to Arahatship, the Teacher expounded the Four Truths, at the close whereof the fainthearted monk was established in that highest fruit of all, which is Arahatship. And, after telling the two stories, the Teacher made the connection linking them both together, and identified the Jātaka by saying in conclusion, &ldquo;In those days Devadatta was the foolish hawker; and I myself was the wise and good hawker.&rdquo;</span></p>

And here an account of Cullapanthaka&rsquo;s birth must be given. Tradition tells us that the daughter of a rich merchant&rsquo;s family in Rājagaha actually stooped to intimacy with a slave. Becoming alarmed lest her misconduct should get known, she said to the slave, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t live on here; for if my mother and father come to know of this wrong of ours, they will tear us limb from limb. Let us go and live afar off.&rdquo; So with their belongings in their hands they stole together out by the hardly-opened door, and fled away, they cared not whither, to find a shelter beyond the ken of her family. Then they went and lived together in a certain place, with the result that she conceived. And when her full time was nearly come, she told her husband and said: &ldquo;If I am taken in labour away from kith and kin, that will be a trouble to both of us. So let us go home.&rdquo;</span><a id="a905"></a><a href="notes.html#a14632"><span class="t9">{203}</span></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">First he </span><a id="a906"></a><span class="t18">[1.15]</span><span class="t30"> agreed to start today, and then he put it off till the morrow; and so he let the days slip by, till she thought to herself, &ldquo;This fool is so conscious of his great offence that he dares not go. One&rsquo;s parents are one&rsquo;s best friends; so whether he goes or stays, I must go.&rdquo; So, when he went out, she put all her household matters in order and set off home, telling her next-door neighbour where she was going. Returning home, and not finding his wife, but discovering from the neighbours that she had started off from home, he hurried after her and came up with her on the road; and then and there she was taken in labour.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, my dear?&rdquo; said he.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;I have given birth to a son, my husband,&rdquo; said she.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Accordingly, as the very thing had now happened which was the only reason for the journey, they both agreed that it was no good going on now, and so turned back again.

<p class="p7"><a id="a907"></a><span class="t30">Not long after, she was with child again, and everything fell out as before.

Then, with both their children, they again went back to their own home.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now, as they were living there, their way-child heard other boys talking of their uncles and grandfathers and grandmothers; so he asked his mother whether he hadn&rsquo;t got relations like the other boys. &ldquo;Oh yes, my dear,&rdquo; said his mother, &ldquo;but they don&rsquo;t live here. Your grandfather is a wealthy merchant in the city of Rājagaha, and you have plenty of relations there.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go there, mother?&rdquo; She told the boy the reason why they stayed away; but, as the children kept on speaking about these relations, she said to her husband, &ldquo;The children are always plaguing me. Are my parents going to eat us at sight? Come, let us show the children their grandfather&rsquo;s family.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind taking them there; but I really could not face your parents.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right, so long as, some way or other, the children come to see their grandfather&rsquo;s family,&rdquo; said she.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">So those two took their children and coming in due course to Rājagaha put up in a public rest-house by the city gate. Then, taking with them the two children, the woman caused their coming to be made known to her parents. The latter, on hearing the message, returned this answer, &ldquo;True, it is strange to be without children unless one has renounced the world in quest of Arahatship. Still, so great is the guilt of the pair towards us that they may not stand in our sight. Here is a sum of money for them: let them take this and retire to live where they will. But the children they may send here.&rdquo; Then the merchant&rsquo;s daughter took the money so sent her, and dispatched the children by the messengers. So the children grew up in their grandfather&rsquo;s house &ndash; Cullapanthaka being of tender years, while Mahāpanthaka used to go with his grandfather to hear the One with Ten Powers preach the Dhamma. And by constant hearing of the Dhamma from the Teacher&rsquo;s own lips, the lad&rsquo;s heart yearned to renounce the world for the life of a monk.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;With your permission,&rdquo; said he to his grandfather, &ldquo;I should like to join the Saṅgha.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do I hear?&rdquo; cried the old man. &ldquo;Why, it would give me greater joy to see you join the Saṅgha than to see the whole world join. Become a monk, if you feel able.&rdquo; And he took him to the Teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Well, merchant,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;have you brought your boy with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes sir, this is my grandson, who wishes to join your Saṅgha.&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">{1.116}</span><a id="a908"></a><span class="t30"> Then the Teacher sent for a monk, and told him to admit the lad to the Saṅgha; and the monk repeated the Formula of the Perishable Body</span><a id="a909"></a><a href="notes.html#a14634"><span class="t9">{204}</span></a><span class="t30"> and </span><a id="a910"></a><span class="t18">[1.16]</span><span class="t30"> admitted the lad as a novice. When the latter had learned by heart many words of the Buddha, and was old enough, he was admitted as a full monk. He now gave himself up to earnest thought till he became an Arahat; and as he passed his days in the enjoyment of Absorption and the paths, he thought whether he could not impart the like happiness to Cullapanthaka. So he went to his grandfather the merchant, and said: &ldquo;Great merchant, with your consent, I will admit Cullapanthaka to the Saṅgha.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pray do so, venerable sir,&rdquo; was the reply.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then the elder admitted the lad Cullapanthaka and established him in the Ten Precepts. But Cullapanthaka proved a dullard: with four months&rsquo; study he failed to get by heart this single verse:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&ldquo;Lo! Like a fragrant lotus at the dawn</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Of day, full-blown, with virgin wealth of scent,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Behold the Buddha&rsquo;s glory shining forth,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">As in the vaulted heaven beams the sun!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">For, we are told, in the Buddhahood of Kassapa this Cullapanthaka, having himself attained to knowledge as a monk, laughed to scorn a dull monk who was learning a passage by heart. His scorn so confused the dull monk, that the latter could not learn or recite the passage. And now, in consequence, on joining the Saṅgha he himself proved a dullard. Each new line he learned drove the last out of his memory; and four months slipped away while he was struggling with this single verse. Said his elder brother to him, &ldquo;Panthaka, you are not equal to receiving this dispensation. In four whole months you have been unable to learn a single verse. How then can you hope to crown your vocation with supreme success? Leave the monastery.&rdquo; But, though thus expelled by his brother, Cullapanthaka was so attached to the Buddha&rsquo;s dispensation that he did not want to become a layman.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a911"></a><span class="t30">Now at that time Mahāpanthaka was acting as steward. And Jīvaka Komārabhacca, going to his mango-grove with a large present of perfumes and flowers for the Teacher, had presented his offering and listened to a discourse; then, rising from his seat and bowing to the One with Ten Powers, he went up to Mahāpanthaka and asked, &ldquo;How many monks are there, venerable sir, with the Teacher?&rdquo; &ldquo;Just 500, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Will you bring the 500 monks, with the Buddha at their head, to take their meal at my house tomorrow?&rdquo; &ldquo;Lay disciple, one of them named Cullapanthaka is a dullard and makes no progress in the Faith,&rdquo; said the elder, &ldquo;I accept the invitation for everyone but him.&rdquo;</span><span class="t18"> {1.117}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Hearing this, Cullapanthaka thought to himself, &ldquo;In accepting the invitation for all these monks, the elder carefully accepts so as to exclude me. This proves that my brother&rsquo;s affection for me is dead. What have I to do with this dispensation? I will become a layman and live in the exercise of generosity and other good works of a lay person.&rdquo; And on the morrow early he went forth, avowedly to become a layman again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now at the first break of day, as he was surveying the world, the Teacher became aware of this; and going forth even earlier than Cullapanthaka, he paced to and fro by the porch on Cullapanthaka&rsquo;s road. As the latter came out of the house, he observed the Teacher, and with a salutation went up to him. &ldquo;Whither away at this hour, Cullapanthaka?&rdquo; said the Teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;My brother has expelled me from the Saṅgha, sir; and I am going to wander forth.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Cullapanthaka, as it was under me that you took the vows, why did you not, when expelled by your brother, come to me? Come, what have you to do with a layman&rsquo;s life? You shall stay with me.&rdquo; So saying, he took Cullapanthaka and seated him at the door of his own perfumed chamber. Then giving him a perfectly clean cloth which he had made by his Supernormal Powers, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Face towards the east, and as you handle this cloth, repeat these words &ndash; &lsquo;Removal of Impurity; Removal of Impurity.&rsquo; &rdquo; Then at the time appointed the Teacher, attended by the Saṅgha, went to Jīvaka&rsquo;s house and sat down on the seat set for him.</span><a id="a912"></a><span class="t18"> [1.17]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a913"></a><span class="t30">Now Cullapanthaka, with his gaze fixed on the sun, sat handling the cloth and repeating the words, &ldquo;Removal of Impurity; Removal of Impurity.&rdquo; And as he kept handling the piece of cloth, it grew soiled. Then he thought: &ldquo;Just now this piece of cloth was quite clean; but I have destroyed its original state and made it dirty. Impermanent indeed are all compounded things! And even as he realised Death and Decay, he won the Arahat&rsquo;s Awakening. Knowing that Cullapanthaka&rsquo;s mind had won Awakening, the Teacher sent forth an apparition and in this semblance of himself appeared before him, as if seated in front of him and saying: &ldquo;Heed it not, Cullapanthaka, that this mere piece of cloth has become dirty and stained with impurity; within you are the impurities of lust and other evil things. Remove them.&rdquo; And the apparition uttered these verses:</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&ldquo;Impurity in lust consists, not dirt;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">And lust we term the real impurity.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Yea, monks, whoso drives it from his breast,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><a id="a914"></a><span class="t31">They live in the stainless dispensation. </span><span class="t18">{1.118}</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Impurity in wrath consists, not dirt;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">And wrath we term the real impurity.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Yea, monks, whoso drives it from his breast,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">They live in the stainless dispensation.</span></p>
<p class="p19"><span class="t22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Delusion is impurity, not dirt;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">We term delusion real impurity.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Yea, monks, whoso drives it from his breast,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">They live in the stainless dispensation.&rdquo;</span><a id="a915"></a><a href="notes.html#a14636"><span class="t32">{205}</span></a></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a916"></a><a id="a917"></a><span class="t30">At the close of these verses Cullapanthaka attained to Arahatship with the four analytic knowledges,</span><a id="a918"></a><a href="notes.html#a14640"><span class="t9">{206}</span></a><span class="t30"> whereby he straightaway came to have analytic knowledge of all the sacred texts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Tradition has it that, in ages past, when he was a king and was making a solemn procession round his city, he wiped the sweat from his brow with a spotless cloth which he was wearing; and the cloth was stained. He thought: &ldquo;It is this body of mine which has destroyed the original purity and whiteness of the cloth, and dirtied it. Impermanent indeed are all composite things.&rdquo; Thus he grasped the idea of impermanence; and hence it came to pass that it was the removal of impurity which worked his emancipation.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a919"></a><span class="t30">Meantime, Jīvaka Komārabhacca offered the Water of Donation;</span><a id="a920"></a><a href="notes.html#a14642"><span class="t9">{207}</span></a><span class="t30"> but the One with Ten Powers put his hand over the vessel, saying: &ldquo;Are there no monks, Jīvaka, in the monastery?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Said Mahāpanthaka, &ldquo;There are no monks there, venerable sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yes, there are, Jīvaka,&rdquo; said the Teacher. &ldquo;Hi, there!&rdquo; said Jīvaka to a servant, &ldquo;just you go and see whether or not there are any monks in the monastery.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At that moment Cullapanthaka, conscious as he was that his brother was declaring there were no monks in the monastery, determined to show him there were, and so filled the whole mango-grove with nothing but monks. Some were making robes, others dyeing, while others again were repeating the sacred texts: each of a thousand monks he made unlike all the others. Finding this host of monks in the monastery, the man returned and said that the whole mango-grove was full of monks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">But as regards the elder up in the monastery &ndash;</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">&ldquo;Panthaka, a thousand-fold self-multiplied,</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="t31">Sat on, till bidden, in that pleasant grove.&rdquo; </span><a id="a921"></a><span class="t18">[1.18]</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Now go back,&rdquo; said the Teacher to the man, &ldquo;and say &lsquo;The Teacher sends for him whose name is Cullapanthaka.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">But when the man went and delivered his message, a thousand mouths answered, &ldquo;I am Cullapanthaka! I am Cullapanthaka!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a922"></a><a id="a923"></a><span class="t30">Back came the man with the report, &ldquo;They all say they are &lsquo;Cullapanthaka,&rsquo; venerable sir.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Well now go back,&rdquo; said the Teacher, &ldquo;and take by the hand the first one of them who says he is Cullapanthaka, </span><span class="t18">{1.119}</span><span class="t30"> and the others will all vanish.&rdquo; The man did as he was bidden, and straightaway the thousand monks vanished from sight. The elder came back with the man.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">When the meal was over, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Jīvaka, take Cullapanthaka&rsquo;s bowl; he will return thanks.&rdquo; Jīvaka did so. Then like a young lion roaring defiance, the elder ranged over the whole of the sacred texts through in his address of thanks. Lastly, the Teacher rose from his seat and attended by the Saṅgha returned to the monastery, and there, after the assignment of tasks by the Saṅgha, he rose from his seat and, standing in the doorway of his perfumed chamber, delivered a Sugata&rsquo;s discourse to the Saṅgha. Ending with a theme which he gave out for meditation, and dismissing the Saṅgha, he retired into his perfumed chamber, and lay down lion-like on his right side to rest.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At evening, the orange-robed monks assembled together from all sides in the Dhamma Hall and sang the Teacher&rsquo;s praises, even as though they were spreading a curtain of orange cloth round him as they sat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; it was said: &ldquo;Mahāpanthaka failed to recognise the bent of Cullapanthaka, and expelled him from the monastery as a dullard who could not even learn a single verse in four whole months. But the All-Knowing Buddha by his supremacy in the Dhamma bestowed on him Arahatship with all its supernatural knowledge, even while a single meal was in progress. And by that knowledge he grasped the whole of the sacred texts. Oh! How great is a Buddha&rsquo;s power!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Now the Fortunate One, knowing full well the talk that was going on in the Dhamma Hall, thought it good to go there. So, rising from his Buddha-couch, he donned his two orange robes, girded himself as with lightning, arrayed himself in his upper robe, the ample robe of a Buddha, and came forth to the Dhamma Hall with the infinite grace of a Buddha, moving with the royal gait of an elephant in the plenitude of his vigour. Ascending the glorious Buddha-throne set in the midst of the resplendent hall, he seated himself upon the middle of the throne emitting those six-coloured rays which mark a Buddha &ndash; like the newly-arisen sun, when from the peaks of the Yugandhara Mountains he illumines the depths of the ocean. Immediately the Buddha came into the Hall, the Saṅgha broke off their talk and were silent. Gazing round on the company with gentle loving-kindness, the Teacher thought within himself, &ldquo;This company is perfect! Not a man is guilty of moving a hand or foot improperly; not a sound, not a cough or sneeze is to he heard! In their reverence and awe of the majesty and glory of the Buddha, not a man would dare to speak before I did, even if I sat here in silence all my life long. But it is my part to begin; and I will open the conversation.&rdquo; Then in his sweet divine tones he addressed the monks and said, </span><span class="t18">{1.120}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;What, pray, is theme of this conclave? And what was the talk which was broken off?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;it was no profitless theme, but your own praises that we were telling here in a meeting.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">And when they had told him word for word what they had been saying, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Monks, through me Cullapanthaka has just now risen to great things in the Dhamma; in times past it was to great things in the way of wealth that he rose &ndash; but equally through me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks asked the Teacher to explain this; and the Fortunate One made clear in these words a thing which succeeding existences had hidden from them: </span><a id="a924"></a><span class="t18">[1.19]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a925"></a>In the past when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares in Kāsi, the Bodhisatta was born into the Treasurer&rsquo;s family, and growing up, was made Treasurer, being called Cullakaseṭṭhi. A wise and clever man was he, with a keen eye for signs and omens. One day on his way to wait upon the king, he came on a dead mouse lying on the road; and, taking note of the position of the stars at that moment, he said: &ldquo;Any decent young fellow with his wits about him has only to pick that mouse up, and he might start a business and keep a wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">His words were overheard by a young man of good family but reduced circumstances, who said to himself, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a man who has always got a reason for what he says.&rdquo; And accordingly he picked up the mouse, which he sold for a farthing at a tavern to feed their cat.</p>
<p class="p7">With the farthing he got molasses and took drinking water in a waterpot. Coming on flower-gatherers returning from the forest, he gave each a tiny quantity of the molasses and ladled the water out to them. Each of them gave him a handful of flowers, with the proceeds of which, next day, he came back again to the flower grounds provided with more molasses and a pot of water. That day the flower-gatherers, before they went, gave him flowering plants with half the flowers left on them; and thus in a little while he obtained eight pennies.</p>
<p class="p7">Later, one rainy and windy day, the wind blew down a quantity of rotten branches and boughs and leaves in the king&rsquo;s pleasure gardens, and the gardener did not see how to clear them away. <span class="t18">{1.121}</span> Then up came the young man with an offer to remove the lot, if the wood and leaves might be his. The gardener closed with the offer on the spot. Then this apt pupil of Cullakaseṭṭhi repaired to the children&rsquo;s playground and in a very little while had got them by bribes of molasses to collect every stick and leaf in the place into a heap at the entrance to the pleasure gardens. Just then the king&rsquo;s potter was on the look out for fuel to fire bowls for the palace, and coming on this heap, took the lot off his hands. The sale of his wood brought in sixteen pennies to this pupil of Cullakaseṭṭhi, as well as five bowls and other vessels.</p>
<p class="p7">Having now twenty-four pennies in all, a plan occurred to him. He went to the vicinity of the city-gate with a jar full of water and supplied 500 mowers with water to drink. They said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done us a good turn, friend. What can we do for you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you when I want your aid,&rdquo; said he; and as he went about, he struck up an intimacy with a land-trader and a sea-trader. Said the former to him, &ldquo;Tomorrow there will come to town a horse-dealer with 500 horses to sell.&rdquo; On hearing this piece of news, he said to the mowers, &ldquo;I want each of you today to give me a bundle of grass and not to sell your own grass till mine is sold.&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; they said, and delivered the 500 bundles of grass at his house. Unable to get grass for his horses elsewhere, the dealer purchased our friend&rsquo;s grass for a thousand pieces. <a id="a926"></a><span class="t18">[1.20]</span></p>
<p class="p7">Only a few days later his sea-trading friend brought him news of the arrival of a large ship in port; and another plan struck him. He hired for eight pence a well appointed carriage which plied for hire by the hour, and went in great style down to the port. Having bought the ship on credit and deposited his signet-ring as security, he had a pavilion pitched nearby and said to his people as he took his seat inside, &ldquo;When merchants are being shown in, let them be passed on by three successive ushers into my presence.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{1.122}</span> Hearing that a ship had arrived in port, about a hundred merchants came down to buy the cargo; only to be told that they could not have it as a great merchant had already made a payment on account. So away they all went to the young man; and the footmen duly announced them by three successive ushers, as had been arranged beforehand. Each man of the hundred severally gave him a thousand pieces to buy a share in the ship and then a further thousand each to buy him out altogether. So it was with 200,000 pieces that this pupil of Cullakaseṭṭhi returned to Benares.</p>
<p class="p7">Actuated by a desire to show his gratitude, he went with one hundred thousand pieces to call on Cullakaseṭṭhi. &ldquo;How did you come by all this wealth?&rdquo; asked the Treasurer. &ldquo;In four short months, simply by following your advice,&rdquo; replied the young man; and he told him the whole story, starting with the dead mouse.</p>
<p class="p7">Thought the Lord High Treasurer Cullakaseṭṭhi, on hearing all this, &ldquo;I must see that a young fellow of these parts does not fall into anybody else&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo; So he married him to his own grown-up daughter and settled all the family estates on the young man. And at the Treasurer&rsquo;s death, he became Treasurer in that city. And the Bodhisatta passed away to fare according to his deeds. <span class="t18">{1.123}</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Supreme Buddha, after Fully Awakening, repeated this verse:</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Appakena pi medhāvī pābhatena vicakkhaṇo,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Samuṭṭhāpeti attānaṁ, aṇuṁ aggiṁ va sandhaman-ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">Even with little, an intelligent, skilled person, by a present, raises himself up, like a small fire that has been fanned is raised up.</span></p>
<p class="p23"><a id="a927"></a><span class="t30">Also the Fortunate One said: &ldquo;It is through me, monks, that Cullapanthaka has just now risen to great things in the Faith, as in times past to great things in the way of wealth.&rdquo; His lesson thus finished, the Teacher made the connection between the two stories he had told and identified the Jātaka in these concluding words, &ldquo;Cullapanthaka was in those days the pupil of Cullakaseṭṭhi, and I myself the Lord High Treasurer.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><a id="a932"></a><span class="t15">Alternative Title: Taṇḍulanāḷijātaka (Cst)</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t15">In the present a foolish monk manages to become steward for the Saṅgha, but doesn&rsquo;t understand how to properly value the distribution. The Buddha shows how he was also a fool in the past by telling the story of a valuer who was easily bribed into giving wrong prices.</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">The Bodhisatta = the wise valuer (paṇḍita-agghāpanika),</span></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="t15">Lāludāyī = the foolish village valuer (gāmikabāla-agghāpanika).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><a id="a933"></a><span class="t15">Keywords: Honesty, Truth.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;What value does a measure of rice have?&rdquo; </span><span class="t18">[1.21]</span><a id="a934"></a><span class="t30"> This was told by the Teacher, while at Jetavana, about the elder Udāyi, called the Dullard.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a935"></a><span class="t30">At that time the venerable Dabba, the Mallian, was steward to the Saṅgha.</span><a id="a936"></a><a href="notes.html#a14644"><span class="t9">{208}</span></a><a id="a937"></a><span class="t30"> When in the early morning Dabba was allotting the checks for rice, sometimes it was choice rice and sometimes it was an inferior quality which fell to the share of the elder Udāyi. On days when he received the inferior quality, he used to make a commotion in the check-room, by demanding, &ldquo;Is Dabba the only one who knows how to give out checks? Don&rsquo;t we know?&rdquo; One day when he was making a commotion, they handed him the check-basket, saying: &ldquo;Here! You give the checks out yourself today!&rdquo; Thenceforth, it was Udāyi who gave out the checks to the Saṅgha. But, in his distribution, he could not tell the best from the inferior rice; nor did he know what seniority</span><a id="a938"></a><a href="notes.html#a14647"><span class="t9">{209}</span></a><span class="t30"> was entitled to the best rice and what to the inferior. So too, when he was making out the roster, he had not an idea of the seniority of the monks thereon. Consequently, when the monks took up their places, he made a mark on the ground or on the wall to show that one detachment stood here, and another there. Next day there were fewer monks of one grade and more of another in the check-room; where there were fewer, the mark was too low down; where the number was greater, it was too high up. But Udāyi, quite ignorant of detachments, gave out the checks simply according to his old marks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Hence, the monks said to him, &ldquo;Friend Udāyi, the mark is too high up or too low down; the best rice is for those of such and such a seniority, and the inferior quality for such and such others.&rdquo; But he put them back with the argument, &ldquo;If this mark is where it is, what are you standing here for? Why am I to trust you? It&rsquo;s my mark I trust.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Then, the boys and novices </span><span class="t18">{1.124}</span><span class="t30"> thrust him from the check-room, crying, &ldquo;Friend Udāyi the Dullard, when you give out the checks, the monks are docked of what they ought to get; you&rsquo;re not fit to give them out; get you gone from here.&rdquo; Hereupon, a great uproar arose in the check-room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Hearing the noise, the Teacher asked the elder Ānanda, saying: &ldquo;Ānanda, there is a great uproar in the check-room. What is the noise about?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The elder explained it all to the Tathāgata. &ldquo;Ānanda,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is not the only time when Udāyi by his stupidity has robbed others of their profit; he did just the same thing in bygone times too.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The elder asked the Fortunate One for an explanation, and the Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed by rebirth.</span></p>
<p class="p7">In the past Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares in Kāsi. In those days our Bodhisatta was his valuer. He used to value horses, elephants, and the like; and jewels, gold, and the like; and he used to pay over to the owners of the goods the proper price, as he fixed it.<a id="a939"></a><span class="t18"> [1.22]</span></p>
<p class="p7">But the king was greedy and his greed suggested to him this thought: &ldquo;This valuer with his style of valuing will soon exhaust all the riches in my house; I must get another valuer.&rdquo; Opening his window and looking out into his courtyard, he espied walking across a stupid, greedy person in whom he saw a likely candidate for the post. So the king had the man sent for, and asked him whether he could do the work. &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said the man; and so, to safeguard the royal treasure, this stupid fellow was appointed valuer. After this the fool, in valuing elephants and horses and the like, used to fix a price dictated by his own fancy, neglecting their true worth; but, as he was valuer, the price was what he said and no other.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a940"></a>At that time there arrived from the north country<a id="a941"></a><a href="notes.html#a14649"><span class="t9">{210}</span></a> a horse-dealer with 500 horses. The king sent for his new valuer and bade him value the horses. And the price he set on the whole 500 horses was just one measure of rice, which he ordered to be paid over to the dealer, directing the horses to be led off to the stable. <a id="a942"></a><span class="t18">{1.125}</span> Away went the horse-dealer to the old valuer, to whom he told what had happened, and asked what was to be done. &ldquo;Give him a bribe,&rdquo; said the ex-valuer, &ldquo;and put this point to him: &lsquo;Knowing as we do that our horses are worth just a single measure of rice, we are curious to learn from you what the precise value of a measure of rice is; could you state its value in the king&rsquo;s presence?&rsquo; If he says he can, then take him before the king; and I too will be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Readily following the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s advice, the horse-dealer bribed the man and put the question to him. The other, having expressed his ability to value a measure of rice, was promptly taken to the palace, whither also went the Bodhisatta and many other ministers. With due obeisance the horse-dealer said: &ldquo;Sire, I do not dispute it that the price of 500 horses is a single measure of rice; but I would ask your majesty to question your valuer as to the value of that measure of rice.&rdquo; Ignorant of what had passed, the king said to the fellow, &ldquo;Valuer, what are 500 horses worth?&rdquo; &ldquo;A measure of rice, sire,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Very good, my friend; if 500 horses then are worth one measure of rice, what is that measure of rice worth?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is worth all Benares and its suburbs,&rdquo; was the fool&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p class="p7">(Thus we learn that, having first valued the horses at a measure of hill-paddy to please the king, he was bribed by the horse-dealer to estimate that measure of rice at the worth of all Benares and its suburbs. And that though the walls of Benares were twelve leagues round by themselves, while the city and suburbs together were three hundred leagues round! <a id="a943"></a><span class="t18">[1.23]</span> Yet the fool priced all this vast city and its suburbs at a single measure of rice!) <span class="t18">{1.126}</span></p>
<p class="p7">Hereupon the ministers clapped their hands and laughed merrily. &ldquo;We used to think,&rdquo; they said in scorn, &ldquo;that the earth and the realm were beyond price; but now we learn that the kingdom of Benares together with its king is only worth a single measure of rice! What talents the valuer has! How has he retained his post so long? But truly the valuer suits our king admirably.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a944"></a>Then the Bodhisatta repeated this verse:<a id="a945"></a><a href="notes.html#a14652"><span class="t9">{211}</span></a></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Kim-agghati taṇḍulanāḷikāyaṁ?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Assāna&rsquo; mūlāya vadehi, rāja?</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Bārāṇasiṁ santarabāhiraṁ,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Ayam-agghati taṇḍulanāḷikā ti!</span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="t4">What value does a measure of rice have? Do you speak of the price of horses, king? Benares, on the inside and outside, he values it at a measure of rice!</span></p>
<p class="p23">Thus put to open shame, the king sent the fool packing, and gave the Bodhisatta the office again. And when his life closed, the Bodhisatta passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended and the two stories told, the Teacher made the connection linking both together, and identified the Jātaka by saying in conclusion, &ldquo;Udāyi the Dullard was the stupid rustic valuer of those days, and I myself the wise valuer.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="t33">&ldquo;Endowed with conscience and concern.&rdquo;</span><a id="a957"></a><a id="a958"></a><span class="t30"> This story was told by the Fortunate One while at Jetavana, about a wealthy monk.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a959"></a><a id="a960"></a><span class="t30">Tradition tells us that, on the death of his wife, a householder of Sāvatthi joined the Saṅgha. When he was joining, he caused to be built for himself a chamber to live in, a room for the fire, and a store-room; and not till he had stocked his store-room with ghee, rice, and the like, did he finally join. Even after he had become a monk, he used to send for his servants and make them cook him what he liked to eat. He was richly provided with the requisites,</span><a id="a961"></a><a href="notes.html#a14655"><span class="t9">{212}</span></a><span class="t30"> having an entire change of clothing for night and another for day; and he dwelt aloof on the outskirts of the monastery.</span><a id="a962"></a><span class="t18"> [1.24]</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a963"></a><span class="t30">One day when he had taken out his cloths and bedding and had spread them out to dry in his chamber, a number of monks from the country, who were on a pilgrimage from monastery to monastery,</span><a id="a964"></a><a href="notes.html#a14657"><span class="t9">{213}</span></a><span class="t30"> came in their journeying to his cell and found all these belongings.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a965"></a><span class="t30">&ldquo;Whose are these?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;Mine, sirs,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;What, sir?&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;this upper-cloth and that as well; this under-robe as well as that; and that bedding too, is it all yours?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, nobody&rsquo;s but mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;the Fortunate One has only sanctioned three cloths; and yet, though the Buddha, to whose dispensation you have devoted yourself, is so simple in his wants, you forsooth have amassed all this stock of requisites. Come! We must take you before the One with Ten Powers.&rdquo; And, so saying, they went off with him to the Teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a966"></a><span class="t30">Becoming aware of their presence, the Teacher said, </span><span class="t18">{1.127}</span><span class="t30"> &ldquo;Wherefore is it, monks, that you have brought this monk against his will?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, this monk is well-off and has quite a stock of requisites.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it true, monk, as they say, that you are so well-off?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Fortunate One.&rdquo; &ldquo;But why, monk, have you amassed these belongings? Do not I extol the virtues of wanting little, contentment, and so forth, solitude, and determined resolve?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">Angered by the Teacher&rsquo;s words, he cried, &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go about like this!&rdquo; And, flinging off his outer clothing, he stood in their midst clad only in his waist-cloth.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a967"></a><span class="t30">Then, as a moral support to him, the Teacher said: &ldquo;Was it not you, monk, who in bygone days were a seeker after the shamefacedness that fears wrong, and even when you were a Water Rakkhasa lived for twelve years seeking after that shamefacedness? How then comes it that, after vowing to follow the weighty dispensation of the Buddha, you have flung off your outer robes and stand here devoid of shame?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">At the Teacher&rsquo;s word, his sense of shame was restored; he donned his robes again, and, saluting the Teacher, seated himself at the side.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">The monks having asked the Fortunate One to explain to them the matter he had mentioned, the Fortunate One made clear what had been concealed from them by rebirth.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a968"></a><a id="a969"></a><a id="a970"></a>In the past Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares in Kāsi. The Bodhisatta, having come to birth in those days as the king&rsquo;s son by the queen, was duly named prince Mahiṁsāsa. By the time he could run about, a second son was born to the king, and the name they gave this child was Candakumāra [prince Moon]; but by the time he could run about, the Bodhisatta&rsquo;s mother died. Then the king took another queen, who was his joy and delight; and their love was crowned with the birth of yet another prince, whom they named Sūriyakumāra [prince Sun]. In his joy at the birth of the boy, the king promised to grant her any boon she might ask on the child&rsquo;s behalf. But the queen treasured up the promise to be fulfilled at her own good time hereafter. Later, when her son had grown up, she said to the king, &ldquo;Sire, when my boy was born, you granted me a boon to ask for him. Let him be king.&rdquo;<a id="a971"></a><span class="t18"> [1.25]</span></p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;two sons have I, radiant as flaming fires; I cannot give the kingdom to your son.&rdquo; But when he saw that, undaunted by this refusal, the queen kept plaguing him time after time, to grant her request, <span class="t18">{1.128}</span> the king, fearing lest the woman should plot evil against his sons, sent for them and said: &ldquo;My children, when Sūriyakumāra was born, I granted a boon; and now his mother wants the kingdom for him. I have no wish to give him the kingdom; but women are naturally wicked, and she will be plotting evil against you. You had better retire to the forest, to return at my death to rule in the city which belongs by right to our house.&rdquo; So saying, with tears and lamentations, the king kissed his two sons on the head and sent them forth.</p>
<p class="p7">As the princes were leaving the palace after their adieux to their father, who should see them but Sūriyakumāra himself, who was playing in the courtyard? And no sooner did he learn what was the matter than he made up his mind to go with his brothers. So he too went off in their company.</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a972"></a>The three came to the region of the Himālayas; and here the Bodhisatta, who had turned aside from the road and was sitting at the foot of a tree, said to Sūriyakumāra, &ldquo;Run down to the pool yonder, Sūriya dear; drink and bathere; and then bring us too some water back in a lotus-leaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a973"></a>(Now that pool had been delivered over to a certain Water Rakkhasa by Vessavaṇa,<a id="a974"></a><a href="notes.html#a14659"><span class="t9">{214}</span></a> who said to him, &ldquo;With the exception of such as know what is truly god-like, all that go down into this pool are yours to devour. Over those that do not enter the waters, you have no power granted to you.&rdquo; And thenceforth the Water Rakkhasa used to ask all who went down into the pool what was the true Deva-Nature, devouring everyone who did not know.)</p>
<p class="p7">Now it was into this pool that Sūriyakumāra went down, quite unsuspiciously, with the result that he was seized by the Water Rakkhasa, who said to him, &ldquo;Do you know what is the true Deva-Nature?&rdquo; &ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the sun and moon.&rdquo; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the monster, and hauling the prince down into the depths of the water, imprisoned him there in his own abode. Finding that his brother was a long time gone, the Bodhisatta sent Candakumāra. He too was seized by the Water Rakkhasa and asked whether he knew what was the true Deva-Nature. &ldquo;Oh yes, I know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the four quarters of heaven are.&rdquo; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the Water Rakkhasa as he hauled this second victim off to the same prison-house.</p>
<p class="p7">Finding that this second brother too tarried long, the Bodhisatta felt sure that something had happened to them. So away he went after them and tracked their footsteps down into the water. <span class="t18">{1.129}</span> Realising at once <a id="a975"></a><span class="t18">[1.26]</span> that the pool must be the domain of a Water Rakkhasa, he girded on his sword, and took his bow in his hand, and waited. Now when the Rakkhasa found that the Bodhisatta had no intention of entering the water, he assumed the shape of a forester, and in this guise addressed the Bodhisatta thus, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired with your journey, mate; why don&rsquo;t you go in and have a bathe and a drink, and deck yourself with lotuses? You could travel on comfortably afterwards.&rdquo; Recognising him at once for a Rakkhasa, the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;It is you who have seized my brothers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it was,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Because all who go down into this pool belong to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;What, all?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not those who know what is the true Deva-Nature; all save these are mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;And do you want to know the true Deva-nature?&rdquo; &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; &ldquo;If this be so, I will tell you what is the true Deva-Nature.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do so, and I will listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7"><a id="a976"></a>&ldquo;I should like to begin,&rdquo; said the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;but I am travel-stained with my journey.&rdquo; Then the Water Rakkhasa bathed the Bodhisatta, and gave him food to eat and water to drink, decked him with flowers, sprinkled him with scents, and laid out a couch for him in the midst of a gorgeous pavilion. Seating himself on this couch, and making the Water Rakkhasa sit at his feet, the Bodhisatta said: &ldquo;Listen then and you shall hear what the the true Deva-Nature is.&rdquo; And he repeated this verse:</p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">1. Hiri-ottappasampannā, sukkadhammasamāhitā,</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="t12">Santo sappurisā loke Devadhammā ti vuccare ti.</span></p>
<p class="p22"><a id="a977"></a><span class="t4">Endowed with conscience and concern, having an unsullied nature, those virtuous and good people in the world are said to have Deva-nature. </span><span class="t18">{1.132}</span></p>
<p class="p23">And when the Yakkha heard this, he was pleased, and said to the Bodhisatta, &ldquo;Man of wisdom, I am pleased with you, and give you up one of your brothers. Which shall I bring?&rdquo; &ldquo;The youngest.&rdquo; &ldquo;Man of wisdom, though you know so well what the the true Deva-Nature is, you don&rsquo;t act on your knowledge.&rdquo; &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, you take the younger in preference to the elder, without regard to his seniority.&rdquo; &ldquo;I not only know, but practise, the true Deva-Nature. It was on this boy&rsquo;s account that we sought refuge in the forest; it was for him that his mother asked the kingdom from our father, and our father, refusing to fulfil her demand, consented to our flight to the refuge of the forest. With us came this boy, nor ever thought of turning back again. Not a soul would believe me if I were to give out that he had been devoured by a Rakkhasa in the forest; and it is the fear of odium that impels me to demand him at your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">&ldquo;Excellent! Excellent! O man of wisdom,&rdquo; cried the Rakkhasa in approval, &ldquo;you not only know, but practise, the true Deva-Nature.&rdquo; <span class="t18">{1.133}</span> And in token of his pleasure and approval he brought forth the two brothers and gave them both to the Bodhisatta.</p>
<p class="p7">Then said the latter to the Water Rakkhasa, &ldquo;Friend, it is in consequence of your own evil deeds in times past that you have now been born a Rakkhasa subsisting on the flesh and blood of other living creatures; and in this present birth too you are continuing to do evil. This evil conduct <a id="a978"></a><span class="t18">[1.27]</span> will for ever bar you from escaping rebirth in hell and the other evil states. Wherefore, from this time forth renounce evil and live virtuously.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p7">Having worked the Rakkhasa&rsquo;s conversion, the Bodhisatta continued to dwell at that spot under his protection, until one day he read in the stars that his father was dead. Then taking the Water Rakkhasa with him, he returned to Benares and took possession of the kingdom, making Candakumāra his viceroy and Sūriyakumāra his generalissimo. For the Water Rakkhasa he made a home in a pleasant spot and took measures to ensure his being provided with the choicest garlands, flowers, and food. He himself ruled in righteousness until he passed away to fare according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="t30">His lesson ended, the Teacher preached the Truths, at the close whereof that monk won the Fruit of the First Path. And the All-knowing Buddha, having told the two stories, made the connection linking the two together, and identified the Jātaka, by saying: &ldquo;The well-to-do monk was the Water Rakkhasa of those days; Ānanda was Sūriyakumāra, Sāriputta was Candakumāra, and I myself the eldest brother, prince Mahiṁsāsa.&rdquo;</span></p>
