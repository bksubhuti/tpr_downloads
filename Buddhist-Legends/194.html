As he went out with this food, he met an Elder on the road and said to him, &ldquo;Reverend Sir, here is some food which I received for administering medical treatment. Nowhere else will you receive food like this. Take it and eat it. Henceforth, whenever I receive such food as this in return for administering medical treatment, I will bring it to you.&rdquo; The Elder listened to what he said, but departed without saying a word. The monks went to the monastery and reported the matter to the Teacher.

<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Insolent, impudent, corrupt. </span><span class="t16">{3.352}</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">245. Hard is the life of the man who is modest, ever seeking what is pure,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Free from attachment, contained, blameless in conduct, possessed of vision clear. </span></p>
