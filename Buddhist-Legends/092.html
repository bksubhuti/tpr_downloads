<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veḷuvana with reference to Elder Sāriputta&rsquo;s nephew. <span class="t10">{2.232}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">For the Elder went to his nephew also and said, &ldquo;Brahman, do you ever do a single good deed?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Reverend Sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Month after month, I slay a single beast and tend the sacrificial fire.&rdquo; &ldquo;For what purpose do you do that?&rdquo; &ldquo;That, they say, is the way to the World of Brahmā.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who told you so?&rdquo; &ldquo;My teachers, Reverend Sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Neither you nor your teachers know the way to the World of Brahmā. Come, let us go to the Teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">So Elder Sāriputta conducted his nephew to the Teacher, informed the Teacher of the incident, and said to him, &ldquo;Reverend Sir, tell this man the way to the World of Brahmā.&rdquo; Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Brahman, are you correctly reported?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Sir Gotama.&rdquo; &ldquo;Brahman, though you should thus tend the sacrificial fire for a hundred years, yet would the merit of your performance not attain the worth of honor done to my disciple for even a single instant.&rdquo; So saying, he joined the connection, and preaching the Law, pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">107. Though a man for a hundred years should tend the sacrificial fire in the forest,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Yet, should he honor for even a single instant a man who has trained himself,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">It were better for him so to render honor than to offer sacrifice for a hundred years. </span></p>
