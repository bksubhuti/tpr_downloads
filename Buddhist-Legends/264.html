<p class="p8"><span class="t17">364. He whose garden of delight is the Law...</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Elder Dhammārāma.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">From the day when the Teacher announced, &ldquo;Four months hence I shall pass into Nibbāna,&rdquo; monks by the thousand spent their time in attendance upon the Teacher. Those who had not yet attained the Fruit of Conversion were unable to restrain their tears; those who had attained Arahatship experienced profound religious emotion; all went about in little groups, saying, &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; <span class="t10">{4.94}</span> But a single monk named He-Whose-Garden-of-Delight-is-the-Law, Dhammārāma, went nowhere near his brother monks. And when they asked him, &ldquo;What is the matter with you, brother?&rdquo; he gave them no answer. For Dhammārāma thought to himself, &ldquo;The Teacher has announced that four months hence he is to pass into Nibbāna, and I have not yet freed myself from the bondage of desire. Therefore so long as the Teacher remains alive, I will struggle and attain Arahatship.&rdquo; Accordingly Dhammārāma went about by himself, considering and pondering and calling to mind the Law preached by the Teacher.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The monks reported to the Tathāgata, &ldquo;Reverend Sir, Dhammārāma is devoid of affection for you. Since he heard us say, &lsquo;Four months hence the Teacher will pass into Nibbāna; what shall we do?&rsquo; he has had nothing to do with us.&rdquo; The Teacher caused Dhammārāma <span class="t10">[30.250]</span> to be summoned before him and asked him, &ldquo;Is the report true that you have done thus and so?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Reverend Sir, it is true.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why have you so done?&rdquo; &ldquo;This is the thought in my mind, &lsquo;You have announced that four months hence you are to pass into Nibbāna, and I have not yet freed myself from the bondage of desire; therefore while you yet remain alive, I will attain Arahatship.&rsquo; I am considering and pondering and calling to mind the Law which you have preached.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good! Good!&rdquo; exclaimed the Teacher, applauding him. Then said the Teacher to the monks, &ldquo;Monks, every other monk should show his affection for me just as Dhammārāma has done. For they that honor me with garlands, perfumes, and the like, honor me not; but they that practice the Higher and the Lower Law, they alone truly honor me.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">364. He whose garden of delight is the Law, he that delights in the Law, he that ponders the Law,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">He that meditates upon the Law, that monk will never fall away from the Good Law. </span><span class="t16">{4.95}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">At the conclusion of the lesson that monk was established in Arahatship; the assembled company also profited by the lesson. </p>
