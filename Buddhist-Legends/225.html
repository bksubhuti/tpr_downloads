<p class="p8"><span class="t17">292-293. For that which should be done...</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jātiyā Grove<a id="a950"></a><a href="notes.html#a2154"><span class="t9">{454}</span></a> near Bhaddiya with reference to the monks of Bhaddiya.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">It seems that these monks were in the habit of ornamenting their shoes, even as says the Sacred Word: &ldquo;Now at that time the monks of Bhaddiya were in the habit of wearing ornamental shoes of various kinds. They made or caused to be made shoes of tiṇa-grass; they made or caused to be made shoes of muñja-grass; they made or caused to be made shoes of babbaja-grass, of the leaves of the date-palm, of kamala-grass; they made or caused to be made woolen shoes. They neglected instruction, questioning, higher morality, higher meditation, higher wisdom.&rdquo; <span class="t10">{3.452}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">When the monks learned that these monks were given to this mode of conduct, they were offended and informed the Teacher. Thereupon the Teacher rebuked those monks, saying to them, &ldquo;Monks, you came here for one purpose, but have devoted yourselves to another.&rdquo; So saying, he preached the Law to them by pronouncing the following Stanzas,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">292. For that which should be done is left undone;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">And that is done which should be left undone;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">The Impurities of the arrogant and heedless ever increase.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">293. But they that ever devote themselves to Meditation on the Body,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">They follow not after that which should be left undone,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">But persevere in that which should be done;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">The Impurities of the thoughtful and intelligent come to an end. </span><span class="t16">{3.453}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">At the conclusion of the lesson, those monks were established in Arahatship; the assembled company also profited by the lesson. </p>
