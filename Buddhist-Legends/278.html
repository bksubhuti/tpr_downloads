<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain monk.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The story is told of a certain Brahman that he retired from the world under a teacher other than the Buddha, and having so done, thought to himself, &ldquo;The monk Gotama calls his own disciples &lsquo;monks;&rsquo; <span class="t10">{4.145}</span> I too am a monk, and he ought to apply that title to me too.&rdquo; So he approached the Teacher and asked him about the matter. Said the Teacher, &ldquo;It is not alone for the reason which you have given me that I call a man a monk. But it is because the evil passions and the impurities have <span class="t8">gone forth</span> from him that a man is called <span class="t8">one who has gone forth</span>, a monk.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">388. Because a man has put away evil, therefore is he called a Brahman;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Because he walks in righteousness, therefore is he called a monk;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Because he has banished his own impurities, therefore is he called a monk. </span></p>
