<p class="p8"><span class="t17">259. Not therefore is a man versed in the Law...</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Elder One-verse, Ekuddāna, an Arahat. <span class="t10">{3.384}</span></p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The story goes that Elder Ekuddāna dwelt quite alone in a certain forest-grove and that he knew but this one Solemn Utterance:</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8">To the monk of lofty thoughts, heedful, training himself in the ways of silence,</p>
<p class="p8">To such a monk, tranquil and ever mindful, sorrows come not.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">On Fast-days Elder Ekuddāna himself alone sounded the call to attend the preaching of the Law and uttered this Stanza, whereupon the deities shouted applause with a noise like that of the earth splitting open. Now it so happened that on a certain Fast-day two monks versed in the Tipiṭaka came to his place of abode, attended by a retinue of five hundred monks each. When he saw them, his heart was filled with joy, and he said to them, &ldquo;You have done well to come here; to-day <span class="t10">{3.385}</span> we will listen to the Law.&rdquo; &ldquo;But, brother, there <span class="t10">[30.142]</span> are no persons here to listen to the Law.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, there are. Reverend Sirs; on a day when the Law is expounded, this forest-grove is filled with the noise of the shouts of applause of the deities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">One of the Elders recited the Law and the other expounded the Law, but not even a single deity gave applause. Said the Elders, &ldquo;Brother, you said to us, &lsquo;On a day when the Law is expounded, the deities in this forest-grove give applause with a loud noise;&rsquo; what does this mean?&rdquo; &ldquo;Brethren, on other days there has been just such a noise; I do not know what is the matter to-day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then, brother, you just preach the Law.&rdquo; Elder Ekuddāna took the fan, and sitting in his seat, pronounced that one Stanza. The deities shouted applause with a loud noise.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">Now the twice five hundred attending monks were highly offended at the deities and said, &ldquo;The deities in this forest-grove show respect of persons in giving applause. Though monks versed in the Tipiṭaka uttered so much of the Law, they gave not so much as a world of approval; but just because a certain old Elder recited a single Stanza, they shouted applause with a loud noise.&rdquo; And going to the monastery, they reported the incident to the Teacher. <span class="t10">{3.386}</span> Said the Teacher, &ldquo;Monks, I call not him versed in the Law who knows or utters much of the Law; but whosoever masters even a single Stanza and clearly understands the Truths, such a man is verily and indeed versed in the Law.&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">259. Not therefore is a man versed in the Law for his much speaking.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">But he that hears ever so little, and evidences his perception of the Law by his acts,</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">He is indeed versed in the Law, for he fails not to heed the Law. </span></p>
