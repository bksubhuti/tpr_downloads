<p class="p0">This religious instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain monk who had once been an elephant-trainer.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The story goes that once upon a day this monk stood by the bank of the river Aciravatī watching an elephant-tamer try to break in an elephant. Observing that the elephant-tamer was not succeeding very well in teaching his elephant the tricks he wished to teach him, the monk said to some other monks who stood near, &ldquo;Brethren, if this elephant-trainer were to prick this elephant in such and such a place, he would very quickly teach him the trick he wishes to teach him.&rdquo; The elephant-trainer heard what he said, followed his suggestion, and soon compelled the elephant to submit to his will.</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p0">The monks reported the matter to the Teacher. The Teacher caused that monk to be summoned before him and asked him, &ldquo;Is it true that you said this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Reverend Sir, it is true.&rdquo; Thereupon the Teacher rebuked him and said, &ldquo;Vain man, what have you to do either with a riding-elephant or with any other tamed animal? For it is not on such riding-animals as these that a man can go to that <span class="t10">[30.201]</span> place to which he has not yet gone. <span class="t10">{4.6}</span> It is only on his own well-tamed self that he can go to that place to which he has not yet gone. Therefore tame yourself only; what have you to do with the taming of animals such as these?&rdquo; So saying, he pronounced the following Stanza,</p>
<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">323. For it is not on riding-animals such as these that one may go to that region to which one has not yet gone;</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="t17">Tamed must one go upon the tamed; namely, upon one&rsquo;s own well-tamed self. </span></p>
